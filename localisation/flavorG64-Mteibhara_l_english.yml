 mteibhar_ruinborn_marksmen_desc:0 "The advent of firearms was devasting when the colonizers retained a monopoly on them. However, we have since adopted their usage for ourselves. While we cannot fully replicate the top-of-the-line mechanisms of Cannorian muskets, our marksmen have taken to commission hand-rifled muskets using captured mechanisms. The resulting weapons, the Mteibhar Long Musket, are known for their massive range and high accuracy - now it's the Cannorians who have to deal with being shot at with no way to fight back."
