 mages_estate_events.1.d:0 "The status of the $ESTATE_MAGES$ does not rest on the privileges of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ or the wealth of $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. Instead their fortune and power comes from their innate magical prowess. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. Despite being few in number, through the vast influence and power within our society the $ESTATE_MAGES$ have managed to increase their power over our country."

 mages_estate_events.3.d:0 "It is no doubt that $ESTATE_MAGES$ suffer from the threat of the ever-rising influence of $ESTATE_ARTIFICERS$. Recent artificer discoveries have brought the age-old debate to light once again, on whether [Root.GetName] should stick with the old ways and harness magic traditionally, or use new innovations to control magic and make it available to all."

 mages_estate_events.4.d:0 "Within Anbennar and much of Western Cannor magical rulers have been seen as wise and almost divinely chosen. A noble within our realm wishes push his house in that direction, and petitions us to disinherit his eldest in favour of a younger, more magically-gifted heir. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ within our realm warn that this goes against the very traditions that keep [Root.GetName] together, whilst the the $ESTATE_MAGES$ subtly support one of their own in power, as usual."

The most recent case has been in [magical_spell_gone_wrong_province.GetName] which has damaged the province significantly.
