 A57_export_our_wine_title:0 "Export our Wine"
 A57_export_our_wine_desc:0 "Toarnen isn't and never was a trading hub and our geographical position does not make our county suitable for major trade.

<<<<<<< HEAD
 flavor_toarnen.1.d:0 "Nearly ninety years ago, burghers and some nobles led an insurrection against Toarnen and called the Moon Party to help, nearly costing us our independence. Their motivations were that the síl na Loop dynasty had increased too many taxes and levies in coastal areas of the county over the decades compared to the previous dynasty, a branch of the síl Arannen who bended often to the burghers. To calm their anger and to prevent war, the count Alann met the burghers at the port of Whitecliffs and conceded a treaty which granted a consequent autonomy to Bordercliff and to every port between Bordercliff and Sorncell."
