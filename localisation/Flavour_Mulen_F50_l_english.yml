 flavour_tluukt.1.title:0 "Patronizing the First Temple"
 flavour_tluukt.1.desc:0 "The priests of Eduz-Vacyn shuffle nervously, awaiting impatiently their uncertain fate in the wake of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s announced visit to the temple. When conquering Zokka visited the temple, he came to pillage and ruin. When conquering Jaher visited, he came to pray. [Root.Monarch.GetName] does neither - [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] merely observes the fading murals and the cracked edifices in scornful silence. Soon, under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] direction, the face of the temple changes - the damages caused by Zokka are repaired and the ancient edifices are restored to their past glory... but the people change too. The elven high-priests, many presiding since the days of Jaher, pass away one by one - illness and weakness, supposedly. They are replaced not by elves, but by men of no distinguished education and of dubious backgrounds. These men begin to rally against the elves, against Jaher, against the very foundation of the new teachings. They clamor for a return to the old ways, a return to a cult that glorifies Surakel and not mortal elves.\n\nThe rest of Bulwar has unsurprisingly condemned Eduz-Vacyn, seeing the taint of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s influence for what it is and censoring the teachings of the temple. But, in private, many Bulwari must wonder... how can the words of the First Temple, the place where the light of Surael first truly descended, be ignored so easily? No one speaks these thoughts aloud, but the tension of their presence can be felt all the same."

 tluukt_tluuktraak_reform:0 "The All-Cleaving Kingdom of Tluukt"
 tluukt_tluuktraak_reform_desc:0 "In the ancient days of Bulwar's bygone Age of Monsters, gnoll matriarchs ruled over the lesser gnoll packs and the native Bulwari in elaborate and sometimes even equitable hierarchies. The rise of the Great Xhaz, however, spelled the end of these arrangements, and though in the centuries since Bulwar has seen its fair share of kingdoms ruled by gnollkind, none come close to the glorious states concieved by those gnolls of antiquity - or so it was until Tluukt 'Cleaver-of-Realms' cleaved anew her own realm and codified the laws and hierarchies still in use today by the Tluuktraak."
