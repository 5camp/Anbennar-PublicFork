Although hesitant at first, under the pressure of her peers, she finally gave in, and took up arms to claim a throne that she does not consider her own.

Everyone shed a tear. The news of an assembly of the country's biggest mind still alive rapidly circumnavigated the country, from which emanated a series of reforms greatly improving the unity of the people, opening the door to further, deeper and more effective reforms."
 aelnar.18.d.b:0 "After years of torning each other apart, the bloody civil war finally came to an end.
