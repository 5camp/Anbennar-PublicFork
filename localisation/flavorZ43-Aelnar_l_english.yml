 aelnar.1.t:0 "Zenith"
 aelnar.1.d:0 "It is obvious to all that today, our people have nothing to do with what it was a few decades ago. Our ambitions, our traditions, our desires, our morals. We grew up, and reached new heights. It is time to get rid of the chains of the past, and to embrace our destiny with all our strength. A destiny that we will engrave with the strength of our arms in the immense rock of time. May the world tremble, that the child of Venail and Munas no longer exists.

 aelnar.2.d:0 "The previous reforms of our nations have centralized power around a single dynasty, trusting the blood of one family to ensure the prosperity of our people.

 aelnar.6.a:0 "Thus is born ; Calasandur Starseeker"
 
 aelnar.7.t:0 "Storm Wind"
 aelnar.7.d:0 "Taking advantage of the weak royal power, powerful noble families with ancestral roots demanded the establishment of distinct and well-established privilege, in order to be able to govern their fiefdoms more effectively. Although this seems to be a good idea at first sight, it is actually an act of defiance, barely masked, towards the royal power. In parallel, many peasants took up arms, to defend their rights, after losing confidence in the royal power."
 aelnar.7.a:0 "We need to enforce our control!"
 
 aelnar.8.t:0 "Sicrheior Ideas"
 aelnar.8.d:0 "Sicrheior is a well known elf across the country. Author of several books extolling the merits of a rapid expansion of Aelnar's borders, to the detriment of all other aspects of the country, saw the possibility of seizing power, and applying his ideas by force.

 aelnar.12.t:0 "The Six Paths"
 aelnar.12.d:0 "Born in the minds of many philosophers, the idea of ​​our people subject to the will of any god is unacceptable to many elves. If religion we must have, then it will be a religion of state, in the service of the country, in the service of the people.

 aelnar.12.a:0 "Soise Vio"

 aelnar.13.d:0 "Warrior with multiple scars, witnesses of his centennial experience, Kayd has always refused to go up in the hierarchy of the army, despite the many proposals that were made to him, persuaded that he would be more useful on the battlefield than behind it. Confident in his beliefs, for him, the future of Aelnar will be forged through blood and steel, because it is the only way to forge a warrior. As that is exactly what a nation as great as Aelnar should be... A warrior. And numerous are those believing in his idea"
 aelnar.13.a:0 "A Worthy Opponent"
 
 aelnar.14.t:0 "Aelthanas Ideas"
 aelnar.14.d:0 "Born in a family of glass worker, Aelthanas and his philosophy boasts the merit of the group rather than the individual. For him and his followers, Aelnar must unite from the bottom, not from the top. Every decision affecting the lives of millions of people, who better than these millions of people to choose their destiny ? A new republic, more just than the preceding, is the only viable solution for the future of Aelnar in the eyes of Aelthanas."
 aelnar.14.a:0 "Take him down!"

 aelnar.15.d:0 "Known throughout the country as the first to land on what is now the great city of Aelnar, Lithiel is recognized by the people as "the heroine of the reconquest". There is not a battlefield, not a city where she has not set foot. Because of her notoriety and her prestige, many see in her the revival of the royalty of Aelnar, through a noble and virtuous blood. Although hesitant at first, under the pressure of her peers, she finally gave in, and took up arms to claim a throne that she does not consider her own. But in order not to disappoint the expectations of her supporters, and perhaps put an end to this civil war, she walks today towards the capital, at the head of an army ready to die for her."

 aelnar.18.t:0 "Peace in our time"
 aelnar.18.d:0 "After years of tearing each other apart, a semblance of unity seems to bring together the elves of Aelnar one more time. As [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] approaches the royal balcony, overlooking the royal square, he expresses himself, looking stern but sad; 'We understood each other.'\n Through this unique sentence, the various representatives of multiple factions, the inhabitants of the city and peasants of the countries, warriors, veteran, saint, everyone. Everyone shed a tear. The news of an assembly of the country's biggest mind still alive rapidly circumnavigated the country, from which emanated a series of reforms greatly improving the unity of the people, opening the door to further, deeper and more effective reforms."
 aelnar.18.d.b:0 "After years of tearing each other apart, the bloody civil war finally came to an end. Known across the country as the Rianvisa, many new ideas have emerged, shared across the country by blood and fire. And even if today, many families and thinkers have paid the price, finally, a semblance of serenity seems to have returned to the country. "

 aelnar.20.d:0 "The first victims of the Aelnar conquests, the Noruin natives never could adapt to the new system imposed on them. As the country sinks into chaos and anarchy, there is no better time to rebel than now."

 aelnar.21.t:0 "Calasandur Takes Arm!"
 aelnar.21.d:0 "As chaos gnawing the country spread to the gates of the imperial capital, an exhausted messenger knocked at the door of the throne room, bringing with him some dark news from the front. Contemplating the horizon through one of the huge windows of the throne room, Calasandur turns to his sword, laying on the wall.\n\n'Dread it... Run from it. Destiny still arrives. And it's here... Or should i say...'"

 aelnar.24.t:0 "One Who Would Be Queen"
 aelnar.24.d:0 "The war that has riven our empire is finally over, with the last of the pretenders put down. The defeat of Lithiel was the final nail in the coffin of popular support for our overthrow, and now we have the task of sorting out the aftermath, starting with She who would have been Queen."
 aelnar.24.a:0 "Her death invites more trouble then its worth, imprison her."
 aelnar.24.b:0 "We can accept no treason to the state, have her executed."
 aelnar.24.c:0 "Lithiel did not rebel willingly, but believed she had to. She might make a good consort."
 
 aelnar.25.t:0 "The Empress Regent"
 aelnar.25.d:0 "Grave Tidings, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is dead. Lithiel mourns, and the nation mourns with her. This has unfortunately brought up the thorny issue of succession, and while Lithiel is indeed grief stricken, several are already pushing for her to take the throne in her spouse's place."
 aelnar.25.a:0 "The people love her, all hail our new Empress."
 aelnar.25.b:0 "Our advisors step above themselves, she will never Rule."

 aelnar.26.a:0 "A New Moncarch for a New Age."
 
 aelnar.27.t:0 "Duties of an Empress"
 aelnar.27.d:0 "It seems that more and more papers and decrees are beginning to reach our monarch's desk, either because of her popularity, or the assurance that she will give her full attention to it. It seems now that every appointment and decision must be approved by Lithiel, no matter how small."
 aelnar.27.a:0 "We can only hope she does not try to do too much..."
 
 aelnar.28.t:0 "Struggle within, Struggle without"
 aelnar.28.d:0 "Our Empress is alone. Of course she is surrounded by admirers and advisors at almost all times, but no one that she can actually confide in or talk to as a person. She is an empress, and every moment of every day must go into keeping up that appearence. And it is wearing on her. Cracks sometimes appear in her perfect facade, and in her weaker moments, she hears another voice, one whispering to blow it all away. A voice that only through Lithiel's iron control once remained silent. Elissa is her name, and she desires only one thing. Complete Control."
 aelnar.28.a:0 "Duty is heavy as a mountain, Death is light as a feather."
 
 aelnar.29.t:0 "The Mask Cracks"
 aelnar.29.d:0 "Tragedy has struck today. Lithiel is gone, though her body remains. During a routine audience in the throne room, our glorious empress slumped and fell over on her throne, and none of her advisors nor her guards have found a way to rouse her. She seems to be in an almost magical sleep and all of our greatest medical minds are baffled. The strangest thing is that her body is cold to the touch, almost cold enough to give her attendants frostbite as they tried to help. And she keeps muttering one word over and over, like a delirious chant. 'Elissa'."
 aelnar.29.a:0 "Her Country needs her."
 
 aelnar.30.t:0 "Assassination Attempt"
 aelnar.30.d:0 "No one knows who sent them, or even what their name was. But last night, an assassin stole into Arca Ore and reached our empress' chamber without being challenged. And once there, they made sure that Lithiel's sleep would never end."
 aelnar.30.a:0 "Maybe it was for the best."
 aelnar.30.b:0 "By the Six, what have we done."
 
 aelnar.31.t:0 "The Ice Fall"
 aelnar.31.d:0 "The assassin succeeded, Lithiel's sleep is now eternal. Unfortunately, what woke instead is something much, much worse. The voice of madness that Lithiel strove her most to contain, eventually striking her down, is now free, wearing our Empress's skin as her own. And her first action with her new body was to reward the assassin. By obliterating him with pillars and spears of ice, along with the entire royal palace. Arca Ore is now a monument of destruction, captured in its death throws and shattered towers, with a sound that woke the empire. And the only person to emerge from its carnage was our Empress, clothed in raiments of snow and chill, sapping the warmth from everything around her. Hail Lithiel reborn. Hail our Queen Returned."
 aelnar.31.a:0 "Lithiel is Mine..."
 
 aelnar.32.t:0 "The Crystal Queen"
 aelnar.32.d:0 "Lithiel has demanded that the heads of our empire come to the shattered frozen ruins of our capital for a feast celebrating her awakening. They were not given the option of refusing. Once there, in a cleared out space where the throne hall once stood, Lithiel had crowned herself in frost to oversee this twisted mockery of the once noble court, and bade her guests to drink and eat. Once the meal was over, she stood again, upon the remains of the throne, wreathed in majesty, and proclaimed herself queen of a new Aelnar. Queen of Frost. The Crystal Queen. And that every knee and heart will bow to her, and swear an Oath of loyalty past even death."
 aelnar.32.a:0 "On Bended Knees We Swear."
 
 aelnar.33.t:0 "The Icy Ambitions"
 aelnar.33.d:0 "The destruction of Arca Ore and the attempted assassination of our Empress almost tore the heart from our empire, but it did destroy its administration. However, our Crystal Queen survived, and the capital can be rebuilt. Lithiel has come up with plans for a new capital, one that will match her icy majesty. These plans will require even more effort and materials then what was used for the original palace, but Lithiel has already solved the problem of magical muscle. The ruinborn of our empire are much more useful then the vermin they resemble, able to store and absorb excessive amounts of magical energy from their surroundings. Our Empress has devised a way for our own mages to tap this well as if the ruinborn were living batteries of power. Finally they will have a use."
 aelnar.33.a:0 "Long Live the Queen"
 
 aelnar.34.t:0 "The Lady Retires"
 aelnar.34.d:0 "Time marches forwards, leaving those of a past age behind. The Star Elves are no different, no matter how much we strive to stay ahead. Today in the empire, Lithiel has signaled her intention to leave public life until her fading days. While she once rebelled against our just rulers, we can only mourn the loss of such a beloved public figure. A mourning festivity has already been planned to see her away from the harbor on her trip to Silent Repose, where she will spend her remaining years."
 aelnar.34.a:0 "Good Trip"
 
 aelnar.35.t:0 "Arca Lithiaer"
 aelnar.35.d:0 "Today, in our new frozen land that Lithiel has proclaimed as the new capital of our empire, the palace slowly rises into the air. Made of ice and stone, and powered by crystallized magic, this new floating fortress will be the new beating heart of our administration, and is the first step in recapturing the glory we once held. We will rise above the precursors. We are the Stars!"
 aelnar.35.a:0 "We have only begun."
 
 aelnar.36.t:0 "A Time Served"
 aelnar.36.d:0 "Lithiel has carried out her sentence for rebelling against our empire during the Rianvisa. While some would argue that no punishment is too great for such treason, we have found in our infinite mercy grounds to let her leave unopposed."
 aelnar.36.a:0 "May she do good once again."
 
 aelnar.37.t:0 "A Grand Escape"
 aelnar.37.d:0 "Lithiel is free. What we can only assume is some misguided loyalty to a general who should have been abandoned, Lithiel was freed from prison through an escape both ingenious and audacious. A commotion was caused at the prison and a fire was lit, causing many of the guards to be drawn away to fight the blaze. Guards we assume to have been loyal to the renegade general were left to guard her cell, and unlocked it and replaced her with a body double. We know that Lithiel was then shepherded through the postern gate, where she was intercepted by a random patrol that stumbled upon them. The guards tried valiantly, but they were no match for a battle hardened explorer like Lithiel. We only know of this because one of the guards managed to survive his wounds long enough to tell the Warden. Our advisors already ordered an immediate closure of the harbor to find her, but it is unlikely to matter, as too much time has already passed, and more then 50 ships have been in and out of the wharfs. We must prepare for the worst, and assume that Lithiel will remain a sword at our neck until she perishes, no matter where she has landed."
 aelnar.37.a:0 "Curses!"
 
 aelnar.38.t:0 "A Soldier with no Home"
 aelnar.38.d:0 "A general from the land of Stars who once raised her flag in rebellion for the people has arrived today in our court, offering her services in exchange for a home. Do we accept this Lithiel to lead our armies?"
 aelnar.38.a:0 "Welcome her."
 aelnar.38.b:0 "We do not need to anger the Stars."
 
 aelnar.39.t:0 "The Next Chapter"
 aelnar.39.d:0 "Our ruler is dead. After guiding our people through dark times, and charting a new path through fraught waters, they have finally succumbed to times embrace. And now that the time of mourning has come to a close, the people are demanding a new leader to take their place. Our ruler's heir is not an acceptable person in the eyes of the stars, overshadowed as they were by their parents grandeur. Instead, two other names have been put forward, two of the great voices of our rebirth. Calasunder, a general and warrior of tradition and refinement, and Lithiel, and explorer and hero of the people."
 aelnar.39.a:0 "Lithiel leads us Forwards into the Future."
 aelnar.39.b:0 "Calasander must Reinforce Tradition."
 
 aelnar.40.t:0 "Lithiel's Dream"
 aelnar.40.d:0 "Lithiel has revealed to her advisors her plan for the foreseeable future. An empire of worth, one that will never fall down again. Every person giving what they can, and then more. And for this dream to succeed she requires every citizen of elven blood, even those once overlooked. She has put forth the radical ideal of rewarding work with honor and recognition, elevating those of the ruinborn that work with our great empire rights and duties once thought exclusive to the star elves. While never being truly equal, it will give them incentives to excel under her rule. The advisors were apprehensive of the plan, but in the end agreed."
 aelnar.40.a:0 "She has yet to lead us wrong..."
 
 aelnar.41.t:0 "An Eye in Every City"
 aelnar.41.d:0 "Whispers of discontent and treachery twine their way through our empire, the lie of such a thing just as insidious as the truth. It has come to our advisors even within our ivory towers, and for that reason the situation has become intolerable. The creation of a secret police, to ferret out these malcontents, no matter where they hide is of the utmost importance. We shall gather a group of the most supremely talented and loyal people in the empire to make up this new apparatus that is answerable only to our supreme sovereign. Let nothing escape our Crystal Eye."
 aelnar.41.a:0 "An ear at every door."
 
 aelnar.42.t:0 "Ruinborn Culture"
 aelnar.42.d:0 "Some of the ruinborn we rule have taken it upon themselves to act in a more civilized manner, copying our traditions and cultures without truly understanding the art behind them. Barbarians must start somewhere after all."
 aelnar.42.a:0 "So even savages can act civilized."
 
 aelnar.43.t:0 "Duskers Rise"
 aelnar.43.d:0 "After years of hardship and struggle, we finally recognize the duskers of [prov_id] as valued members of our society. Let them wear the title of Starborn proudly. Let them be reborn in our light!"
