 G52_state_city_title: "State for the City"
 G52_state_city_desc: "As we expand eastward and deliver stability to the war-torn peninsula of Taychend, we must also continue to strengthen our powerbase closer to home. The Basobhar near us control plenty of fields ripe for farming, forests teething with lumber, and hills waiting patiently for their ores to be uncovered.\nWe must send forward our own settlers and claim these lands in the name of Ameion."
 G52_approach_mteibhar_title: "Approach the Mteibhar"
 G52_approach_mteibhar_desc: "The Mteibhar gather in their valley peacefully every once and a while to partake in their religious practices. If we were to attend one of these gathers, we can use their banner of peace to conduct diplomacy with their leadership, and lay the groundwork for their incorporation under Ameion like the Taychendi. They will not submit voluntairly, but knowing and respecting their customs will relieve any tensions their subjugation will create."
 G52_place_exile_title: "Place of Exile"
 G52_place_exile_desc: "While the vast majority of Taychendi have benefitted from our rule, there are some who are adamant about their desire to rule themselves. Regardless of evidence to the contrary, they insist they would be better off without our intervention.\n\nThose of Vul Tenvach have been more diplomatic, and offered a proposition: we shall fund and assist their efforts to settle an uninhabited island to the east, where those discontent with our rule can exile to.\n\nWhile peculiar, having a place to put those with no hope of saving from their destructive ways may prove beneficial to the majority who remain here."
 G52_peace_coexistance_title: "Peace Through Coexistance"
 G52_peace_coexistance_desc: "Considering the size of this island, the fact that we have found no evidence of civilization here has become quite interesting. While the Taychendi methods are crude, they are vastly superior to allow the land to sit empty of cities. Under our authority, perhaps their culture can flourish into something other than a wasteland."

 G52_isle_severance_title: "The Isle of Severance"
 G52_isle_severance_desc: ""
 
 G52_city_state_title: "City for the State"
 G52_city_state_desc: "While our strength is comparable, if not greater, than the true kheions from which our ancestors hail, it is known that Ameion is not as glorious a city as the kheions. As we seek to civilize the Taychendi, we must demonstrate the core priciple of Kheionism; the place and power of the city within a civilization."
 G52_approach_chendhyan_title: "Approach the Chendhyan"
 G52_approach_chendhyan_desc: "The feline-riders of the Chendhyan steppes not only partake in barbaric acts of raid and plunder, but they embody them. To them, their freedom must come at the expense of others. If we are to prevent these practices, we must not only understand them, but show them the consequences of their hostilities."
 G52_embrace_humble_title: "Embrace the Humble"
 G52_embrace_humble_desc: "The Devandi value their liberty highly, but as far as the average man is concerned what matters most is their day-to-day life. We may win easy victories over their armies, but what will keep them from rising again shall be how we improve their lives under our rule. There may be glory in raiding, but they shall learn the comforts of a well tended field."
 G52_kheion_past_title: "Kheion Past Alecand"
 G52_kheion_past_desc: "Ameion has grown as a kheion significantly in recent years, fueled by the wealth of Taychend. In many ways it has become superior to the true kheions of the west, and it is time we gain recognition for this. Bringing representatives from Alecand to showcase our mighty capital will prove to them the kheionai lifestyle is attainable even beyond their home island."
 G52_islands_uncivilized_title: "Islands Uncivilized"
 G52_islands_uncivilized_desc: "As we began to settle the islands surrounding Taychend, one we did not spend effort on is known as Purti. At the time Laskaris decided it would spread our efforts too thin, and a settlement there may have been put under siege by [G71.GetName].\n\nNow that we have secured our position in Taychend, the opportunity to properly secure this island has arrived, and may find use as a stepping stone both into Taychend, and islands rumoured to exist to the east."
 G52_tribes_nations_title: "From Tribes to Nations"
 G52_tribes_nations_desc: "Now that we have secured the loyalty of the Devandi, we must show them how a proper nation is operated. The day will soon come when their peoples laugh at the ways of their ancestors, and will thank us for showing them how to live peacefully under a common flag. The Mteibhara are already accustomed to residing in one place, so they may find this process easier than their mounted kin."
 G52_children_valley_title: "Children of the Valley"
 G52_children_valley_desc: "So long as there are Devandi tribes not under our rule, they will continue to raid and pillage each other, tearing down each others hopes of a brighter future. If we are to allow true growth across the Devand, we must extend our rule across it.\n\nThe tribes all trace their origin to a common point, so this burgeoning civilization has the identity necessary to unify."
 G52_devandi_brethren_title: "Devandi Brethren"
 G52_devandi_brethren_desc: "While Taychend has proved a difficult beast to tame, Devand has been a fiercer one. This is because while the average Devandi had less than the average Taychendi, they were relatively happier with their way of life before our arrival.\n\nBut we did not allow them to stagnate in their comfort. While they took pride in their raiding skills, we taught them to empathize with the victims of such violence. While their peaks and rivers provided them plenty of water, we taught them irrigation to provide them even more. Our brothers here have come far, but there is farther yet to go."

 G52_echate_league_title: "The Échate League"
 G52_echate_league_desc: "The nékheis were founded by the kheions over a millenium ago for the twin purposes of finding resources for the kheions, and to create homes for those overcrowding the cities to move to. Our own origins lie in the nékheis, and we have always prefered diplomacy with them, if nothing else due to their proximity.\n\n[G62.GetName] recently found itself without a kheion overlord due to the fall of [G61.GetName], and this gives us an opportunity to create an alliance between the two of us, and the nékhei between us: [G56.GetName]. With our leadership, the Andic Reach could become a new center of power in the Kheionai world: The Échate League."
 G52_establish_borders_title: "Establish Borders"
 G52_establish_borders_desc: "The first matter to settle to ensure the prosperity of the Échate League is to ensure we are on the same page regarding our settling of the Andic Reach. The kheions squabble with each other for the coastline of the Devand, and we must ensure such petty disputes do not fracture us as it has them."
 G52_common_military_title: "Common Military"
 G52_common_military_desc: "Our friends in the Échate League are useful to have as allies, but as Laskaris ruled our city alone they lack the military standards we have come to expect. We shall organize their armies to our standards, and in the process take the opprotunity to cross-reference tactics and mutually develop more effective methods of combat."
 G52_rising_state_title: "A Rising State"
 G52_rising_state_desc: "The Kylakas of the west dream of a unified state; those in Alecand seek to overthrow their peers and unite their island. Our ancestors in Devand dreamed of uniting the nékheis into a united front free from the control of the homeland. Now, we have built our own state, one crossing the barrier between the Kheionai, the Devandi, and the Taychendi.\n\nThere is work to be done before these segments of our society are united, but the foundations have been made for a state primed to rule all of these lands, and to unite them all under one identity."
 G52_new_cities_title: "New Cities"
 G52_new_cities_desc: "As we continue our expansion into lands once held by the Bashobhar, our duty to bring propserity to these lands comes with us. Where there were once scattered tribes no different than those when the kheions first settled the nékheis, there will stand new cities, centers of progress in the Devandi interior."
 G52_united_diplomacy_title: "United Diplomacy"
 G52_united_diplomacy_desc: "The Échate League settles along common borders, fights with common tactics, and champions the same causes. The only thing left is to unify our efforts diplomatically once and for all.\n\nNaturally, as the largest member of the League, we are the one best suited to lead this common effort, and under our guidance our two compatriots will share in our glory."
 G52_summit_ameion_title: "Summit of Ameion"
 G52_summit_ameion_desc: "Ameion has become a patchwork of peoples from the steppes of the Chendhya to the hills of Taychend with our glorious kheion at the heart of it all. Trade routes that were once perilous are now commonly traversed, and while the language of the kheions is becoming gradually adopted across the board, the cultures that exist in our periphery are still distinct.\n\nAs the priciple city of this state, it is our duty to bring together the peoples of our city into one identity. Let us gather representatives from the various ways of life to knit the seperate threads into a common quilt."
 G52_kheionai_brethren_title: "Kheionai Brethren"
 G52_kheionai_brethren_desc: "Unlike any other people in these lands, the kheionai are uniquely accepting of the waters. While even we do not often dare to venture over the open sea, we frequently sail along the coastlines of Alecand, Devand, and Taychend to trade with others.\n\nUnder our leadership, these coastlines have become safer and more profitable to those who sail them. The interconnectivity brought by trade has fostered ties across our holdings, and it is us kheionai who make these journeys."
 G52_civilization_brothers_title: "Civilization of Brothers"
 G52_civilization_brothers_desc: "As odd peoples from across the seas arrive near our shores, it becomes obvious that our peoples have more in common with each other than we once believed. We may have different shades of skin, or some the ability to grow hair upon their face, but we are all born from the ruins of so called 'Precursors', and who we are today stems from how our ancestores responded to this. It has been us kheionai who have championed the civilized ways of these Precursors, but the Devandi have taught us to value our freedom, and the Taychendi show that even in the midst of our ancestor's legacy we have much to learn.\n\nMany of our cousins in far away lands find themselves invaded and enslaved by these outsiders, but we will build ourselves stronger, fight with the ferocity of a lion, but not be afraid to learn from them should their ways prove superior. Our cousins were too few in number to resist their fate, but with our brothers at our side we will stand unfliching in the face of foreign powers."

 G52_first_kneel_title: "The First to Kneel"
 G52_first_kneel_desc: "Many have deemed us invaders and conquerers, but those in Korrimutren saw us for what we are: a force of stability seeking to bring peace to these lands. It was they alone who knelt before Laskaris, and they alone who have shared in the rewards, and their city has since known prosperity. We shall teach their leaders the priciples of civilization, and the victories that follow shall show the Taychendi the benefits of aligning with us."
 G52_against_warlords_title: "Against Warlords"
 G52_against_warlords_desc: "As we tame the lands of Laskaris' initial foothold, we see the fruit of our labor begin to manifest already in Korrimutren. There their elite gather in their capital, eager to adopt the ways of the civilized world. It shall be far easier to bring them into the fold when they speak our langauge, and easier to administer them when they view politics through the same lens we do."
 G52_prepare_push_title: "Prepare the Next Push"
 G52_prepare_push_desc: "Carefully coordinated, our march across Taychend is not the chaotic barbarity that the Taychendi are accostomed to. Instead it is a planned course, learning of local defenses and military capabilities of our enemy before we engage them. They may have strength in numbers, but we have strength in capability."
 G52_civilization_taychend_title: "Civilization in Taychend"
 G52_civilization_taychend_desc: "We push ever closer to the [G64.Government.GetName] of [G64.GetName], and it is becoming increasingly obvious the fate of Taychend shall be decided between us. We are reluctant to admit it, but we are not yet prepared to take them on in a head-on battle. However, as we continue to bring peace in our wake, we continue to differentiate ourselves from their tyranny. While they rule over their subjects with an iron first, we shall handle ours with gloves of [G61.GetAdjective] silk."
 G52_across_hills_title: "Line Across Rolling Hills"
 G52_across_hills_desc: "A line is drawn across Taychend; on one side there is Larankar, the would-be unifiers of Taychend. On the other side is us, the 'foreign interloper' meddling in their plans for domination. We both claim to fight for peace, but it is only us who can truly provide it.\n\nWhat makes us different is that Larankar fights within the framework of Taychendi barbarism, they do not hesitate to brutalize those who would stand against them, and ultimately seek only to enrich themselves. We need not such petty goals, we will upend the warlords infesting these lands, and establish a rule here worthy of the legacy of those who came before us."
 G52_basis_civilization_title: "Basis of Civilization"
 G52_basis_civilization_desc: "As we continue to bring the Taychendi people away from their destructive dieties, they have begun to adopt the ways of the kheion. Their farms are now managed from centralized towns instead of by whatever warlord recently killed the other, irrigation has begun to allow their already mighty population to blossom, and the turmoil once in these lands is becoming a thing of the past.\n\nThis is what total victory looks like, when even those defeated celebrate your victory."
 G52_ways_west_title: "Ways of the West"
 G52_ways_west_desc: "The Taychendi refer to us as 'Kheyeana' in reference to our status of originating to the west of Taychend. The preservation of the kheions in the face of armageddon has established them as the truest conservation of what came before, and as the Taychendi tore each other apart, us Kheyeana set out to rebuild this world.\n\nWe have honed this craft over centuries, and now in the face of the ruins of Taychend, we have the expertise to restore these lands to the glory that once existed here. We may be from their West, but with our guidance they will some day be the people pushing outwards to rebuild in another direction."
 G52_taychendi_brethren_title: "Taychendi Brethren"
 G52_taychendi_brethren_desc: "When destruction came to Taychend, its people proved unable to restore that which existed here. We do not hate them for this, but it has necessiated our intervention to bring glory back to these lands.\n\nIt took our people centuries to make the most of the kheions against the Kaydhano, and here we do not even know for what purpose its wonders were built. But we do know that so long as we work alongside the Taychendi, we will help them become as distinguished as us."

While our victory was great, all of these states still stand to fight another day, and it is only a matter of time before they join together again in an attempt to drive us out.

 G52_collision_destiny_title: "Collision of Destiny"
 G52_collision_destiny_desc: "When Laskaris first set foot in Taychend, even before his conquests, he quickly learned of Larankar, and how they descended from their hills with the aim of conquering the rest of Taychend. Since then, it has always been known that they would pose the biggest threat to our rule here.\n\nLaskaris knew his destiny would create one for Ameion as a whole, one where we face down this empire once and for all, and break it. We shall not fail him."
 G52_stands_falls_title: "One Stands, One Falls"
 G52_stands_falls_desc: "The calm beaches of the Thekvrystana, the rolling hills of the Yodhanpir, the roaring Kalavend, the hidden highlands of the Laranakarha, all strewn with bodies and stained with blood. The Taychendi are a people eager for conflict, but at last that fight has been taken from them.\n\nThe mightiest of their tribes, Laranakar, stands broken by our efforts, despite the aid of their kin. We came here to bring peace, and with this magnficient war that promise approaches its precipice.\n\nThere will be no more needless bloodshed, no more citizens cowering in fear of warbands and armies. They mustered their greatest against us, and now only their meek remain. We shall rebuild these lands in our image; the image of our ancestors."

While this tribe may prove a thorn in the side of those uninformed, [G63.GetName] may prove to be a a respectable civilization under our guidance, even if they must be convinced by force."
 flavor_ameion.11.d2: "''I met with [G63.Monarch.GetTitle] [G63.Monarch.GetName] in his domain of [G63.Capital.GetName] in an attempt to show them the benefits of Ameioni rule, but learned of their traditions of independence, and past rebellion against slavery. I have deduced the key to incorporating them is to treat them as equals, and show they have nothing to fear from us. While these tribals may prove a thorn in the side of the nékheis, [G63.GetName] may prove to be a a respectable civilization under our guidance, even if they must unfortunately be convinced by force.\n\nThe incense was quite nice though.''\n\n -Journal of Laskaris"

 flavor_ameion.12.d1: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] ventured north into the Chendhyan steppes with the intention of learning of their customs and guaging interest in benefitting from Ameioni rule. He recieved his answer at the tip of a spear, with him and most of his entourage slaughtered and mauled by their felines.\n\nIt is clear their barbarity shall only be ended by the might of the phalanx, and they will be taught to despise the acts of their ancestors."
 flavor_ameion.12.d2: "''As my entourage and I were crossing a stream, we were set upon by a band of Chendhyans mounted on their cats, seemingly with the intent to kill me for my atrocious act of diplomacy. Unfortunately they seemed to not know who I am, and watched helplessly as I dodged multiple projectiles and cut down several of their mounts.\n\nOne of them, who had more sense than the others, begged my mercy and brought me to [H29.Capital.GetName] and recounted our encounter to his [H29.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nEager for live proof, the [H29.Monarch.GetTitle] shot several arrows at me, which I deflected and doged with east. What did surprise me, however, was that the [H29.Monarch.GetTitle] then knelt before me, pledging his [H29.GovernmentName] to my rule.\n\nThe negotiations proved short, but I doubt the others will kneel so easily.''\n\n -Journal of Laskaris"

 flavor_ameion.13.d: "The nékhei closest to us, Deyeion, is ruled by [event_target:G52_G56_overlord.GetName] despite its considerable distance from Alecand proper. [G62.GetName] found liberty after its founder fell in wars with its neighbors, but now we must move the wheel forward to see self rule in the Andic Reach fufilled."

 flavor_ameion.14.t: "Échate League Agrees to Borders"
 flavor_ameion.14.d: "As Kheionai settlers push into the interior of the Devand, they compete with not only the Basobhar, but each other for land. Today, the three members of the Échate League: [G62.GetName], [G56.GetName], and of course [G52.GetName] gather to set aside their differences so that they can focus on the growth of their states. The focus on natural borders ensures there will be little room for future conflicts, and signatures between the three [G52.Monarch.GetTitle] seals the fate of the Andic Reach."
 flavor_ameion.14.a: "For the growth of the League!"
 
 flavor_ameion.15.t: "Civilization of Exiles"
 flavor_ameion.15.d: "The Taychendi settlers arrive on the island, devoid of any form of civilization. Not even primal tribes wander across the trees and cliffs on this landmass. Here they will build a place for their values, however backward, to survive. So long as this reserve exists, those who foolishly challenge our rule on the mainland will have no allies to muster, and will ultimately submit, or come here."
 flavor_ameion.15.a: "A containment zone for their barbarity."
 
 flavor_ameion.16.t: "Taychendi Request Land"
 flavor_ameion.16.d: "Following the Ameioni conquests of Taychend, some within the nation have sought refuge in [2324.GetName], where they seek to establish a place for those against Ameioni rule to live. However, this outpost has been supported by Ameion itself, and will at least nominally be loyal to it."

 flavor_ameion.17.d: "Laranakr, the next warlord in the line of many seeking to unite their subcontinent, makes one last stand against our dominance of the region. In the face of what they consider a common enemy, many men who would have otherwise stood aside rise to defend their way of life.\n\nIdeally they would see the error of their ways and join us in striking down the very tyrants who oppress them, but no matter. We shall drag them screaming into a better life."
 flavor_ameion.17.a: "Strike them at their strongest."
 
 flavor_ameion.18.t: "Taychend Defiant"
 flavor_ameion.18.d: "Across Taychend, many have taken up arms to join the efforts of Laranakar to drive us out of the region. Especially along the Kalavend, a region dominated by Larankarha puppet states, they align with their master against us. One can only assume they would rather live in slavery under one of their own than live free under a foreigner.\n\nHow whipped must a slave be to come to crave the lashing?"

 flavor_ameion.19.t: "[G79.GetName] Supports Mainland Liberty"
 flavor_ameion.19.d: "When we sent the extremists within our own borders to exist within their own autonomy, we intended to let them live by their own ways and leave us to our more worthy affairs. However, it unfortunately is not surprising that they hold sympathies for those not yet in our borders, and have refused to contribute anything to our efforts. There are even growing concerns they will turn tail and side with them in the hopes that throwing enough men at our weapons will let them return to their barbaric ways."

 flavor_ameion.20.t: "Local Saboteurs"
 flavor_ameion.20.d: "If the Taychendi have one advantage over us, it is that they know their own terrain better than we do. The brighter among them have exploited this knowledge to determine weak points in our fortifications, and cover up their own.\n\nOne could say they have learned from us one way or another, for tactics of this quality were unthinkable before our arrival here."

 flavor_ameion.21.d: "Embolded by the on-going fighting, several movements across Taychend have taken the opportunity to rise against us. Fortuntately, this exposure has made it easier for us to stamp them out."

 flavor_ameion.22.d: "[2487.GetName] has fallen to our forces, and its leadership is brought to [G52.Monarch.GetTitle] [G52.Monarch.GetName] to discuss the fate of Taychend. [G64.Monarch.GetTitle] [G64.Monarch.GetName] expects torture, either for [G64.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] or [G64.Monarch.GetHerHis] family members to force [G64.Monarch.GetHerHis] compliance, but we do not partake in [G64.Monarch.GetHerHis] methods. We sit [G64.Monarch.GetHerHim] down, offer [G64.Monarch.GetHerHim] a variety of teas, and bring [G64.Monarch.GetHerHim] a map. On this map, lies the borders of the remaining Taychendi states and where they fall in relation to Ameion.\n\nSome will be made to kneel immediately, but for many this peace is a beneficial one in the short term. Importantly, it removes any semblance of unity across the land, an opening to be filled by us.\n\nThe [G64.Monarch.GetTitle] knows they have no room to negotiate anything to their benefit, so in due time [G64.Monarch.GetSheHe] is sent home to deliver the news to [G64.Monarch.GetHerHis] allies."
 flavor_ameion.22.a: "It is not enough to defeat them, we must show our ways are superior."
 
 flavor_ameion.23.t: "The Delegations Arrive"
 flavor_ameion.23.d: "The Chendhyans, with their swift feline mounts and proximity to Ameion, are the first to arrive for the Summit. Their mounts seem timid in an urban enviornment unfamiliar to these steppe-native animals. The tribal leaders are reminiscent of their mounts, tame but eyeing those unfamiliar to them with suspicion.\n\nOur fellow kheionai arrive next, the [G56.GetAdjective] and [G62.GetAdjective] of our League are the most familiar with Ameion proper, a city much like their own but showing its magnificance and influence in the streets alone.\n\nThe Mteibhar come also by boat, but in smaller river vessels following the river from their lands to ours. They are the most familiar with the style of gathering this Summit invokes, with their own tribes partaking a smaller scale activity within their valley.\n\nThe most distant of our subjects, the Taychendi arrive last, their numerous delegation representing their densly populated lands, but their akwardness betraying their peoples lack of formal diplomacy, while they are used to ancient cities, they are not used to seeing ours in such a well kept condition."
 flavor_ameion.23.a: "The Summit begins..."
 
 flavor_ameion.24.t: "The Chendhyan Delegations"
 flavor_ameion.24.d: "The Chendhyans, wearing pelts crudely refashioned into diplomatic wear, bring gifts of tobacco and gold jewlery to the Summit. Just as they are the swift and fierce in battle, they are quickest to bring their concerns to the table, and do so without hesitation.\n\nMore than anything, they value their freedom, and even now would rather fight to the last than become second class citizens to our rule."
 flavor_ameion.24.a: "We shall reserve their lands for their tribes to prosper."
 flavor_ameion.24.b: "We shall ease their taxes."
 
 flavor_ameion.25.t: "The Kheionai Delegations"
 flavor_ameion.25.d: "The respresentatives of [G56.GetAdjective] and [G62.GetAdjective] are scarcely distinguishable from our own, much to the confusion of the Devandi and Taychendi. To resolve this issue we have color coded our outfits with cloths produced by each of our cities. Likewise, we bestow such cloths to the other delegates, along with preserved foods suitable for voyages or winter storage.\n\nWhile our friends in the Échate League have the fewest complaints, they have taken this opportunity to call attention to the water ways through the 'Sea of Ameion' connecting the Devand to Taychend. We have made many developments in our new lands, but according to the two cities we should give the waters such attention."
 flavor_ameion.25.a: "We shall build new ships to strengthen trade ties."
 flavor_ameion.25.b: "We shall build new ports to facilitate trade."
 
 flavor_ameion.26.t: "The Mteibhar Delegation"
 flavor_ameion.26.d: "The humble Mteibhar have learned much from us, while their woolen clothes are less impressive than our own, it is clear they have made a genuine effort to imitate our own outfits. As a gesture of goodwill they bring incense and small stone statues, the former mistaken for spice by the Taychendi while the later suspected to be too heavy to be carried home by the Chendhyans without wheel or ship.\n\nIn their attempts to learn our ways, they have sought our help in centralizing the assorted tribes of their kin."
 flavor_ameion.26.a: "We shall help them codify common laws."
 flavor_ameion.26.b: "We shall teach them to demonstrate their might."
 
 flavor_ameion.27.t: "The Taychendi Delegation"
 flavor_ameion.27.d: "The Thekvrystana and Yodhanpir come decorated in the extravagant style of their upper caste, with a handful of Klereyen in a peculiar style taking aspects of both their Kheionai and Taychendi heritages. They bring with them spices and teas which many further west go out of their way to acquire, as well as elegant Teffeta cloths.\n\nWhile our investments into Taychend have been wonderous, they claim we should devote more resources to the effort, to ensure every commoner knows the benefits of our rule."
 flavor_ameion.27.a: "We shall send additional personel to oversee development."
 flavor_ameion.27.b: "We shall send additional funding for such efforts."
 
 flavor_ameion.28.t: "The Summit Concludes"
 flavor_ameion.28.d: "After two months of fraternizing, the represenatives return to their homelands, ladden with goods from their counterparts. The city's alcohol reserves may be empty, but groups that once considered each other alien and hostile will remember these days of diplomacy and nights of revelry. Some are even eager to learn our langauge to foster communication between their new found friends.\n\nThe time now turns to work, however. Promises were made to our subjects, and fufilling them will necessiate keeping the goblets empty."
