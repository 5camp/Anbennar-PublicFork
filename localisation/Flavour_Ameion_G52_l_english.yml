 G52_state_city_title: "State for the City"
 G52_state_city_desc: "As we expand eastward and deliver stability to the war-torn peninsula of Taychend, we must also continue to strengthen our powerbase closer to home. The Basobhar near us control plenty of fields ripe for farming, forests teething with lumber, and hills waiting patiently for their ores to be uncovered.\nWe must send forward our own settlers and claim these lands in the name of Ameion."
 G52_approach_mteibhar_title: "Approach the Mteibhar"
 G52_approach_mteibhar_desc: "The Mteibhar gather in their valley peacefully every once and a while to partake in their religious practices. If we were to attend one of these gathers, we can use their banner of peace to conduct diplomacy with their leadership, and lay the groundwork for their incorporation under Ameion like the Taychendi. They will not submit voluntairly, but knowing and respecting their customs will relieve any tensions their subjugation will create."

 G52_city_state_title: "City for the State"
 G52_city_state_desc: "While our strength is comparable, if not greater, than the true kheions from which our ancestors hail, it is known that Ameion is not as glorious a city as the kheions. As we seek to civilize the Taychendi, we must demonstrate the core priciple of Kheionism; the place and power of the city within a civilization."
 G52_approach_chendhyan_title: "Approach the Chendhyan"
 G52_approach_chendhyan_desc: "The feline-riders of the Chendhyan steppes not only partake in barbaric acts of raid and plunder, but they embody them. To them, their freedom must come at the expense of others. If we are to prevent these practices, we must not only understand them, but show them the consequences of their hostilities."
 G52_embrace_humble_title: "Embrace the Humble"
 G52_embrace_humble_desc: "The Devandi value their liberty highly, but as far as the average man is concerned what matters most is their day-to-day life. We may win easy victories over their armies, but what will keep them from rising again shall be how we improve their lives under our rule. There may be glory in raiding, but they shall learn the comforts of a well tended field."
 G52_kheion_past_title: "Kheion Past Alecand"
 G52_kheion_past_desc: "Ameion has grown as a kheion significantly in recent years, fueled by the wealth of Taychend. In many ways it has become superior to the true kheions of the west, and it is time we gain recognition for this. Bringing representatives from Alecand to showcase our mighty capital will prove to them the kheionai lifestyle is attainable even beyond their home island."

 G52_echate_league_title: "The Échate League"
 G52_echate_league_desc: "The nékheis were founded by the kheions over a millenium ago for the twin purposes of finding resources for the kheions, and to create homes for those overcrowding the cities to move to. Our own origins lie in the nékheis, and we have always prefered diplomacy with them, if nothing else due to their proximity.\n\n[G62.GetName] recently found itself without a kheion overlord due to the fall of [G61.GetName], and this gives us an opportunity to create an alliance between the two of us, and the nékhei between us: [G56.GetName]. With our leadership, the Andic Reach could become a new center of power in the Kheionai world: The Échate League."
 G52_establish_borders_title: "Establish Borders"
 G52_establish_borders_desc: "The first matter to settle to ensure the prosperity of the Échate League is to ensure we are on the same page regarding our settling of the Andic Reach. The kheions squabble with each other for the coastline of the Devand, and we must ensure such petty disputes do not fracture us as it has them."
 G52_common_military_title: "Common Military"
 G52_common_military_desc: "Our friends in the Échate League are useful to have as allies, but as Laskaris ruled our city alone they lack the military standards we have come to expect. We shall organize their armies to our standards, and in the process take the opprotunity to cross-reference tactics and mutually develop more effective methods of combat."
 G52_rising_state_title: "A Rising State"
 G52_rising_state_desc: "The Kylakas of the west dream of a unified state; those in Alecand seek to overthrow their peers and unite their island. Our ancestors in Devand dreamed of uniting the nékheis into a united front free from the control of the homeland. Now, we have built our own state, one crossing the barrier between the Kheionai, the Devandi, and the Taychendi.\n\nThere is work to be done before these segments of our society are united, but the foundations have been made for a state primed to rule all of these lands, and to unite them all under one identity."

 G52_first_kneel_desc: "Many have deemed us invaders and conquerers, but those in Korrimutren saw us for what we are: a force of stability seeking to bring peace to these lands. It was they alone who knelt before Laskaris, and they alone who have shared in the rewards, and their city has since known prosperity. We shall teach their leaders the priciples of civilization, and the victories that follow shall show the Taychendi the benefits of aligning with us."
 G52_against_warlords_title: "Against Warlords"
 G52_against_warlords_desc: "As we tame the lands of Laskaris' initial foothold, we see the fruit of our labor begin to manifest already in Korrimutren. There their elite gather in their capital, eager to adopt the ways of the civilized world. It shall be far easier to bring them into the fold when they speak our langauge, and easier to administer them when they view politics through the same lens we do."
 G52_prepare_push_title: "Prepare the Next Push"
 G52_prepare_push_desc: "Carefully coordinated, our march across Taychend is not the chaotic barbarity that the Taychendi are accostomed to. Instead it is a planned course, learning of local defenses and military capabilities of our enemy before we engage them. They may have strength in numbers, but we have strength in capability."
 G52_civilization_taychend_title: "Civilization in Taychend"
 G52_civilization_taychend_desc: "We push ever closer to the [G64.Government.GetName] of [G64.GetName], and it is becoming increasingly obvious the fate of Taychend shall be decided between us. We are reluctant to admit it, but we are not yet prepared to take them on in a head-on battle. However, as we continue to bring peace in our wake, we continue to differentiate ourselves from their tyranny. While they rule over their subjects with an iron first, we shall handle ours with gloves of [G61.GetAdjective] silk."

While our victory was great, all of these states still stand to fight another day, and it is only a matter of time before they join together again in an attempt to drive us out. We must prepare faster than they can, and push our advantage while we still hold it."
 G52_new_conquest_title: "A New Conquest"

 #Events
 flavor_ameion.1.t: "Contemplation upon Vussam"
 flavor_ameion.1.d: "''Many of my men now rest back home, but I sail back across the sea to plan their next steps when they rejoin me. I remember my first voyage across these waters; seeking the city of Nanru Nakar, from which the region's magical trinkets originated. After the hostility of the local warlords forced me to turn back, I learned my fate in Korrimutren.\n\nI would bring Ameioni rule to these lands, replacing their war-torn fields with bountiful farms, and setting the stage for those after me to bring prosperity to their people. \n\nMore interestingly, I learned the exact age and cause of my death, indicating I would survive all else thrown at me.\n\nBoth of these have proved true thus far, but my work continues. I am in a race against a calendar to establish my city's rule here before my passing, and while I may never lay eyes on Nakar myself, I must ensure my descendants do.''\n\n -Journal of Laskaris"

 flavor_ameion.4.t: "Legacy of Laskaris"
 flavor_ameion.4.d: "When Laskaris began preparations for our invasion of Taychend, he recruited the nobility and troops loyal to them by promising land and influence at the expense of the locals. This policy worked for the moment, however some have become concerned about the power this noble class now yields. Now that Laskaris is gone, his successor must decide whether to continue such policies, or re-assert the priciples of the republic."

It becomes clear to [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the Mteibhar will not accept oppressive rule, so therefore the key to establishing Ameioni rule here is for them to be treated as equals. While this tribe may prove a thorn in the side of those uninformed, [G63.GetName] may prove to be a a respectable civilization under our guidance, even if they must be convinced by force."
 flavor_ameion.11.d2: "''I met with [G63.Monarch.GetTitle] [G63.Monarch.GetName] in his domain of [G63.Capital.GetName] in an attempt to show them the benefits of Ameioni rule, but learned of their traditions of independence, and past rebellion against slavery. I have deduced the key to incorporating them is to treat them as equals, and show they have nothing to fear from us. While these tribals may prove a thorn in the side of the nékheis, [G63.GetName] may prove to be a a respectable civilization under our guidance, even if they must unfortunately be convinced by force.\n\nThe incense was quite nice though.''\n\n -Journal of Laskaris"

 flavor_ameion.12.t: "A Trip North"
 flavor_ameion.12.d1: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] ventured north into the Chendhyan steppes with the intention of learning of their customs and guaging interest in benefitting from Ameioni rule. He recieved his answer at the tip of a spear, with him and most of his entourage slaughtered and mauled by their felines.\n\nIt is clear their barbarity shall only be ended by the might of the phalanx, and they will be taught to despise the acts of their ancestors."
 flavor_ameion.12.d2: "''As my entourage and I were crossing a stream, we were set upon by a band of Chendhyans mounted on their cats, seemingly with the intent to kill me for my atrocious act of diplomacy. Unfortunately they seemed to not know who I am, and watched helplessly as I dodged multiple projectiles and cut down several of their mounts.\n\nOne of them, who had more sense than the others, begged my mercy and brought me to [H29.Capital.GetName] and recounted our encounter to his [H29.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nEager for live proof, the [H29.Monarch.GetTitle] shot several arrows at me, which I deflected and doged with east. What did surprise me, however, was that the [H29.Monarch.GetTitle] then knelt before me, pledging his [H29.GovernmentName] to my rule.\n\nThe negotiations proved short, but I doubt the others will kneel so easily.''\n\n -Journal of Laskaris"

Today, the three members of the Échate League: [G62.GetName], [G56.GetName], and of course [G52.GetName] gather to set aside their differences so that they can focus on the growth of their states. The focus on natural borders ensures there will be little room for future conflicts, and signatures between the three [G52.Monarch.GetTitle] seals the fate of the Andic Reach."
