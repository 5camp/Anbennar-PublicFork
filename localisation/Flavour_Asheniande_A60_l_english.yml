 A60_gamblers_paradise_desc:0 "Ravenhill is already home to a large number of gambling houses and other establishments of ill repute, and they generate much income for us.

 A60_rolling_the_dice_title:0 "Rolling the Dice"
 A60_rolling_the_dice_desc:0 "While Ravenhill is a prosperous city in its own right, it tends to have a high crime rate, and also has the problem of the encroaching swamp. We might be able to solve both these problems at once. The debtors are desperate for a way out of their situation. We will consider their debt paid if they go out into the swamp and aid in the resettlement."
 A60_flooded_coast_title:0 "Control the Flooded Coast"
 A60_flooded_coast_desc:0 "Now that we are starting to reclaim the folly for our nation, we should focus first on securing the coastal regions, which contains both the old city of Corveld and the estuary of the Dostanesck River, both of which will be helpful to exerting further control over the swamps."
 A60_folly_reclaimed_title:0 "Folly Reclaimed"

 A60_redistricting_ravenhill_desc:0 "Ravenhill, for centuries, has been a border city on the edge of a dark swamp, filled with less reputable members of society. It had to adapt to its position, and thus the city itself has a strange, lopsided layout and setup. Now, Ravenhill finds itself in a central position, surrounded by newly founded farmland and villages. Due to its considerable size already, it will likely become a major urban hub of the region. And thus, as it had to adapt to the swamp in ages past, it must adapt once more to what it shall become. We will redistrict the city, and hopefully turn it into the shining star of the region. First, we will need to make the city much more attractive to the upper class..."

 A60_eastern_march_desc:0 "Our ambitions in the borders have grown, and we must assert ourselves over Arannen.

 A60_pale_light_of_corvuria_desc:0 "A Powerful piece of propaganda is being spread throughout Asheniande and Corvuria; a play titled "The Pale Light of Corvuria". The play calls for the unification of Corvuria under the House of the Pale Raven, and highlights both the prosperity of Asheniande superimposed on the more dour circumstances Corvuria has found itself in. What is said may or may not be true, but that matters much less than the fact that people are believing it."

We should seek to gain the support of the electors, and perhaps even utilize the other resources available to us..."
 A60_blood_court_title:0 "The Blood Court"
 A60_blood_court_desc:0 "Working alongside vampires is risky business, as there is no official law or organization that controls them, and many are just as liable to collude with you as they are to act in heinous ways that subvert secrecy and order. In order to protect the masquerade as we delve ever deeper into imperial politics, official vampire law must be dictated, and sufficient organization must be created to see that it gets followed. We will create the first international community of vampires... The Blood Court."

 A60_into_lencenor_desc:0 "Our ruler holds the crowns of Arannen, Corvuria, Asheniande, and Anbennar itself in their possession. We shall prepare for our next venture in politics and war, and set our sights on Lencenor, the land of roses and wine.

 A60_ashen_rose_title:0 "The Ashen Rose"
 A60_ashen_rose_desc:0 "We have prepared long enough. It is now time for our march into Lencenor. First, our rule will spread over Roilsard, the origin of our great dynasty.

 A60_rebuild_rivers_title:0 "Rebuild River Trade"
 A60_rebuild_rivers_desc:0 "The Karnvord River has served as the perfect channel of trade into the heart of Corvuria, and along with the smaller rivers around it makes for a perfect system of trade routs across the region.

 #Events
 asheniande.1.t:0 "The Fate of our Country"
 asheniande.1.d:0 "[A60.Monarch.GetName] died last night after falling ill the previous week. The fate of our realm is uncertain, as they died without any children. Only a few have come forward thus far staking their claim, including a supposed cousin of [A60.Monarch.GetName] by the name of Artorian síl Vivin. Already well liked and influential among the aristocracy, his claim is strongest. The vampiric members of our nobility are especially concerned with the outcome of this and what it will mean for vampirekind, as Artorian himself is a powerful vampire. It is unsure if this will be good or bad for the country,  but many are hopeful that this is the start of something greater."
 asheniande.1.a:0 "We shall see where this takes us."

 asheniande.2.t:0 "Unification Sentiment"
 asheniande.2.d:0 "The síl Vivin branch in Asheniande has been sponsoring some propoganda that is spreading throughout our realm that calls for the unification of our two polities under their rule. It is a play called "The Pale Light of Corvuria". The mindset is starting the spread throughout our realm that we are mismanaging things on our end and that the state is incompetent, which just isnt true, but there isn't much we can do to stop it."
 asheniande.2.a:0 "Our people aren't sure what to believe..."


 asheniande.3.t:0 "The Treaty of Gisden"
 asheniande.3.d:0 "Our friend and ally, the Duke of Asheniande has come to us. Our nations both have a rightful claim to the lands that lie between us in Gisden. They are offering to give up their claims on Gisden, if we give up our claims on Quintenbury and Upsfield."

 asheniande.3.a:0 "The lands are rightfuly ours. They get nothing."
 asheniande.3.b:0 "Let them have Upsfield, but Quintenbury is too much."
 asheniande.3.c:0 "Accept their demands."

 asheniande.4.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 asheniande.4.d:0 "Ravenhill has quickly become a city of great importance in our lands, and its central location would be a perfect spot for an administrative capital of our lands. However, Ashfield is more historically important to our nation, and is located along a tributary of the Esmar, which offers its own unique advantages."
 asheniande.4.a:0 "Keep Capital"
 asheniande.4.b:0 "Move Capital to Ravenhill"

 asheniande.5.t:0 "Chaos in the Vampire Community"
 asheniande.5.d:0 "Because the vampires of our realm refused to join and submit to the Blood Court, they have faced the consequences. The Blood Court plotted a hostile takeover of our vampire community instead of a peaceful one. After making contacts amongst our vampire community, all of the pieces fell into place. Their coup involved multiple threats towards the previous leadership, some of which were acted upon. Should we submit to their 'invitation'?"
 asheniande.5.a:0 "Submit to the Blood Court"
 asheniande.5.b:0 "Refuse to Submit"

 asheniande.6.t:0 "Failure"
 asheniande.6.d:0 "Our mission to convince the vampire community of [From.GetName] to join the Blood Court has failed, and they shall contnue to remain independent from international vampire law, a problem that must be amended."
 asheniande.6.a:0 "Ashen Skies!"

 asheniande.7.t:0 "A New Member"
 asheniande.7.d:0 "Either willingly or unwillingly, the vampire caste in [From.GetName] has joined the Blood Court and will now act on our orders." # What shall their task be? The Vampires of [From.GetName] can either weaken it from within to make sure that the land is ripe for us to occupy, or spread our influence in their realm to bring our two nations closer together.
 asheniande.7.a:0 "The Vampires of [From.GetName] will spread our influence."
 #asheniande.7.b:0 "The Vampires of [From.GetName] will weaken it from within."

 asheniande.8.t:0 "Fate of our Emigres"
 asheniande.8.d:0 "The Emigres we sent out a few weeks ago have ended up in [emigres_landing.GetName], where they will begin to grow in power and hopefully help increase our influence."
 asheniande.8.a:0 "An Interesting Development..."

 asheniande.9.t:0 "Thriving Community"
