flavour_hierarchy.1.title:0 "The Source of Blood"
flavour_hierarchy.1.desc:0 "There is blood on Supreme Hierarch [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s hands. This time, though, it’s merely from a papercut. After decades of war and conquest, the core borders of the Hierarchy have been restored; for now, Lorent is satisfied, Gawed is not on the offensive, and the kobolds remain subdued. All of this is to say that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has time to do administrative paperwork rather than plan for another campaign. And yet, despite it all, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] is bleeding. There is still blood on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands.\n\nThe Cliff Gnomes were always different from their kin. Their artificers cared more for weapons of war than automated butlers; their armies spent more time drilling than reading; their schools studied logistics and tactics more than philosophy and logic. The rest of the Hierarchy looked down on the Cliff Gnomes for their warrior spirit, but where is the rest of the Hierarchy now? They are dead, with their descendants either extinct or only returning to the Dragoncoast because of Nimscodd’s army. It was the resilience of the Cliff Gnomes that now re-establishes the empire that all had thought lost.\n\nAs the Hierarchy takes shape, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a choice to make. The Dragoncoast is devastated, but its enemies continue to loom. To embrace the ethic of the Hierarchy fully is to embrace industry, innovation, philosophy, logic, and every other soft discipline under the sun. Doing so would help repopulate the coast, reconstitute its cities, and feed its citizens. It would create prosperity where, for so long, there has been none.\n\nBut to embrace the plowshare is to abandon the sword. Every ounce of administrative effort dedicated to development is an ounce of effort not used to ready the army. Every artificer developing enhanced methods of paper production is an artificer that could have been producing cannons. Is [Root.Monarch.GetName] willing to begin an age of prosperity, if it means the Hierarchy may be unprepared for an invasion from Lorent or Gawed? Will the blood on [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s hands be from paper, or the sword?"
flavour_hierarchy.1.a:0 "A Supreme Hierarch should only have blood on their hands if it comes from a papercut!"
flavour_hierarchy.1.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will not sacrifice the Cliff Gnomes' martial character!"

flavour_hierarchy.2.title:0 "The Metal or the Music"
flavour_hierarchy.2.desc:0 "Two crowns sit before Hierarch [Root.Monarch.GetName]. To [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] left is regalia made of aluminium, the rarest metal in our nation and the material most-prized by our artificers. It gleams with wealth and value, representing all the glorious industry for which the Hierarchy was once famous. To [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] right, on the other hand, is a simple prop crown. It was taken haphazardly from the River Gnome Comedic Theatre.\n\nThe Creek Gnomes have known two nations, while most gnomes have known only known one. Certainly, those of the Creek remember the Hierarchy fondly: fondly enough to reconquer its land, redevelop its borders, destroy its enemies, and coronate themselves as its successor. The Gnomish Hierarchy is the synecdoche for all gnomish innovation, technology, artificery, and development. It was efficient, rich, powerful, and intelligent. It represented everything that gnomes could do.\n\nBut the Hierarchy was not immortal, and when it fell, the Creek Gnomes managed to use their crafty diplomacy to start a new country. The Kingdom of Iochand began with a prop crown much like the one currently on the Hierarch’s right, and emphasized the jesters, multiculturalism, theatre, and capriciousness that still defines the Creek today. Through characteristic whimsy, the Creek was able to survive when the Hierarchy was not. Portsnamm, despite its now-grand army, remains a city of performers at its core.\n\nCertainly, Iochand will be left in the past. It was always a stepping-stone on the path to recovering the Hierarchy. But on the day of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] coronation, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a decision to make. Will [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s empire be one of metal, or of music? Will [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] crown be purely of the Hierarchy, or will it retain the character of the Creek?"
flavour_hierarchy.2.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] takes the aluminium crown. The Gnomes will rise through industry."
flavour_hierarchy.2.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] takes the prop crown. Diplomacy and jest make the world go round!"
