Alas, their cause failed as Pelodan was slain by the heretics, as the enemies of the Eordellon rallied behind the restors of Arakeprun.

 drisleak_hold_billel_desc:0 "For uncounted years the Dukad of Dearktir has held claim to the island of Billel, although it was deemed hardly worth it to administer the near-barren island. In 1432 Carodir Strongarm made efforts to populate and fortify the island, also implementing strict trade laws forcing merchants en route to Murdkather to pay fees. Murdkather understandably is threatened by this and seeks to end our hold over Billel and the trade fees: we must continue Carodir's efforts and erect a mighty fortress to protect our interests."

Founded in ages long shrouded, Bagcatir broke free from a polity that Dearktir claims its roots from, the ancient tyrant state Drisleak. Now they come to us again demanding servitude based on dusty ancient claims. If we are to remain free from Dearktir, Pelomar, or any other that threatens our city, we must uphold our republican virtues that have made our city strong, and trust in our Comhair to make true and strong decisions for us all."

A thorn in the side of Murdkather, the island of Billel owned by Dearktir forces traders entering the port to pay entry fees. In this great competition we must remain wary and ready for any situation, for at any moment the scales might be in our favor.

On the far eastern shores of the Elarbarc near the border of Murdkather a small colony has settled, sponsored by an eccentric coalition of merchants. They claim that the native Fograc people, long thought traitors to the Eordellon faith as a whole, are more welcoming and receptive of our colonies than was previously thought. Now that relative stability has been brought to the region, many Caamasi have thought to venturing into these lands, and possibly settling there.

While there is a lack of domestic iron, the sources of copper in Eordand are firmly held by our Tuathak brethren: it has made our legions strong and our pockets heavy. The lords of Sglard have even named themselves Copperheart, doubtless after their hold on the copper supply.

This beauty is marred by the scorches of warfare and the defilement of invaders; by necessity we must protect our forests and lands.

While our armies besieged their fortresses, their elite warriors the "Sea-Serpents" snuck by and struck at our stronghold of Fuglborg. Our city sacked, Bjarnrik's armies withdrew to deal with this invasion of their homeland only to find the Sea-Serpents had disappeared into the marsh as quickly as they appeared.

Our old enemies of Serpentgard saw their southern borderlands of Deland and Mawdock seized, and soon their lords bowed before the Celmaldorian Princes.

 eord_5_beyond_mountains_desc:0 "The value of the Armonadh is not only beneath its surface, but also in what lies beyond it. In ages past these mountains held an ancient civilization of Ruinborn, now abandoned as the Precursor ruins. From the mountain peaks one can see a vast plain beyond, bisected by a great river and studded with countless towns. The Armonadhi are a gate to this new realm and the beginning of the restoration of greater Aelantir!"

 eord_5_lands_unbridled_winter_desc:0 "Far to the north beyond the Randrunnse where no Snecboth has gone, or has returned alive, the Toreifar is aptly named. Massive glaciers empty massive icebergs into the churning sea, and open channels of water often are shortlived before they are filled once again with ice. Survival in these lands is tough, where in the farthest reaches trees refuse to grow and all remains buried in snow. And even the hardiest must contest with the Ice Sleepers who stalk and drag us into the depths of the sea. But even these inhospitable lands must be secured, for they guard the only passage in the north of Aelantir."
 eord_5_establish_winter_city_title:0 "Establish Eighpekann"
 eord_5_establish_winter_city_desc:0 "There are few places that could be described as pleasant on the shores of the Toreifar, even for the most devout of the Winter Court. But where a great spear of land juts into the sea, a protected harbor with a small river retains enough warmth to harbor some sparse forests. There are stark few places that one can dock within the Toreifar, with the rapid current and frigid waters freezing. But here a small haven may be established, where Eordan may rest on their voyages across this dangerous sea."
 eord_5_repair_broken_sea_title:0 "Repair the Toreifar"
 eord_5_repair_broken_sea_desc:0 "Light pierces through the darkness from the spires of Eighpekann, revealing the treacherous icebergs and protecting our vessels. The Toreifar is somewhat tamed now, but we must be wary that our enemies will abuse our efforts. Eordand will never be safe until they cannot sail to our shores. Whether borne on the waves or on the glaciated coast, the Toreifar will become a gauntlet of death for our enemies, forcing our enemy to endure both our attacks and the incessant barrage of the sea and cold of winter."
 eord_5_fractured_chivalry_title:0 "Fractured Chivalry"
 eord_5_fractured_chivalry_desc:0 "The Dolindhan plains have fostered a strong martial tradition of honor and loyalty, home to many chivalric knights astride horned mounts. But despite their oaths of loyalty, they are fractured in their allegiances between each hill and riverbank. Where once a great empire united the river Ynn, only decayed cities and competing nobles remain. They have incessantly fought to hold back their age-old enemies of the dragon-fearing Rzentur, endured against the savage Cursed Ones, and moreso than all else fought amongst each other. Their fighting spirit is admirable if misplaced, but their chivalry will be better served serving us!"

 eordspring_5_gardens_grebniesth_desc:0 "An oasis of beauty in this stark northern landscape, the Gardens of Grebniesth have long been a point of pride for the Dolindhan nobility. Nurturing a plethora of flowers and their great hedge maze has been no easy task in this cold climate, but they have had many years of experience. Their skill is greatly admirable to us, for they have the potential to be apprentices of us. With the channeling of Spring's growth, what wonders could be grown at this home away from home?"
 eordsummer_5_sunken_city_title:0 "The Sunken City"
 eordsummer_5_sunken_city_desc:0 "The river Ynn has been the lifeblood of the Ynnic civilization, but it has also brought it great peril. Floods can be devastating, destroying cities in their wake and depositing the rubble far downstream. In their folly, the Dolindhans attempted to remedy this by constructing a series of dams to control the river. Vareped, one of the greatest cities of the northern Ynn, was drowned beneath the resulting lake behind the dam as water began to accumulate behind it. What remains is now known as Mocvare. What has been drowned has not been recovered since this tragedy, but for those adherents of Summer diving beneath the surface will be simple task."

 eordautumn_5_reclaim_dracball_desc:0 "Wreathed in lightning and red the color of blood, the legendary blade Dracball has been lost since it was stolen by it's creator and taken east beyond the Armonadhi Mountains. It's location has been unknown, until now that we have encroached into the Ynn valley. The lords of Arganjuzorn have claimed ownership of it, slaying the dragon-lord Drozmagog. The rightful place of the sword is in our hands - Arganjuzorn will fall, and they will submit it back or face excruciating death!"

 eordwinter_5_winters_clemency_desc:0 "North of the Svemel, the original lands of the Rzentur are still dwelled by their unfortunate brethren, who lack our connection to Winter. Their lives are miserable and short, unbefitting of the true potential that Winter offers. It is our duty to approach them and assist them, not just as upholding our Precursor legacy, but as a matter of principle. While our enemies may perish in the frigid winter, our friends or those undeserving must be granted a chance to find reprievement from pain and a chance at joy."

 eordellon_5_antlered_king_desc:0 "An ancient forest amongst the rolling plains of the Ynn, the Drevonsred forest may remind us of the Domandrod were it not for something offputting. The local Dolindhans raise and ride the mighty horned beasts hailing from this forest, and do not seem as perturbed as we are. Amatrvo towers over the forest, a gargantuan tree so large that they have carved a palace within its trunk. The tree is magical surely, but not as we are familiar. The fear of the unknown is offputting... but tempting."
 eord_5_remove_curse_title:0 "Remove Curse"
 eord_5_remove_curse_desc:0 "Beyond the civilized lands lapping the Ynn is the Forest of the Cursed Ones, aptly named. Not as magical as the Domandrod, but infested with aggressive and strong humanoids unlike the other Ruinborn we have encountered. Few have been approachable, most resorting to war upon noticing us. What the identity of their curse is, and where it originated, is unknown to us, but they dwell where the winds pass over the wasted lands of Dalaire. Once a great kingdom of the Precursor Empire, little remains of it, mostly buried with thick ice. Our scholars and expeditionaries clamor to study it: for this, we must secure them passage through the Cursed land."
 eord_5_winds_magic_title:0 "Winds of Magic"

There are still inhabitable lands north of where Dalaire was situated, constantly buffeted by magical winds from the great glaciated plateau. So close to such a great site of power has excited our mages, eager to explore this land. But so too are others drawn to the cold wasteland and the milder lands, drawn by both lures of Precursor riches and the rumors of gold in the mountains. We cannot afford to let an expedition set forth while we cannot guarantee their safety against rival bands: the borders of Dalaire must be secured for a forward camp."

Progress has been slow, with every expedition sent forward being beset by all manner of dangers. But where the cursed ice meets the sea, there may be a safe place to set up camp. Our scouts have reported that here they can communicate with our camp at the edge of the glacier, speculating that they can create a magical map of what lies ahead. They also have advised this site because it seems to be clear of the headaches and abberant thoughts that accumulate when traveling the wastes..."

It is time to risk it all: we will descend the cliffwalls with a series of lifts and bring the fight to them! The backwoods around the cliffwalls may hide our armies, but they will not hide the massive lift structures. Should we take the cliffbase, we can be certain that our march to the Trollsbay will be swift. There is no turning back, we will reclaim Aelantir or not at all!"

 eord_5_mouth_ynn_desc:0 "Our journey from the headwaters of the Ynn have brought us to the mouth of the Ynn. Countless leagues, countless wars and deaths. All in the name of restoring the Precursor Empire of old! After many years, seeing the mouth of the Ynn so close has brought back morale once thought lost. An end to our wars is near!\n\nBut like how the waters of the river do not stop flowing when draining into the ocean, so to will our journey and harships never end. The colonial enterprises of the Trollsbay and beyond are too far entrenched. We can dominate their trade patterns, but not remove it. And for as long as they have interests in our lands, they will be back."

 eord_5_bay_false_trolls_desc:0 "A gross misnomer, the Trollsbay truly does not resemble or even contain Trolls! Truly the colonists are most confused, or they cannot see as well as us. Nevertheless, the Trollsbay is ripe for our reconquest following the seizure of the Ynnsmouth. Their colonies are disunited and well-spaced apart, lacking any real subsistence. It will be simple to defeat them should they be unable to receive imports."

There are countless Cannorians, be they humans, elves, dwarves, or other races that we must oversea, each then further split into national and cultural loyalties. An incredible headache, even worse than when the Jhorgashirrans tried to oversee the Esmari fur traders. But if we can manage this mess, we can make it malleable into a new system: they need not rely on their homeland, but see us as their partners!"

 eord_5_bloody_glades_desc:0 "Stained red as if the trunks themselves were bleeding, the Bloodgroves are a grim reminder of the blood spilt to reach where we are - and what is to come. Like the Trollsbay, the Bloodgroves have been well situated for dominance by the Cannorians. Few of the native Kwineh are left, to our shame, expelled or exterminated by the callous Star Elves of Aelnar and their conflict with the Sornic Sons who dared defend the Ruinborn. It is unavoidable - to fend off the Cannorian aggression and protect Aelantir forever, there is need for more war and more blood spilt. At least the Bloodgroves will mask the death all around us."

You have made all admit defeat before the very incarnation of Aelantir transcendent, toppled great empires for the rebirth of the Precursor Empire itself! What were once seen as lost and stunted children have proven to the world that the Ruinborn are more than deserving of glory and greatness - with the Eordan who spearheaded this movement highest upon the pedestal! But do not rest upon your laurels, for there is always room for the mighty to fall. The Cannorian Empires still hover around like vultures, watching for weakness and for us to fall into folly like the Precursors before us. Eordand will insure that this fate will never await Aelantir again - whether it be in service to the Fey Lords, or through awakening the lost knowledge of the Precursors, Aelantir is truly Reborn!"

Many were lost in the conflicts between the Tuathak and Peitar, but the birthplace of the Golden Acres has not: deep within the Domandrod, the primeval golden trees entrance the Tuathak like never seen before. And before even a doubt of boredom enters their minds, the glade has always promised the glory of a great hunt!"

But there are moments of brightness in this dark season, for when all come together in support of each other the season becomes one of joy and celebration. Playing in the soft snow, racing on sleds, and enjoying warming meals by the fireplace are fond memories of even the most stone-hearted Tuathak. In the frozen glades blessed with Winter, these warm feelings persist yearlong, a paradise of comfort where one could stay forever."
