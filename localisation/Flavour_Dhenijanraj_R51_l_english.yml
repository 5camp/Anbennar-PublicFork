 R51_subdue_the_south_desc:0 "The Mercantile cities of the Gulf of Rahen have long defied the Lotus Throne. From the time when their alliance slew Ramapalar II at the Bloody Gate of Shenral in 1333, the quarreling cities of the South have always managed to present a united front against our attempts to subdue them. The many indecisive wars we have fought with them in the past century end now - from Davharral to Sardika, the Coast shall kneel to the Raja."

 R51_dockyards_of_southern_rahen_desc:0 "The Raj has been without a royal navy since the Great Slave Revolt of 1355 AA, when the Tiger Fleet was burned and the harbor of Sramaya was lost to us. Those few ships that sail from the ports of Rabaghekhur and Tujgal will never suffice to challenge the Bhuvaurite navy, and so we must build an armada of our own if we are ever to reclaim the Delta. The dockyards of the recently conquered southern ports shall be put to work building us mighty warships to dominate the waters of the Gulf of Rahen, and with this new fleet we will end the humiliation of this 100-year slave rebellion.

 R51_retake_kharunyana_delta_desc:0 "Born out of the Great Slave Revolt of 1355, the Republic of Bhuvauri is the greatest symbol of the Raj’s impotence - Shurapalar the Radiant could not reconquer the land with deft generalship and pragmatism, nor could Amanapurna I the Bloody subdue it with ruthlessness and slaughter. Even Amanapurna II the Peacemaker could not bring the slave-lords back into the Raj with diplomacy and an open paw. No, the Slaves-turned-slavers have retained their independence and dominated the Delta for a century, triumphant over our armies an embarrassing number of times - but that embarrassment shall end now. The Raj is no longer weak, and we will prove it once and for all by reclaiming the Kharunyana Delta from the Bhuvauri."

 R51_end_bhuvauri_republic_desc:0 "Sramaya, the Pearl of Rahen, is finally ours, and all of the eastern Kharunyana delta has fallen before our conquering armies. Despite the crushing defeat that we have dealt the Bhuvauri, however, we cannot rest upon our laurels. The history of the Harimraj is filled with overconfident leaders brought low by their own complaceny, and we may yet be undone if we do not press the advantage. It is time to tear down the Bronze Dragon’s Flag - we must cross into Bomdan and end the last remnants of the Republic of Bhuvauri that persist there."

 R51_expand_raheni_slave_plantations_title:0 "Expand Slave Plantations"
 R51_expand_raheni_slave_plantations_desc:0 "Slavery has been an integral part of the economy of southern Rahen for thousands of years. Silk and cotton plantations are worked by prisoners of war, debt slaves, and Sarhali captives alike, their forced labor providing the backbone of these dominant industries. The great influx of slaves taken in the Kharunyana campaign has the potential to reinvigorate the southern economy - let us put the Bhuvauri back where they belong, toiling for the glory of the Raja."

 R51_raj_cannorian_relations_title:0 "Cannorian Relations"
 R51_raj_cannorian_relations_desc:0 "The recent arrival of Cannorian merchants and mercenaries has begun to alter the balance of power in Haless. Until now, Cannor was little more than a distant dream for most Raheni - a place so far away on the map that only the most fantastical tales about its strange cultures traveled down the Golden Highway to reach us. Now, however, elven-blooded traders and half-orc mercenaries are a common site in the markets of the East, many of them sponsored by wealthy Cannorian kingdoms. Perhaps it is time to establish formal relations with the great powers to the West, ensuring that the diplomatic and mercantile treaties that will no doubt be established in the near future are made in our favor."

 R51_raj_cannorian_armaments_desc:0 "While gunpowder has been known in Haless for centuries, it was seen in Rahen as little more than a dwarven oddity until 16th century advances in metallurgy allowed for cannons to be deployed in large numbers, changing siege warfare forever. The Cannorian armies and warships that have come to the shores of the east have brought with them new designs for arquebuses and cannons that improve upon those that we have crafted - studying these weapons will allow us to improve our military technology and ensure we do not fall behind the Cannorians."

 R51_raj_of_gods_and_gears_title:0 "Of Gods and Gears"
 R51_raj_of_gods_and_gears_desc:0 "Among their many specialities and skills, artifice is the Cannorian expertise that many in the Harimraj find most intriguing and worrying. To make magic controlled, repeatable, and accessible to all is a worthy goal, but the Cannorian artificers are overwhelmingly convinced that the High Temples, holiest of holy ground, are the key to the extension of their art. They have approached the Lotus Throne repeatedly for permission to lead expeditions into the High Temples, to remove holy relics from their halls for study, and to open doors that were sealed by the High Gods themselves. Such blasphemies cannot be permitted - but perhaps we can allow limited studies of the temples, under our supervision, if these enterprising artificers will share some of their knowledge with us."

 R51_reign_in_vizier_title:0 "Reign in Vizier Power"
 R51_reign_in_vizier_desc:0 "The Grand Vizierate of the Harimraj originated during the minority of Shurapalar I the Radiant, when a strong hand was needed to direct the ship of state and prevent the dissolution of the Raj. The man who stepped into this role, Goshar Goldenpaw, guided Rahen for nearly 25 years as prime minister and principal advisor to a young and inexperienced Raja. While Goldenpaw worked to stabilize and preserve the Raj, the Viziers who succeeded him became increasingly corrupt and self-serving individuals, and the position has long since been a liability to the security of the state. The independence and ambition of the Vizierate must be crushed, and the Foremost Servant of the Raja reminded that they are still only the first among servants."

 R51_authority_lotus_throne_desc:0 "While immediate collapse may have been staved off and the Vizier put back in their place, the Raja is still far from the all-powerful ruler that they are sometimes viewed as by their subjects. Though their most corrupt tendencies have been dealt with, the ministries still hold immense power, many former crownlands have been delegated away to vassals, and the privileges granted to the castes over the past two centuries have chipped away at the supreme authority of the Lotus Throne. It is time to begin recentralizing our power and majesty, such that we are not only the master of Rahen in name, but in fact."

 R51_reconstruct_golden_highway_title:0 "The Golden Highway"
 R51_reconstruct_golden_highway_desc:0 "The Jaherian Epoch is not a period of time that many Raheni recall with fondness - Sun Elven domination, disrespect for the caste system and the High Gods, and the endless megalomaniacal ambitions of an unaging conqueror do not a happy populace make. It is impossible to deny, however, that some of the projects instituted by the Sun Elves improved life in Rahen, and the most visible symbol of their contribution to the subcontinent is the Golden Highway. Running from Davharral to Sarisung, the highway is second only to the Kharunyana River as an artery for commerce to flow, but years of neglect have left parts of it in major disrepair. Repairing the highway would not only be good for trade but also solidify the legitimacy and prestige of the Lotus Throne - let us undertake this task."

 R51_across_far_salahad_title:0 "Across the Far Salahad"
 R51_across_far_salahad_desc:0 "The Golden Highway was an ambitious project - a single road that could cross the breadth of Halcann, from Brasan in the West to Tianlou in the East. To span this distance, the Highway crossed one of the greatest barriers to movement that exists in our world - the Endless Sands of the Far Salahad. In doing so, the links between Bulwar and Rahen were strengthened as trade and diplomacy between the regions blossomed. As we look outwards once again, it would be good to remember the many successes of that time and forge new bonds of wealth and knowledge with the Phoenix Akalates of Bulwar. "

 R51_conquer_the_colonies_title:0 "Conquer the Colonies"
 R51_conquer_the_colonies_desc:0 "Over the past few centuries, the merchant kingdoms of Iyarashar, Davharral, and Sarkashabid became heavily involved not only in trading with the Sarhali lands across the Gulf of Rahen, but also establishing settlements around their existing trading posts.The great wealth in spices and slaves that they drew from the colonies established in the shadow of the Empire of Melekafar was the major reason that these city states were able to rebuff the advance of the Raj. Now that their parent cities have been absorbed into our empire, however, the colonies are defenseless, their wealth ripe for the picking. Let us cross the Gulf of Rahen are reassert Raheni dominance over the far coast. "

 R51_peridot_king_title:0 "The Peridot King"
 R51_peridot_king_desc:0 "The Exilarch of Grozumdihr has ruled a kingdom within our kingdom for nearly two thousand years, the entire Peridot Dwarven community turning to his palanquin in Rayavashapal for guidance instead of heeding the words of the Lotus Throne in Dhenijansar. As centralization is cemented in Rahen once more, the existence of an entire people who live their lives outside of the caste system and listen to an authority other than our court has become insufferable. The dwarves have always been a reasonable people and have long stood side by side with human and harimari, however - perhaps a direct confrontation with the Exilarch can be avoided with diplomacy, and an agreement about our relationship reached?"

 R51_dwarves_in_castes_title:0 "Out-caste no longer"
 R51_dwarves_in_castes_desc:0 "The Caste System in Rahen is ancient, and stretches back to the dawn of the Nadimraj or before, but the dwarves who call this land their home have never fully integrated into the castes. Despite losing their original homeland and thousands of years of coexistence alongside the system, the dwarven clans have continued to defy the caste conventions that define Raheni society. While such a situation has been acceptable in the past, we have increasingly come to see that a parallel society existing within ours is problematic for royal power. With the Peridot King no longer presenting opposition to our moves, it is time to finally see the Dwarven Clans integrated into the caste system for the sake of broader societal harmony."

 R51_temples_of_south_desc:0 "The High Temples are the holiest artifacts of the High Gods, but the inexorable march of the centuries has a way of damaging even that which was wrought by divine will. Where water and wind have not worn away the stones, mortal hands have blasphemed instead, looting these holy places of their treasures or bringing the ruin of fire and war to them. Though the temples that we have stewarded over the years are of course kept in pristine condition and properly respected, many temples have come under our direct administration over the years. We must repair all of the ravages of time that have come upon  the High Temples here in the south, undoing the damage that our internecine struggles have wrought upon them in the years past. "

 R51_library_ghundagar_title:0 "Royal Library of Ghundagar"
 R51_library_ghundagar_desc:0 "During the first Harimraj, Vinas III the Enlightened founded an innocuous archive of royal records just outside of Sardiphadin. This collection would grow over the years, becoming a vast repository of scrolls of all types. The town that sprang up around the Royal Library at Ghundagar would soon become a major center of learning, the largest in Southern Rahen, and the Rajas the followed Vinas kept their personal collections in Ghundagar. Although civil war destroyed much of the great library in 465 AA, parts of the original structure and collection are still maintained there to this day. We should rebuild this once great center of learning and follow in the footsteps of the Rajas of old, consolidating scholarship around what will again be the greatest library in Rahen."

 R51_last_fortress_war_desc:0 "The River-Sea Kharunyana is the border that separates Rahen from Bomdan, and both sides of this languid watercourse are lined with imposing stone walls and great earthworks. These fortresses have stood in one form or another since the late 600s BA, when a series of conflicts between the Rahenraj and an alliance of Bom kingdoms ended in stalemate after decades of devastation. Since then, territorial conquest across the River has been rare, with states mostly confined to one bank of the Kharunyana. Having supplanted the Republic of Bhuvauri completely, however, we are in control of the whole of the Kharunyana delta, and have the chance to drive deep into the heart of Bomdan. It is time to tear down the walls of Bomdan, and conclude one final War of the Fortresses. "

 R51_rahenize_bomdan_desc:0 "The Claw and Lotus banner flies over every castle and city from Sramaya to Lapnam Amrik, but our control over the jungles and rivers of the east is far from absolute. Though the people of Bomdan are adherents of High Philosophy, it is a land largely unaccustomed to the caste system, Harimari administration, and ministerial regulation that defines Rahen. Enforcing our laws with force will likely lead only to resentment - but if we ensure that the lives of the Bom who live within the Harimraj are peaceful and prosperous, they will take the changes we make to their daily lives in stride."

 R51_restore_bim_lau_title:0 "Restore Bim Lau"
 R51_restore_bim_lau_desc:0 "Chief among the cities of Bomdan is Bim Lau, Temple-City of Spirits and Tombs. In times past, it is said that a garrison of deceased warriors defended Bim Lau’s walls, called forth as spirits from the great Necropolis when the city was in need of protection. Now the walls are patrolled by our soldiers and the mausoleum complex is silent as the grave, but the populace of the city still dreams of the long-lost days of their glory.\n\nWhile we can certainly entertain no sepratist sentiment, Bim Lau is a glorious city and a fitting secondary capital. If we were to repair the damage done to the necropolis and its associated temples over the years, we would certainly ingratiate ourselves to the Bom people and secure a stable power base... and who knows? Perhaps we will learn more of the truth of these spirit guardians of legend."

 R51_bloom_lotus_court_title:0 "Bloom of the Lotus Court"
 R51_bloom_lotus_court_desc:0 "The story of the court of Dhenijansar has been one of corruption and decay for decades. The flower of the Raj has wilted in the face of civil war, provincial mismanagement, and opulent decadence. Today, we are little more than a husk of our former glory. We need drastic and far reaching reforms to the governing apparatus of the Raj if we are to avoid total collapse. We walk a narrow path now, a yawning chasm of destruction on both sides, but with the favor of the high gods and the wisdom of the philosophers of old, the flower of the Lotus Court may bloom once more."

 R51_matter_of_suhan_title:0 "The Matter of Suhan"
 R51_matter_of_suhan_desc:0 "High Philosophy is a many-faceted religion that is centered around questioning and debate as we all seek to follow the truest path of the high gods. This tolerance of differing ideas has made the faith remarkably resilient to schism in the past - but it appears that the reforming actions of one man may tear the religious unity of Haless asunder. Guru Suhan’s Praxis, which attempts to synthesize all possible viewpoints into one ideology and questions previously unassailable aspects of Raheni society such as the Caste System, is a worldshaking change to the theological undercurrent of Haless. Suhan’s followers are extreme, and they brook no compromise - either we can join their attempts to synthesize the many Philosophies into one, or stamp out their heresy utterly. Either way, this is but one more challenge to the central authority of the Raja that we must overcome."

 R51_enforce_prahbia_loyalty_desc:0  "Despite our recent efforts at centralization and direct administration, much of our vast empire is still administered by the Prahbia, the hereditary lords in charge of those lands not directly threatened with foreign aggression. The Prahbia govern the primary tax base of our realm, and as such the figurative and literal fortunes of the Raja are tied to good relations and loyalty among the Prahbia. We must cultivate the respect and favor of our subjects - Acknowledging the important work that they do for us, after all, is the best way to ensure that they continue to perform their duties."

 R51_senaptia_banners_title:0 "Banners of the Senaptia"
 R51_senaptia_banners_desc:0 "The Senaptia have been the sharp claws of the Raja since the era of the first Harimraj, when the greatest generals of the age were given custodianship of the wild borderlands and an order to safeguard the inner plains of Harimar’s Empire. Though which realms have been granted the Warlord’s Banner have changed over the millenia, the tradition remains a critical part of our military strength. The many threats on our borders, however, have done great damage to the forces under the Senaptia’s control, and some states that were formerly in charge of the defense of the realm are little more than fragments of their former strength. We must invest in the Senaptia and ensure that they are capable of fielding strong armies to serve as the shield of the Harimraj."

 R51_raja_personal_estate_title:0 "Personal Estate of the Raja"
 R51_raja_personal_estate_desc:0 "The Personal Estate of the Raja once stretched over the majority of the Dhenbasana plain and into Dhujat, the land administered directly by Royal authorities instead of intermediary prahbi. Starting during the reign of Golpalar I, however, the lands of the realm were peeled off and granted to vassals to ease administrative burden and enrich the royal coffers, and the crownlands of the Raja only continued to diminish during the reigns of his successors.\n\nWhile the Prahbia and Senaptia are a vital part of our realm, how can they truly respect us if we hold so little land personally? How can we prevent uprisings from disloyal and traitorous vassals without direct control of the wealth and manpower of the subcontinent? The royal estate must be expanded, either through conquest of the enemies on our borders or annexation of the lesser Prahbia, and the lands we hold enriched. In this we will ensure that the throne is never again powerless to act without the assent of our subjects."

 R51_harimraj_royal_army_title:0 "Royal Army of the Harimraj"
 R51_harimraj_royal_army_desc:0 "When the Harimari first emerged from the jungles of the Ascension Peninsula and began their conquest of Haless, they did so as an unstoppable tide that rolled over ever petty kingdom from the Paravimvhata Mountains to Tianlou. But this great army, the Sashtabari, was not composed of only harimari - it integrated each people that Harimar conquered, bringing their unique skills to bear against the next kingdom he marched against. Ghankedkhen horsemanship, Ghavaanaj War Elephants, the heavy infantry of Shamakhad - all these and more were taken as they were and combined into an incredible fighting force.\n\nThe power of combined arms is not a lesson that we of the second Harimraj have forgotten. Ramapalar the Reunifier’s conquests were due in no small part to his exceptionally loyal Pasindeshi human cavalry contingents, and we have long integrated harimari vanguards with human skirmishers. Despite this, our forces have always been but a fraction of the numbers once fielded by the First Harimraj. It is time to create a new Sashtabari that will rival the old, drawing from the many peoples of Rahen to create a vast new fighting force directly loyal to the Raja."

 R51_united_stable_society_desc:0 "Civilization in Rahen is ancient and slow to change. Such is the weight of customs and traditions in the subcontinent that some scholars have argued that whole centuries could be indistinguishable from each other at first glance. While such statements are clearly an exaggeration, there is no doubt that a strong conservative bent governs the court of the Raja and the popular conscience of the people.\n\nDespite this, the past years have seen major sweeping changes made to the makeup of the Harimraj - new peoples, ideas, religions, and political entities have arisen and expanded and become a part of the fabric of our civilization. Such changes have done much to shake the foundations of the Lotus Throne, but we have overcome and emerged stronger for it. Ours is a United and Stable Society, diverse and dynamic and loyal to the Raja. Let us show the world our unity. "

 R51_golden_palace_title:0 "Renovate the Golden Palace"
 R51_golden_palace_desc:0 "The Golden Palace of Dhenijansar has been a symbol of harimari rule over the subcontinent for hundreds of years. The monumental building began construction during the reign of Harimar’s Heir, Manava of the Divine-Call. A strict Harimari supremacist, Emperor Manava believed that the bickering and petty lords of Rahen would only remain subservient to the Lotus Throne if they were overawed by its splendor, and so he set out to create a palace that would be a physical symbol of his unimpeachable authority.\n\nThe structure took 76 years to complete, but when Manava’s successors laid the final stone, The Golden Palace was the finest construction built in Haless since the time of the High Gods. Since then, the palace has been damaged by fire, earthquakes, palace coups and rebellion, with several wings sitting fully unoccupied. It is time to restore it to its rightful glory, and envelope the Lotus Throne in the Majesty of Gold once more. "

 R51_centralize_rahen_title:0 "Centralization of Rahen"
 R51_centralize_rahen_desc:0 "The perpetual outwards expansion of the harimraj has brought countless new peoples and places within the domain of our empire, but this has created its own slew of problems. Control of these outlying regions is often best handled directly by the army, while prahbi far from the borderlands grow complacent and their roles redundant. With the increasingly centralized state and efficient administration, it is time to begin eliminating the privileges of the prahbi and eliminating the autonomy of the lordships. We can shed this medieval institution of delegated power, and continue to elevate the supreme power of the Lotus Throne."

It was not many years ago when the hobgoblins swept away the kingdoms of Shamakhad and looked poised to subjugate the whole of Haless beneath their iron greaves. It was not many years ago when the land where the High Gods walked was divided in faith and law, in philosophy and ideology. It was not many years ago when these things were true.\n\nBut today is a different day. Today is a day when the Empire of Harimar is whole again, when threats both external and internal have been crushed, when dissension of the mind and the body is no more. Today is a day when the Raja in Dhenijansar is no longer master of Haless in name alone. Today is the day when peace is assured and prosperity guaranteed for the millions of souls who live under our protection. The First Harimraj fell to the same infighting that almost slew us, but we have overcome. We are the Second Harimraj, they that have proven themselves Harimar’s rightful heirs. Eternal we reign - there need be none after us."

Many traitorous ministers have already been purged and sentenced for their corrupt and self-aggrandizing acts, and this has left some gaping holes in the operational apparatus of the ministries. These positions must be filled to restore the empire’s efficient functioning, but we cannot risk filling these posts with more corruption and nepotism. We will need new advisors and loyal ministers who are not ambitious and power-hungry like their predecessors.

In the countryside and borderlands, where the ministries play a vital role in agricultural administration and function as governors, corruption is still a concern. It is time to focus our efforts at reinvigorating the rural ministry, removing those prelates who have grown fat and complacent and replacing them with capable functionaries who will ensure prosperity and wealth for our subjects - and thus, ourselves."

Between these two great temples once ran a highway of paved stones that connected the major settlements along the Kharunyana and Narajandi’s banks. This road was traveled equally by merchants and those holy supplicants looking to discover the wisdom of the gods, and so it became known as the Pilgrim’s Road.\n\nOnce the most important road in Rahen, the importance of the Pilgrim’s Road has long since been surpassed by the golden highway - but the Ziggurats of Tiger and Elephant are still great wonders, and many still venture to see them.

Sometimes called the Beating Heart of Haless due to its central location on the continent and two of its major rivers, this name can only be considered apt if Haless suffers a terrible affliction of the veins. Sarisung is rotten to the core - anything more than a cursory examination of the city will reveal it to be the most despicable location on Haless, a lawless slum run by gangs and crime lords, a hive of scum and villainy where the only currency is malice, and the only abundance mortal suffering.\n\nLong beyond the reach of any state strong enough to conquer its five boroughs, we are once again strong enough to liberate Sarisung from itself.

While all seek to walk the path of the high gods and attain their divinity, the exact nature of the holy path is a hotly debated topic. The lack of centralized power in Rahen has led the debates that would normally settle and codify these disputes to be held haphazardly - in recent years, it has become rare for full treatises to be accurately recorded and cataloged, the important words of many a philosopher lost in the flow of time for lack of a scribe. Our people will never move closer to holiness if such blasphemous inattention continues - we must task the ministries with establishing a central forum for philosophical debates and publications, ensuring that all sacred revelations and theological arguments are taken down for study and consideration by posterity."

What began as disagreements of doctrine evolved into deep-seated personal hatred, the quest for divinity sullied by the base weakness of the mortal soul. Debates that should be constructive stray into vitriolic ad hominem attacks, and philosophers publish treatises demeaning their enemies in character as much as in ideas.\n\nSuch disunity does nothing but damage the legitimacy of the faith and sow doubt in the hearts and minds of its adherents. We must put the worst of these conflicts to rest - convene a grand conciliatory conference, calling together the greatest thinkers of each of the major Schools, and set these brilliant men to work through their issues and come to some sort of resolution.

As ever more land comes under the control of the Harimraj, we will need more highly trained ministers than ever before.

Though Raheni influence along the Yanhe has long ended below the cataracts at Sir, this has not always been the case. In the years after the splintering of the first Rahenraj, a great Raheni kingdom ruled the Yanhe from Bianfang to the Jade Hills.\n\n Yanhadesh, as it was known, was the greatest of the northern Raheni realms, and its rule lasted until Harimar’s unstoppable march extinguished it in 49 AA. When Harimar’s eastern heirs fell, Yanhadesh was lost as well, and no efforts by the Raheni to reconquer Upper Yanshen and North Xianjie ever succeeded. We must end this streak of military setbacks, replicate Harimar’s deeds, and march down the Yanhe. We will conquer the lands once held by mighty Yanhadesh and fold them into our ever-expanding empire - for the glory of the past, and the glory of the future."

 R51_tiger_on_yanhe_desc:0 "Our rule over the middle Yanhe river has been solidified in recent years, but we now grapple with the same problem that Harimar did when his Shastabari conquered Yanshen. The Yan have never been a united people - only by foreign warlords have they ever been brought together into empire, and regional rivalries abound even among cities separated by only a few miles. Administration of such a region poses constant challenges, exacerbated by our status as foreigners and the diverse religious beliefs that flourish along the Yanhe’s banks. Overcoming this fractiousness will require concerted efforts to spread the light of High Philosophy and Raheni civilization, but in time the people will come to see us as the rightful and fair masters of the land, as Harimar once did."

 R51_eunuch_ministers_desc:0 "When Harimar conquered the east and folded its many peoples into his empire, he was faced with the novel issue of building an imperial bureaucracy from scratch. Unlike Rahen, with its existing castes and the unifying influence of the Raj Ministries, no such superstructure existed in Yanshen for the administration of the realm. Instead of expanding the caste system, Harimar created a new bureaucracy that would better fit the customs of the Yan - the Eunuch administrators.\n\nIn time the Eunuchs would become even more influential than the ministries ever were in Rahen, and after the collapse of the eastern portions of Harimar’s realm, the eunuchs continued to govern what were now independent princedoms. Now that much of Yanshen has been folded back into our realm, the question has been raised concerning how we shall handle the eunuch ministers, and how to fold their administrative expertise into the expanding Raj Ministries. This merger will take time, but gaining so many talented scribes and administrators will surely be good for the Harimraj."

 R51_reunite_northern_lotus_desc:0 "Before the lords of the Lotus Claw were masters of Dhenijansar, they began as the unimportant rulers of a petty kingdom in the west of Rahen centered around the old fortress of Durasidheni. Though they were largely apolitical administrators during the Jaherian Empire, the family would first rise to prominence during the collapse of elven rule in Haless. In the midst of the Jaerelic wars, a headstrong scion of the family named Dhubuvar led a company of adventurers to the aid of the city of Sarnavan, which was in open revolt against its elven governors. Dhubuvar and his adventurer companions joined the resistance, organized the defenders, and liberated the city.\n\n For these deeds, Dhubuvar was elected king of Sarnavan, and his descendants have ruled the city ever since. In this, they retain the distinction as the more established branch of the Lotus Claw dynasty, even when their cousins claimed the mantle of Harimraja. Union between the two branches of the family has been a long dream of the Raj - and with the threat of the hobgoblins looming large in the north, there has never been a better time to absorb Sarnavan. By pen or sword, we must unify the two Lotus Thrones."

Since the hobgoblin invasion destroyed Sir and Ghatask, Rajnadhaga has become the most powerful of the Ruin Kingdoms, and the state most likely to resist the advance of the Command. The resources of the kingdom are many - and we must have them if we are to save Rahen from the Northern Menace and unite the Subcontinent under our benevolent rule. The last of the human kings must kneel before the Lotus Throne - only once our flank is secured shall we turn our attention to the Red Horde in Shamakhad"

When the Hobgoblins swept down out of the mountains, they caught the northern kingdoms of Ghattask and Raghajandi completely by surprise. Sir, great bastion of learning and the gateway to Yanshen, barely had time to organize its defense before the dread legions of Moguwon the Black Wolf crashed upon their walls.\n\nSir’s subjugation was a brutal affair that featured years of guerilla warfare, during which time many warriors and nobles fled south through the similarly occupied Kingdom of Tilathi. These exiled soldiers have long clamored for a champion to take the fight to the Command and liberate their homeland from the monstrous invaders from the mountains - and with control over the remaining Ruin Kingdoms consolidated, it is time to become the champions that the northerners need. The time for the Great Northern War has come - and we will either triumph in glory or fall beneath the Three-Headed Banner of the foe."

The exiled nobility of Sir has taken up the work of reoccupying their ancestral holdings and repairing the damage done to their holdings, but just to the north, the Command regathers their strength. The work that we began in our last campaign is not yet done - the Raghajandi Valley is still occupied by the enemy, and their ancient strongholds in the foothills of the Serpentspine will certainly offer them a place to gather their strength if we do not push on and drive them back into the tunnels of the Jade Mines. One last great push is needed - it is time to break the Three-Headed Monstrosity once and for all."

Looming over the plain of Shamakhad, the mountains of the Jade Mines stand foreboding and dark, and none can look north without wondering when the next tide of destruction will descend from the ancient holds of the dwarves.\n\nUnless and until the Sashtabari march into the dark tunnels of the dwarovar themselves and break the remnants of the hobgoblin’s empire, we will never be free of the nightmare of the Wolf, Lion, and Boar. We must go where no army of men and harimari has gone before - into the shadowed heart of Gronstunad, to fight until the last remnants of the Command are no more."

 R51_integrate_hobgoblins_desc:0 "For the first time in living memory, the threat of Hobgoblin invasion does not linger over Shamakhad. The scars of the Command’s march over the land are still fresh, and the signs of the Chimera’s passage are evident for all to see. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the large hobgoblin population that now resides on the plains around the Yanhe river, farming the land and living in insular communal dwellings. Some have advocated for the forced removal of these invaders from the lands their warlords stole from the native Raghajandi - but there may be another way. Though many would be loathe to admit it, the values of the hobgoblins - their focus on discipline and community - are not so different from values deeply embedded in Raheni society. Rather than expelling them, perhaps there is a path by which they could become a part of the fabric of our society…"

A new culture is emerging before our eyes, a great blending of nations and people and ideas - it is something that we must get a hold of before it takes on a life of its own and evolves beyond the influence of the Raja. Let us support this emerging 'Tiger Hobgoblin' culture, promote cooperation between the races of the land, and begin a thorough integration of hobgoblin family structures into the existing castes."

 R51_hobgoblin_military_desc:0 "The hobgoblins have continued to prove themselves a great boon to our society - their merchants and craftsmen are highly sought after, and their communities are quietly prosperous and generally apolitical. In light of this, there has been some discussion from bold-minded officers about embracing the martial aspects of hobgoblin culture, and greatly expanding the strength of our armies by beginning to accept hobgoblins as recruits.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that they are among the best soldiers to ever walk Halann, there has been a general paranoia in the high command about rearming the hobs, with some thinking that a new Command will spring forth the moment that the hobgoblins are permitted to take up arms again. Their discipline and martial skill may make this a risk worth taking, regardless of our past experiences. Imagine, after all, if the hobs fought alongside the harimari, instead of against us - what armies could stand against us then?"

Flavour_R51_events.1.d:0 "In the early days of the second Harimraj, Ramapalar the Reunifier sought to conquer the merchant cities of the South Rahen Coast, but the allied Raghimdeshi city-states offered stiff resistance to the Raja’s armies. The Reunifier placed his son, Ramapalar the Azure Falcon, in charge of breaking the resistance of the Raghimdeshi, and the crown prince of the Lotus Claw led this war for three years before his father passed and he took the mantle of Raja. Ramapalar II resumed his campaigns shortly after his coronation, intent on completing the task he had been dedicated to for so many years, and smashed the armies of the mercantile alliance when he forced them into battle at Shenral, the Bloody Gate.\n\nRamapalar II’s victory was short lived, however - four days after his great victory, his entourage encountered a group of stragglers from the shattered Raghimdeshi armies and moved in for what they thought would be an easy battle. Fate intervened, however, and a stray arrow that glanced from the shields of his bodyguard struck Ramapalar in the eye and killed the young Raja instantly. Suddenly leaderless, the armies of the Harimraj retreated chaotically. The near-doom of the southern cities was averted almost entirely by chance, and the Raj would never come so close to conquering the rich coastal plain of Raghimdesh.\n\nNever, that is, until today. The Claw and Lotus Banner flies over every city and fortress from Davharral to Sardika, and the great harbor of Sarkashabid is under the control of imperial sentries and tax collectors. The killers of the Azure Falcon, the defiant lands of the south, kneel before the lotus throne at last. Their riches are now the Raja’s, as they should be by right, and the domain of Harimar’s rightful heirs stretches once more to the southern horizon."
