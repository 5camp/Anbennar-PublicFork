 fragments.2.t:0 "Realm of the Hidden Dragon"
 fragments.2.d:0 "It is said that in a time before the Precursor Empire… was an age known as The Rule of Dragons.\n\nA time where the elven people were slaves to the Dragon Scions, who warred amongst themselves for hegemony over Aelantir… until a member of the Dragonguard, elite warrior-slaves taught magic to fight on their master’s behalf, decided to act – killing their draconic master. This hero was known as Venaan, who is said to be the originator of the word ‘elven’ in the first place (meaning of Venaan), and with his act of defiance more and more Dragonguard began to overthrow and kill their masters, leading to mass rebellion across Aelantir.\nWith magic harnessed by the Dragonguard and the will of the elven slaves across the continent, the tyrannous dragons were beaten and wiped to near extinction: the rest were said to be cursed to become mindless beasts and wander the world… except one.\n\nAmadian myth speak of ancient warriors who fought to protect their ‘scaled master’ from ‘a war of bonds’. It is said these ancient warriors appeared once again with their master during the Day of Ashen Skies, and rescued those they deemed ‘pure of heart’ to take the master’s hidden realm. \nLike most stories, it shows a grain of truth – but our mages have confirmed that the magical auras in Amadia seem to concentrate at some parts of the region one day, and the next, disappear. If this is this alleged realm of the last dragon the legends speak of, who knows what knowledge and riches we could find?"
 fragments.2.a:0 "We must find this hidden realm!"
 fragments.2.b:0 "Chasing hidden dimensions? No thanks."
 
 fragments.201.t:0 "Hidden Dragon: Observation Posts"
 fragments.201.d:0 "With the quest to find the Realm of the Hidden Dragon well underway, our exploration groups have dispatched adventurers across the land to set up observation posts to track and locate these magical surges. The question is: where shall our main headquarters be?"
 fragments.201.a:0 "Perhaps the highest point we can find?"
 fragments.201.b:0 "At the centre of the region, of course"
 fragments.201.c:0 "Among the local tribes"
 
 fragments.202.t:0 "Hidden Dragon: Massive Surge!"
 fragments.202.d:0 "A surge of magic has been detected in $PROVINCENAME$.\nFrom a layman’s eyes it was nothing but a large clearing in the jungle, but to us: it was proof. It seems our observation posts did not simply track this alleged hidden realm, but also tampered with the stability of its movements – and caused something to leave tracks. The soil was not of this region. The rocks were scattered as if thrown by force in all directions, but most importantly… a single spear found buried in the ground.\n\nThe spear was clearly more advanced than the ruinborn were capable of. When shown to archaeologists they could see clear precursor origins, but they noted that some parts of the spear were newer than the rest. The shaft was made of strange wood unlike any we’ve seen in Amadia, and was dated to be only ten years old. The spearhead was much older, of course, and bore the mark of precursor steel, but with one caveat: it had the signs of frequent care. \nBut the most important thing was what the mages said: it had a strange lingering scent of magic. One that was not of this plane. What we do with this spear will no doubt determine our success."
 fragments.202.a:0 "Use it as a grounding rod"
 fragments.202.b:0 "We're done with it, sell it to the highest bidder!"
 fragments.202.c:0 "We need to research it further"
 
 fragments.203.t:0 "Hidden Dragon: Planebinding"
 fragments.203.d:0 "It is confirmed. Something outside the Prime Material is indeed linking at irregular periods within Amadia. We seem to have caught its attention, and in the recent months it seems to have stopped connecting to our plane.\n\nThe greatest mages and artificers in our employ suggest one final course of action: to feign the closure of our endeavours… and lay a trap. And when the time is right, we will bind this pocket plane into our own, restoring it to its natural place in our realm – and allowing our adventurers to finally enter this hidden realm.\n\nWe must act quickly."
 fragments.203.a:0 "Prepare the trap."
 fragments.203.b:0 "Call upon the power of the mage and artificer estates!"
 fragments.203.c:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s prowess in Abjuration will help."
 
 fragments.204.t:0 "Hidden Dragon: The Illusive Realm"
 fragments.204.d:0 "We waited and waited, and nothing. It seems that this hidden realm has escaped our grasp.\n\nAs we dismantled our outposts a junior scholar reported seeing the shadow of a flying beast overhead, but no one else could confirm their findings. Perhaps the next adventurers will have better luck with the Realm of the Hidden Dragon."
 fragments.204.a:0 "Damn!"
 
 fragments.205.t:0 "Hidden Dragon: Assault on the Realm"
 fragments.205.d:0 "In what used to be a stretch of jungle was now a valley that looked like Amadia before the Ruin. A large paved path stretched across the valley to the top, with humble stone houses dotted by the roadside. At the very end of the road, up a mountain, was a grand palace with huge gates that welcomed all sorts of life in, and presumably, allowed a dragon to fly out.\nThe valley, however was empty. The houses looked lived in, but there was no one to be seen. Had they fled? It didn’t matter. The looting had already begun, and large contingents of our explorers began to enter the houses and carry back treasures to safer lands.\nOur main group crept their way to the palace and were greeted by the temple guards, who bore armour resembling those of the ancient Dragonguard that once liberated Aelantir. But behind them, was a sight stunned the adventurers. A dragon. Shiny and crimson, sprawled across the span of the entire palace floor.\n\nThe scaled beast spoke, and with each word, the land itself shook. "I bid you entrance to my haven, in hopes of answering your curiosity. But now I see I have been mistaken," the beast continued, and looked at one of our ruinborn guides. "For my people, the disaster has only been a hundred years ago, yet you bear the scars of a time beyond that. I pity you. For what your ancestors had done to my people, and what your ancestors have done to the world." The beast then returned its gaze to our explorer. "By temporarily binding my realm to yours, I have seen what fate has befallen the world, to Druzbhazinl, and I want nothing to do with it. SO BEGONE!"\n\nWith fiery breath most of our adventurers were extinguished, and those that were lucky managed to make it back out of the valley, and not a second later, it was gone, and the jungle returned to its place."
 fragments.205.a:0 "At least we know these artifacts are one of a kind."
 
 fragments.206.t:0 "Hidden Dragon: A Realm Bound"
 fragments.206.d:0 "In what used to be a stretch of jungle was now a valley that looked like Amadia before the Ruin. A large paved path stretched across the valley all the way to the top, with humble stone houses dotted by the roadside. At the very end of the road, up a mountain, was a grand palace with huge gates that welcomed all sorts of life in, and presumably, allowed a dragon to fly out.\nOur adventurers poured into the valley and started looting. The inhabitants of the valley put up a resistance, but their spears were no match for our guns. Adventurers broke formation and stole all manner of things, from ornate artefacts to the clothes off the backs of the inhabitants and fled back to safer lands.\nThe core group fought their way to the grand temple and clashed with the temple guards, who flung strange magic at us, using their spears as spellcasting foci. They bore armour resembling those of the ancient Dragonguard that once liberated Aelantir, but in the end they were no match\n\n"You have meddled with our realm for thousands of years, since our saviour took us to his home, and now you invade? The day after he died?" one of the Dragonguard questioned, before being struck by a bullet. \n\nThousands of years? Our quest started a few years ago at best, but no Dragonguard survived to answer more questions. In the end, the palace was indeed empty of any dragon, but full of riches from an age that predated the precursors."
 fragments.206.a:0 "The realm has been returned to the prime material, and with it, its riches"
 
 fragments.3.t:0 "The Elfenbride"
 fragments.3.d:0 "Ynnic legends speak of what we can now translate as the ‘Elfenbride’, a woman (or being) of immense power that she could break worlds – and that she is still alive, wandering the woods of Northern Aelantir.\n\nWhether it is true or not, finding a living member of the precursor elves, or even an intact building, would be a finding to put us in the history books!"
 fragments.3.a:0 "Let's find her!"
 fragments.3.b:0 "What folly. Forget it!"
 
 fragments.301.t:0 "Elfenbride: Midnight Visit"
 fragments.301.d:0 "The northern forests of Aelantir is a place of thick trees and barely any sunlight. It is said that one could get lost in these woods just as one would get lost in the Deepwoods back in Cannor – perhaps even more so.\nIn the dead of night, the entire camp was woken up by what seemed like fireflies surrounding the camp – but no, it was fairies! These fey resembled miniature humans but with butterfly-like wings, and laughed with joy as they played pranks on the men – stealing trinkets as they buzzed above like bees.\n\n "You wish to find our queen? Look for a tree split between two worlds, dearie! Hee-hee!" one of them shouted.\n\n"No trust fey, captain," one our own men whispered. The man was of ruinborn stock, one of the cursed ones, brutish and imposing. "Fey in forest. Mean harm. They Dark. Unseelie. Look good, but actually, bad." he grunted.\n\nEventually, the sprites disappeared into the woods, but by the time the group gathered their senses, it was sunlight. The explorers had not slept, but it was time to go."
 fragments.301.a:0 "It wasn't, actually, we can afford to rest here for the day."
 fragments.301.b:0 "The ruinborn is right, we must not trust the fey!"
 fragments.301.c:0 "They were clearly seelie fey, which are the good ones!"
 
 fragments.302.t:0 "Elfenbride: Unfinished Tomb"
 fragments.302.d:0 "Atop a hill looming above the small abandoned village, is an unfinished tomb.\n\nReality is broken on this hill. The air hums with dark energy. Monsters of the night seem to appear out of nowhere, some unknown to both the people of Aelantir and Cannor. It is shaped by a black stone, and was not shaped by hand. The tomb is as large as a town hall but much of it is incomplete, and the black stone that seems to have been enveloping the building has left honeycomb-like holes. Peering into them returns only darkness.\nIt is too dark to see any detail in the tomb, but whatever riches in here seem to be long gone. One of the lads does find a stone tablet written in precursor script. Some of it is damaged, but it reads:\n\n"I have come to search for my mother, but have found only the tomb of the destroyer… received stone message… her garden west… destroyer dead… but mind warriors lurk in the woods."\n\nAs the scholar finishes reading, a ghostly chill runs down his spine, and he begs for the group to leave. Many have left already, seeming to prefer the company of the gloomy forest than the tomb."
 fragments.302.a:0 "Cowards! I will search this tomb myself!"
 fragments.302.b:0 "Let us head west as soon as possible!"
 fragments.302.c:0 "We must try and decipher more of this tablet."
 
 fragments.303.t:0 "Elfenbride: The Changeling Prince"
 fragments.303.d:0 "The forests of Old Rzenta seem much brighter and friendlier than the ones in the east. They are the same evergreen trees, but there seems to be life in these old giants yet. The company eventually meet with a peculiar tribe, who told us of a tale about a prince from the east.\n\n"The prince was a man born of impure union. Born of brother and niece. Of destroyer and creator. To protect her shameful act, the mother gave up the prince and conjured a sickly child doomed to die in his place – in hopes to trick the world, and she did. The darkness soon came and the destroyer died, but with him so did the world – but the prince was safe.\nThe prince grew to be strong, but sought to find his lost mother, and in his grief dedicated his life to see her again. His search led him to this very forest. He never found his mother, for he could not see between two worlds as the elders warned, but instead settled down and found a home."\n\nFurther research alludes that this is the very same prince, yes, and that the destroyer is no other than Ducaniel himself. Could the Elfenbride, his niece, be the cause of the war that brought upon The Ruin of Aelantir?\n\nNo matter. The Elfenbride’s last location is close. It is in the forests of Old Rzentur, and we have something the prince did not wield - magic."
 fragments.303.a:0 "Use our magical resources to track down the Elfenbride!"
 fragments.303.b:0 "We deciphered the tablet, which should help a lot!"
 fragments.303.c:0 "Let the search begin!"
 tooltip_elfenbride_tablet:0 "The prince, whos name was Rinetrin, was the son of the Elfenbride and her uncle, Ducaniel - and it was their forced union that caused the war that ended Aelantir. Rinetrin's calculations to find his mother almost look like two different investigations. One alludes to interplanar business, the Fey Realm no doubt, but he had a real, true lead in Old Rzentur. There is no place between worlds, but a place hidden in plain sight!"

 fragments.304.t:0 "Elfenbride: Lost in the Woods"
 fragments.304.d:0 "By the gods!\n\nThese woods are a maze, as if we were the Castanites during the Exodus - wheezing and being led circles by trees and fey tricks.\nSometimes we catch a glimpse of a figure, leaving us to wonder if we should follow it deeper into the forest.\nNorth becomes south, right becomes left, and many of our explorers have decided to leave for to homeland, and we should to."
 fragments.304.a:0 "I'm lost in the woods!"
 
 fragments.305.t:0 "Elfenbride: Green Welcome"
 fragments.305.d:0 "A single tree. Split between two worlds. On one half, life and vibrancy. On the other, you can see the browns of autumn leaves coming in, and aged bark contrasted with new.\nOne of your men touches it, and disappears! You follow.\n\nYou are greeted with a sea of greenery. Laughter and thick, humid forest air dominate your senses. Birds chirp and motes and pixies float as if stars.\nIn the distance, a donkey-headed man lounges surrounded by nymphs. And behind them, soldiers.\n\nA well-built figure, armoured in what looks like hardened leaves lead the column. The green knight utters a single word and many of your companions fall into a trance. Some collapse. The knight’s contingent begins to grab and abduct your men.\nHe goes for you, and in the tussle, you manage to yank his helm off – revealing ethereal, elf-like visage. You run deep into the forest. It is ancient, and nothing like the one you saw before. You hide in the dirt and sink yourself into a small lake to the point of almost drowning.\n\nAs the night passes, the sounds of joy and laughter from the court become almost deafening. You swear you could hear the voice of one of your compatriots amongst the noise. But, eventually, you manage to sleep.\n\nThe next time you open your eyes you are alone. But it feels cold now. You are back in Old Rzentur. You are still clutching the green knight’s helmet as if a child holding a comforter. You return back to civilization, with stories to tell, and a piece of another world.\n\nYou would return to Old Rzentur one day, many years from now, hoping to find that same tree, but you never do. You settle with a local tribe and live out your days, like the prince before you."
 fragments.305.a:0 "Was that the court of the Fey Queen?"
 
 fragments.306.t:0 "Elfenbride: The Manse"
 fragments.306.d:0 "You do not find a tree, or any sign of a place between worlds. But your findings do lead you to a thick patch of forest.\nOne of the men raises his machete to cut a path through, but you pause. A rabbit emerges from the brush. They don’t belong in these parts. You lock eyes with it, and it darts into a hole.\n\nFollowing the hole led to a path that you could fit through, with care, and eventually, it leads you to the other side.\n\nYou begin to sweat. Is it warmer than before? And then it strikes you.\n\nGreenery as far as the eye can see. Colourful shrubbery dots the landscape, as if neatly preserved in some sort of magical stasis. A large glass building invites you and your companions, and even more strange and wonderful flora can be seen inside. Trees and plants that exist in places like Insyaa or Taychend seem to find a home here: a perfectly preserved habitat.\n\nAll parts of the vast estate lead to a grand palace, with recognizable precursor stylizations of the Empire. This does not seem like a place to loot, but a place to preserve. The Elfenbride was no longer here, but she has left us with the best and brightest buildings, plants and animals of her people – the rest of Aelantir seems like a shadow in comparison to an Aelantir-that-was."
 fragments.306.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 
 fragments.4.t:0 "Quest for the Birthplace of the Empire"
 fragments.4.d:0 “The revelation that Castellos is dead has shocked Cannor to its core, but with that discovery, we have learned more about how the Precursor Empire itself formed. The murals in the same ruins revealed that Castellos was Castellar, a precursor god, also stretched back to the origins of elvenkind.\n\nIt depicts the ancient elves in chains, bound to their draconic overlords, and later on, shows the elves breaking free from those bonds – confirming The War of Broken Chains that the elves of Cannor speak about in their traditional tales. But the section after that is what interests us: an image of elves gathered round in a chamber, clasping hands around a central source of power. Within that source of power, a strangle diamond-like symbol.\n\nThis key symbol appears very little in the precursor texts we have seen, but following any traces of it may lead to a greater understanding behind the rise of the Precursor Empire.”
