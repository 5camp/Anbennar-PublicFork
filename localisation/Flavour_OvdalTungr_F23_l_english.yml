 F23_the_mountain_smothers_desc:0 "Goblins.\n\nDestructive, miserable beings. Our ancestors fought them, long ago, but until as recently as half a century ago, we thought that they were a pest confined to the Serpentspine.\n\nThe Decades of Devastation taught us otherwise, and we must now deal with the goblins, as our forefathers tried to. Show the Mountainhuggers our fury! They have hugged the mountains of this region, and will now find themselves smothered between the Tûngr Mountains and the Serpentreach!"

 F23_the_rival_republic_title:0 "The Rival 'Republic'"
 F23_the_rival_republic_desc:0 "With the so-called 'Republic' of Re-Uyel crushed, Western Bahar has been made much safer. However, with war over, the spoils of war should be appropriately divided.\n\nAfter all, Crathanor did not fight this war alone, so even if they might have been granted the land in the peace treaty, it is only appropriate to bring up a more equitable division of the spoils, with Ovdal Tûngr being granted the city of Re-Uyel itself."
 F23_the_rival_republic_tt:0 "The province owner may cede this province to §YOvdal Tûngr§!."

 F23_securing_our_heartlands_title:0 "Securing our Heartlands"
 F23_securing_our_heartlands_desc:0 "During our millennia-long history, the only significant changes to our borders happened during the Days of the Ashen Skies, as some of the land we controlled disappeared beneath the waves. Only the Uthojdihr found themselves frequently leaving the Hold, and even then, they did so to trade rather than to conquer.\n\nHowever, the last few decades have shown us that this isolationism is not enough to guarantee the safety of the Tûngr mountains. No, we must ensure that there is a strong line of defence between our heartlands and any would-be invaders!"

 # 2C
 F23_butting_heads_title:0 "Butting Heads"
 F23_butting_heads_desc:0 "We first had to deal with Mountainhuggers, but they are not the only goblin clan - or even the largest. No, the most powerful of the invaders are the Marbleheads. If we wish to know peace and prosperity once more, we must march against them, seize the province of Aqatbar, and ensure that they can never again threaten us!"

 F23_republican_reaffirmation_title:0 "Republican Reaffirmation"
 F23_republican_reaffirmation_desc:0 "Were Ovdal Tûngr and Crathánor lesser republics we might turn on each other, now that we have vanquished the Mountainhuggers and the 'republic' of Re-Uyel.\n\nNo such thing will happen, however! Instead, we will let our shared struggles lay the foundation for an even deeper bond, one which will allow us to stand together against the world!"

 F23_a_better_bahar_title:0 "A Better Bahar"
 F23_a_better_bahar_desc:0 "Since the Decades of Devastation, Bahar has not known true peace. The goblins were not the only threat to peace in the region - Re-Uyel's repression of the Ilatani also prevented true peace - so driving the Mountainhugger and the Marblehead Clan from Bahar will not be enough to secure peace.\n\nNo, if we wish for the people of Bahar to prosper, to be able to walk from one end to another without needing to fear for their lives, we must see the entire region controlled by us or our allies and expel any invader goblins who might linger!"

 F23_looking_beyond_bahar_title:0 "Looking Beyond Bahar"
 F23_looking_beyond_bahar_desc:0 "The past few decades has forced our focus away from the seas, but with Bahar secure our attention can finally be turned back to maritime matters. Long have merchants and captains complained about pirates, hailing from Nathalaire and Drokaland, who have grown rich off of plundering our trade lanes.\n\nWe must first prepare our navy to deal with these miscreants, and to do so, we must expand our shipyards, and then recruit human rowers from our Crathanori allies to row for our galleys."

 F23_the_bahari_standard_title:0 "The Bahari Standard"
 F23_the_bahari_standard_desc:0 "With all of Bahar in friendly hands, the Uthojdihr are insisting that local currencies be replaced by a so-called Bahari Standard. Not only would this ease commerce across Bahar, but it would also allow the state to better lend and borrow.\n\nOf course, we would need a steady and secure supply of gold to back up this new currency, so our local gold mines must be expanded."

 F23_our_ilatani_allies_title:0 "An Ilatani Ally"
 F23_our_ilatani_allies_desc:0 "Our allies in Crathanor - or rather, Istrahures! - have stood by our side, and we by theirs. So now that they have secured their ancient homeland, we must help ensure that it never falls again.\n\nTo this end, several cadres of Dwarves will be sent to Businor, whether to simply settle and lend their aid as skilled craftsmen, or seek out metal veins in hills and mountains to establish foundaries and communities."
 F23_our_ilatani_allies_tt:0 "Every Businori province controlled by Istrahures which produces copper or iron will gain a small dwarven minority, will have a Weapons Manufactory built, and gain the §YCopper Presence§! modifier. For each such province, Ovdal Tûngr will pay §Y250§! ducats."

 F23_uthojdihr_influence_desc:0 "Most Copper Dwarves are content to remain within the Tûngr Mountains for their entire life, enjoying the dark and safety of our mountain home.\n\nMost.\n\nSome Copper Dwarves - the Uthojdihr - have somehow taken a liking to the opens ocean, and have ventured across the Divenhal since ancient times, and to this day trade with strange coins in strange tongues in strange places. While they are thought mad by most Copper Dwarves, it is undeniable that they bring vast riches and resources to our realm. With more and more of Bahar falling under our sway, they have requested assistance in expanding their trade facililities, to gain further riches."

 F23_westward_expansion_title:0 "Westward Expansion"
 F23_westward_expansion_desc:0 "Eborthil is the bottleneck to the Divenhal, and the island - or rather, the straits around it - has brought great riches to whoever controlled it.\n\nFor millennia, this has been various human polities - most recently Eborthil - but if they can be bested on the seas, we can seize control of the island, control the narrow straits around it, and use it as a springboard to control the entirety of the Divenhal Sea."
 F23_westward_expansion_tt:0 "If we complete this mission within 10 years of Improved Trading Posts, we will receive §G+20% Trade Efficiency§! for 25 years."

 F23_divenhal_straits_title:0 "Divenhal Straits"
 F23_divenhal_straits_desc:0 "From Stonegaze and the Lion's Pass, the Busilari Straits are controlled and taxed by the respective authorities. The straits between Eborthil and Akasik, on the other hand? Thanks to the pirates of Viakkoc, they are usually avoided by most - but not all - merchants, with some captains gambling on sailing south of Eborthil, eluding toll fees at the risk of running into pirates.\n\nIf we seize control of the strait and set up regular patrols to deter pirates, we can enforce tolls on this strait as well, further cementing our control over the entrance to the Divenhal - though the profitability of this toll will suffer while pirates linger."

 F23_no_scourge_in_our_seas_title:0 "No Scourge in Our Seas"
 F23_no_scourge_in_our_seas_desc:0 "Pirates, bah.\n\nThe gnolls call themselves the Scourge of the Sea, but a more apt comparison for pirates as a whole would be the scum of the seas.\n\nPreying on honest merchants, hindering commerce, and often engaged in the darkest of trades, the pirates are a blight which must be removed!"

 F23_extending_our_reach_title:0 "Extending our Reach"
 F23_extending_our_reach_desc:0 "With the pirates dealt with, it is time to truly solidify our grasp on the Divenhal. Together with our subjects and allies, we shall construct a series of naval bases around the Divenhal, allowing us to better protect our interests."
 F23_extending_our_reach_trigger_tt:0 "At least one province in this trade node must have coastline terrain, an empty building slot, a shipyard, and be owned by a friendly nation. (§Y75§! trust threshold)"
 F23_extending_our_reach_tt:0 "One province in each trade node will have its trade good changed to fish, have a §YNaval equipment manufactory§! built at half cost and speed, and will gain the §YLocal Naval Base§! province modifier, giving §Y+5 Local trade power§! and §Y+2 Naval force limit§!. If the province is owned by a subject of ours, the province will be ceded to Ovdal Tûngr."

 F23_divenhal_dominion_title:0 "Divenhal Dominion"
 F23_divenhal_dominion_desc:0 "From Ehka to Brasan, from Nathelaire to Koroshesh Copper Ships are found. Every centre of trade worth its name is crawling with Uthojdihr merchants, while our fleet ensures that merchants can safely ferry their goods to and fro.\n\nWhat was once a dream among the Uthojdihr has become reality, and their ambitions have seen our coffers filled to the brim. We rule the Divenhal, and where the ruling clans and common dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr alike once looked down on dwarven sailors, they are now held in high esteem, with the Uthojdihr Clan being considered just as dignified as any other major clan."
 
 # 5B
 F23_eborthili_infrastructure_title:0 "Tefori Infrastructure"
 F23_eborthili_infrastructure_desc:0 "The Isle of Tef could be considered a floating fortress, placed as ideally as one could imagine to control the Divenhal Sea. However, it has never before been in dwarven hands, and thus there is room for improvement.\n\nThe Isle of New Tefkona can be harnessed, with the local fishing industries providing more capacity for our navy and as a source of sailors. Even better, controlling the Isle will allow us to not just expand our minting program, but also accelerate the prevalence of our coins throughout the Divenhal, by mandating that tolls for passing by the Isle be paid in our currency."
 F23_eborthili_infrastructure_tt:0 "This will also apply to the other recipient of The Bahari Standard."

 # 6B
 F23_our_granary_title:0 "Our Granary"
 F23_our_granary_desc:0 "For millennia, the Mother's Delta has been known as 'The Granary of the Divenhal', and for good reason. While the grain produced there is by no means inexhaustible, its sheer fertility cannot be rivalled anywhere else, and being able to source almost all of our grain in Koroshesh would greatly simplify the logistics of ensuring that our trading posts are adequately fed.\n\nAs such, we should seek to gain access to this granary, whether by force and diplomacy, and ensure that it can meet our demand."
 F23_our_granary_tt:0 "All current and future Improved Trading posts will gain §Y-10% Local Development Cost§!."

 F23_resting_yet_productive_title:0 "Resting, yet Productive"
 F23_resting_yet_productive_desc:0 "With the Mother's Sorrow calmed by Istrahures, there is potential for it to become even more productive. It would require significant effort, of course, but doing so would allow us to secure an abundance of food for not just our various trading outposts, but also for our Ilatani allies."
 F23_resting_yet_productive_tt_1:0 "Upgrades the development cost reduction for Improved Trading posts from §Y-10%§! to §Y-20%§!."

 F23_seeking_southern_sarhal_desc:0 "The continent of Sarhal is news to nobody, save perhaps our cousins in the Serpentspine Mountains. However, while we are well aware of the northern parts of the continent, its southern parts is largely a mystery to us, and we do not know the truth from tall tales.\n\nThe Uthojdihr are eager to rectify this, as it is the next logical place for us to extend our trade network to. To do so, we should send not only emissaries, but also a significant fleet which will allow us to project power in the Sarhali Seas."
 
 # 10A
 F23_seizing_the_sweetport_title:0 "Seizing the Sweetport"
 F23_seizing_the_sweetport_desc:0 "To say that Sarhal is of interest to our merchants would be an understatement. Vast lands containing a multitude of people to trade and bargain with is a boon to any trader worth their salt.\n\nOf special interest are the cloves of Fahvanosy, whose ability to make even the dourest of meals at least somewhat palatable with just a few pinches of powder makes it desirable for the common people, while the wealthy and powerful seek to acquire it in even greater quantities.\n\nTo truly break into this market, we should secure its central hub: the bustling Sweetport in Teramzadai."
 F23_seizing_the_sweetport_tt_1:0 "We will be able to use the Lizard Port of Teramzadai."
 F23_seizing_the_sweetport_tt_2:0 "If a nation for a native Fahvanosy culture (Mazava, Mboala, Fomarati, and Amezatany Halflings, as well as Itayzemby Lizardfolk) has at least 150 opinion of us, we will pay §Y50§! less Diplomatic Power to complete this mission. Each culture can provide this discount once."
 F23_seizing_the_sweetport_tt_2_amezatany:0 "We must pay §Y50§! Diplomatic Power, since no nation with §YAmezatany§! culture has §Y150§! opinion of us."

 F23_the_cloves_monopoly_desc:0 "Already, we are wealthy from trading in cloves, with our control of the Sweetport allowing us to streamline the cloves trade and charge even higher sums for the spice.\n\nThere is no reason to stop there, however. If we can ensure that all clove production rests in the hands of us and reduce the costs of transporting cloves to new markets in Haless, we can charge even higher prices!"

 F23_safe_sarhali_seas_desc:0 "Most empires control large swathes of territory, but as the accursed Jaher's Phoenix Empire has shown, such empires are vulnerable and may shatter swiftly in periods of uncertainty. Thus, ours will be different. We shall not set out to seize large swathes of land local demagogues might be able to rally against us, but shall instead conquer the sea and the shipping lanes.\n\nBy controlling the southern Sarhali seas and ensuring that we have well-developed trading outposts in strategic positions, we will be able to profit far more than if we had fought expensive wars of mass conquest against the locals."
 F23_safe_sarhali_seas_trigger_tt:0 "Fulfill the conditions above here."

 F23_the_path_to_haless_desc:0 "Haless. We have known about this continent for millennia, but have seldom had much interaction with them. Before the Golden Highway was built, the trek through the Salahad Desert was a treacherous one, and even after Jaher bound Bulwar and Haless more tightly together, our focus was on maritime trade in Divenhal, rather than sending caravans across the Salahad Desert.\n\nThanks to our trade outposts across southern Sarhal, however, our merchants can make the journey to Haless without venturing across the scorching sands, but can instead use our trading posts to go south of Sarhal.\n\nHowever, the region of Ardimya proves a significant obstacle to journey all the way to Haless, greatly increasing shipping costs for those who do not simply sell their goods to local middlemen. The Strongbellow Society, however, has been badgered into having a look at the situation, and believe that it may be possible to construct a canal to bypass Ardimya - albeit at a significant cost."
 F23_the_path_to_haless_trigger_tt:0 "We must have reached administrative technology level 22, minus 1 tech level for every 20 points of innovativeness we have, and a further discount of 2 tech levels if we have completed the Infrastructure idea group."

 F23_the_copper_seaway_desc:0 "Centuries ago, Jaher's empire was bound together through the Golden Highway. While it was built to facilitate armies and administrators, the Highway also saw merchants bass between Haless and Bulwar in numbers unimaginable before Phoenix Empire.\n\nHowever, for all the splendour and wonder of the Golden Highway, crossing from Bulwar to Haless still requires venturing through a desert, where water is scarce and freight expensive. Much better is the path we have wrought: one built not from golden brick and mortar, but forged from a series of trading posts and well-patrolled sea lanes.\n\nThe Copper Seaway.\n\nThis seaborne path of ours connects not just Bulwar and Haless, but also includes the Divenhal and Sarhal, allowing goods, people, and ideas to travel swifter, safer, and in greater numbers from one end of Halcann to the other than ever thought possible."

Though the Sun Elves might be an obstacle to this goal, they might just be persuaded by glittering gold to cede some ground to us. If not?

Until recently, Ovdal Tûngr would have been an exception, but that has now changed.\n\nWith our growing control over Bahar, and our desire to restore our influence across Bulwar, ensuring that the Harpy Hills is in friendly hands is important for our further ambitions."
 F23_heading_for_the_hills_tt:0 "If this mission is completed through friendly means, we will gain 50 trade power in the Seionqan. Otherwise, Gelkalis will declare rebellion from the eponymous province as our subject, and we will declare war on the former owner of the province."

However, documents shown to us by our new acquintances throughout Bulwar paints a different picture. While it was indeed the Phoenix Empire which maintained the Copper Enclosure and caused us so much suffering, they did not maintain it purely of their own accord.\n\nNo, preserved official correspondence and documentation has shown that Seghdihr - doubtless out of jealousy of the influence we once wielded in Bulwar, and fearful that we might regain it - offered the Phoenix Empire lucrative trade deals, were they to maintain the blockade on our hold.\n\nSuch treachery must be repaid!"
