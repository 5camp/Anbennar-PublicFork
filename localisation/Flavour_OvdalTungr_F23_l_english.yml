# F23_petty_king_protection_desc:0 "No realm around us survived the Decades of Devastation unscathed, but were one to measure misery suffered during that time, the Petty Kingdom of Ourdia would rank highly. Though Bal Ouord still stands, the ancient citadel is largely left in ruins, and the Petty Kingdom found itself surrounded by no less than three goblin tribes.\n\nWhile we have eradicated the Mountainhugger Tribe, Ourdia still faces multiple threats, and might well be amenable to accepting an offer of vassalization to ensure their survival, especially if such an offer is accompanied by enough resources to restore Bal Ouord."
# F23_petty_king_protection_tt:0 "If we fulfill the first condition, Ourdia can become our vassal in exchange for 150 ducats."

# F23_refugee_resettling_title:0 "Refugee Resettling"
# F23_refugee_resettling_desc:0 "While our Hold never suffered any serious threats during the Decades of Devastation, our share of said Devastation was felt in the gold mines of Gulangor, where goblins slaughtered or drove away our people. Now that the province is once more in our grasp, we must ensure that it is properly defended and patrolled, so that we can evict the remaining goblin squatters and allow our people to return to their homes."

 F23_securing_our_heartlands_title:0 "Securing our Heartlands"
 F23_securing_our_heartlands_desc:0 "During our millennia-long history, our borders had largely been static. Only the Uthojdihr found themselves frequently leaving the Hold, and even then, they did so to trade rather than to conquer. The last few decades have shown us that this isolationism is not enough to guarantee the safety of the Tûngr mountains. No, we must ensure that there is a line of defence between our heartlands and any would-be invaders!"

 F23_the_bahari_standard_title:0 "The Bahari Standard"
 F23_the_bahari_standard_desc:0 "With all of Bahar in friendly hands, it has been proposed that the weight and purities of coins should be standardised. Not only would this ease commerce across Bahar, but it would also allow the crown to better lend and borrow. All that is required for this plan is to ensure that we produce enough gold to meet demand for this new currency."

 F23_the_mountain_smothers_title:0 "The Mountain Smothers"
 F23_the_mountain_smothers_desc:0 "Goblins.\n\nDestructive, miserable beings. Our ancestors fought them, long ago, but until as recently as half a century ago, we thought that they were a pest confined to the Serpentspine.\n\nThe Decades of Devastation taught us otherwise, and we must now deal with the goblins, as our forefathers tried to. Show the Mountainhuggers our fury! They have hugged the mountains of this region, and will now find themselves smothered between the Tûngr Mountains and the Serpentreach!"

 F23_butting_heads_title:0 "Butting Heads"
 F23_butting_heads_desc:0 "We first had to deal with Mountainhuggers, but they are not the only goblin clan, or even the largest. No, the most powerful of these is the Marblehead Clan. If we wish to know peace and prosperity once more, we must march against the Marbleheads, and ensure that they can never again threaten us!"
 F23_butting_heads_tt:0 "If Baharkand is out vassal, they will gain permanent claims on these areas instead."

 F23_a_better_bahar_title:0 "A Better Bahar"
 F23_a_better_bahar_desc:0 "Since the Decades of Devastation, Bahar has not known true peace. The goblins were not the only threat to peace in the region - Re-Uyel's repression of the Ilatani also prevented true peace - so driving the Mountainhugger and the Marblehead Clan from Bahar will not be enough to secure peace.\n\nNo, if we wish for the people of Bahar to prosper, to be able to walk from one end to another without needing to fear for their lives, we must ensure that the entire region be under the control of either us or our allies."
 F23_a_better_bahar_tt:0 "If Crathanor is our subject, we will get the option to integrate other potential Bahari vassals and Ourdia into them, so long as these vassals are not players."
 
# F23_baharkand_outreach_title:0 "Baharkand Outreach"
# F23_baharkand_outreach_desc:0 "If not for the leadership of Irran Mallahtum, the goblin invaders might well have overrun western Baharkand completely. However, Irran managed to rally the Baharkand armies, and managed to maintain a slice of the Kingdom of Baharkand.\n\nMany had expected him to crown himself King, but duty - or simply his advanced age - saw him swear fealty to the Kingdom of Azka-Evran, the nominal successor to the Kingdom of Baharkand. However, while Irram remained loyal to that regime, his successor might be swayed to become our subject, if we can convince them that we are a better bet at driving back the goblins."

 F23_looking_beyond_bahar_title:0 "Looking Beyond Bahar"
 F23_looking_beyond_bahar_desc:0 "The past few decades has forced our focus away from the seas, but with Bahar secure, our attention can once again turn to maritime matters. Pirates from Nathalaire and Drokaland plague our trading lanes, and they have grown rich from plunder.\n\nIf we are to put an end to them, we must first prepare our navy to deal with this scourge of the seas. The first step will be to built up infrastructure to expand our navy, while the second will be to recruit human rowers to man our galleys."
 F23_looking_beyond_bahar_tt:0 "The modifier will last 20 years, extended by 10 years for each vassal obtained through missions."

# F23_grudges_declared_title:0 "Grudges Declared"
# F23_grudges_declared_desc:0 "Ever since its inception, relations between the Kingdom of Re-Uyel and Ovdal Tûngr have been chilly thanks to the Copper Enclosure, and we had no doubt that had Re-Uyel had their way, Ovdal Tûngr would have been reduced to rubble.\n\nAs such, we were cautiously optimistic when the Kingdom of Re-Uyel was overthrown, with human officers instead taking the reins. Had they had any sense, an alliance between Humans and Dwarves could have repelled not only goblins, but also the elves from Bahar. However, after they refused to return wealth gained at our behest and extricate elves who bore responsibility for perpetuating the Copper Enclosure, we knew that they were little better than the elven nobles they overthrew.\n\nWe shall make Re-Uyel regret not choosing peace when us when they had the chance, and prepare for the inevitable conflict with them!"

 F23_republican_reaffirmation_desc:0 "Were Ovdal Tûngr and Crathánor lesser republics we might turn on each other, now that we have vanquished the Mountainhuggers and the "republic" of Re-Uyel.\n\nNo such thing will happen, however! Instead, we will let our shared struggles lay the foundation for an even deeper bond, one which will allow us to stand together against the world!"

 F23_uthojdihr_influence_title:0 "Improved Trading Posts"
 F23_uthojdihr_influence_desc:0 "Most Copper Dwarves are content to remain within the Tûngr Mountains, enjoying the dark and safety of our mountain home.\n\nMost.\n\nSome Copper Dwarves, the Uthojdihr, have somehow taken a liking to the ocean, and have ventured across the Divenhal since ancient times, and to this day trade with strange coins in strange tongues in strange places. However, while thought mad by most Copper Dwarves, it is undeniable that they bring vast riches and resources to our realm. With more and more of Bahar falling under our sway, they have requested assistance in expanding their trade facililities, so that they can bring more more wealth."
 F23_uthojdihr_influence_trigger_tt:0 "Has 3 ideas in Maritime, Trade, Plutocratic, or Naval idea groups."

 F23_westward_expansion_title:0 "Westward Expansion"
 F23_westward_expansion_desc:0 "Eborthil is the bottleneck to the Divenhal, and the island - or rather, the straits around it - has brought great riches to whoever controlled it.\n\nFor millennia, this has been various human polities - most recently Eborthil - but if they can be bested on the seas, we can make this wealth our own."
 F23_westward_expansion_tt:0 "If we complete this mission within 10 years of Improved Trading Posts, we will receive §G+20% Trade Efficiency§! for 25 years."

 F23_divenhal_straits_title:0 "Divenhal Straits"
 F23_divenhal_straits_desc:0 "From Stonegaze and the Lion's Pass, the Busilari Straits are controlled and taxed by the respective authorities. The straits between Eborthil and Akasik, on the other hand? Those are traditionally less controlled, due to the presence of Viakkoc, whose piratical ways encourage merchants to sail north of Eborthil and pay the tolls there, instead of going south and escaping said tolls.\n\nEnforcing a southern toll would require a fair amount of patrolling, due to the wider straits, and will have their profitability hampered while Gnoll pirates plague commerce."

 F23_extending_our_reach_title:0 "Extending our Reach"
 F23_extending_our_reach_desc:0 "With the pirates dealt with, it is time to truly solidify our grasp on the Divenhal. Together with our subjects and allies, we shall construct a series of naval bases around the Divenhal.\n\nThese will not only serve as resupply points for our merchant marine, thus becoming minor centres of commerce in their own right but will also help us field a larger fleet to protect our interests!"
 F23_extending_our_reach_trigger_tt:0 "At least one province in this trade node must have coastline terrain, an empty building slot, a shipyard, and be owned by a friendly nation. (§Y75§! trust threshold)"
 F23_extending_our_reach_tt:0 "One province in each trade node will have its trade good changed to fish, have a §YNaval equipment manufactory§! built at half cost and speed, and will gain the §YLocal Naval Base§! province modifier, giving §Y+5 Local trade power§! and §Y+2 Naval force limit§!. If the province is owned by a subject of ours, the province will be ceded to Ovdal Tûngr."

 F23_divenhal_dominion_title:0 "Divenhal Dominion"
 F23_divenhal_dominion_desc:0 "From Ehka to Brasan, from Nathelaire to Koroshesh Copper Ships are found. Every centre of trade worth its name is crawling with Uthojdihr merchants, while our fleet ensures that merchants can safely ferry their goods to and fro.\n\nWhat was once a dream among the Uthojdihr has become reality, and their ambitions have seen our coffers filled to the brim. We rule the Divenhal, and where the ruling clans and common dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr alike once looked down on dwarven sailors, they are now held in high esteem, with the Uthojdihr Clan being considered just as dignified as any other major clan."

 F23_eborthili_infrastructure_title:0 "Eborthili Infrastructure"
 F23_eborthili_infrastructure_desc:0 "The Isle of Tef could be considered a floating fortress, placed as ideally as one could imagine to control the Divenhal Sea. However, it has never before been in dwarven hands, and thus there is room for improvement.\n\nThe Isle of New Tefkona can be harnessed, with the local fishing industries providing more capacity for our navy and as a source of sailors. Even better, controlling the Isle will allow us to not just expand our minting program, but also accelerate the prevalence of our coins throughout the Divenhal, by mandating that tolls for passing by the Isle be paid in our currency."
 F23_eborthili_infrastructure_tt:0 "This will also apply to the other recipient of The Bahari Standard."

 F23_our_granary_title:0 "Our Granary"
 F23_our_granary_desc:0 "For millennia, the Mother's Delta has been known as 'The Granary of the Divenhal', and for good reason. While the grain produced there is by no means inexhaustible, its sheer fertility cannot be rivalled anywhere else, and being able to source almost all of our grain in Koroshesh would greatly simplify the logistics of ensuring that our trading posts are adequately fed.\n\nAs such, we should seek to gain access to this granary, whether by force and diplomacy and ensure that it can meet our demand."
 F23_our_granary_tt:0 "All current and future Improved Trading posts will gain §Y-5% Local Development Cost Modifier§!."

 F23_seeking_southern_sarhal_title:0 "Seeking Southern Sarhal"
 F23_seeking_southern_sarhal_desc:0 "The continent of Sarhal is news to nobody, save perhaps our cousins in the Serpentspine Mountains. However, while we are well aware of the northern parts of the continent, the southern parts of it is barely known to us, and we do not know truth from tales.\n\nThe Uthojdihr are eager to rectify this, as it is the next logical place for us to extend our trade network to, now that we dominate the Divenhal."

 F23_seizing_the_sweetport_title:0 "Seizing the Sweetport"
 F23_seizing_the_sweetport_desc:0 "To say that Sarhal is of interest to our merchants would be an understatement. Vast lands containing a multitude of people to trade and bargain with is a boon to any trader worth their salt.\n\nOf special interest are the cloves of Fahvanosy, whose ability to make even the dourest of meals at least somewhat palatable with just a few pinches of powder makes it a priority for even middling merchants, while the wealthy and powerful seek to acquire it in even greater quantities.\n\nJust trading in these cloves would bring us great wealth, but even greater riches could be had if we secure the so-called Sweetport, which serves as the primary trading hub for the spice traders in Fahvanosy."
 F23_seizing_the_sweetport_tt_1:0 "We will be able to use the Lizard Port of Teramzadai.\n"
 F23_seizing_the_sweetport_tt_2:0 "If a nation for a native Fahvanosy culture (Mazava, Mboala, Fomarati, and Amezatany Halflings, as well as Itayzemby Lizardfolk) has at least 150 opinion of us, we will pay §Y50§! less Diplomatic Power to complete this mission.

 F23_the_cloves_monopoly_desc:0 "Already, we are wealthy from trading in cloves, with our control of the Sweetport allowing us to streamline the cloves trade and charge even higher sums for the spice.\n\nThere is no reason to stop there, however. If we can ensure that all clove production rests in the hands of us and reduce the costs of transporting cloves to new markets in Haless, we can charge even higher prices!"

 F23_safe_sarhali_seas_desc:0 "Most empires control large swathes of territory, but as the accursed Jaher's Phoenix Empire has shown, such empires are vulnerable and may shatter swiftly in periods of uncertainty. Thus, ours will be different. We shall not set out to seize large swathes of land local demagogues might be able to rally against us, but shall instead conquer the sea and the shipping lanes.\n\nBy controlling the southern Sarhali seas and ensuring that we have well-developed trading outposts in strategic positions, we will be able to profit far more than if we had fought expensive wars of mass conquest against the locals."

 F23_the_path_to_haless_desc:0 "Haless. We have known about this continent for millennia, but have seldom had much interaction with them. Before the Golden Highway was built, the trek through the Salahad Desert was a treacherous one, and even after Jaher bound Bulwar and Haless more tightly together, our focus was on maritime trade in Divenhal, rather than sending caravans across the Salahad Desert.\n\nThanks to our trade outposts across southern Sarhal, however, our merchants can make the journey to Haless without venturing across the scorching sands, but can instead use our trading posts to go south of Sarhal.\n\nHowever, the region of Ardimya proves a significant obstacle to journey all the way to Haless, greatly increasing shipping costs for those who do not simply sell their goods to local middlemen. The Strongbellow Society, however, has been badgered into having a look at the situation, and believe that it may be possible to construct a canal to bypass Ardimya - albeit at a significant cost."

 F23_the_copper_seaway_desc:0 "Centuries ago, Jaher's empire was bound together through the Golden Highway. While it was built to facilitate armies and administrators, the Highway also saw merchants bass between Haless and Bulwar in numbers unimaginable before Phoenix Empire.\n\nHowever, for all the splendour and wonder of the Golden Highway, crossing from Bulwar to Haless still requires venturing through a desert, where water is scarce and freight expensive. Much better is the path we have wrought: one built not from golden brick and mortar, but forged from a series of trading posts and well-patrolled sea lanes.\n\nThe Copper Seaway.\n\nThis seaborne path of ours connects not just Bulwar and Haless, but also includes the Divenhal and Sarhal, allowing goods, people, and ideas to travel swifter, safer, and in greater numbers from one end of Halcann to the other than ever thought possible."

 F23_a_silverforge_visitor_title:0 "A Silverforge Visitor"
 F23_a_silverforge_visitor_desc:0 "Thanks to the distance between Silverforge and Ovdal Tûngr and our differing interests, we have little competition, and can thus bond over shared cultural ties without letting other tensions get in the way.\n\nThanks to this, it is hardly uncommon for Silver Dwarves to visit us, or vice versa.

While it was indeed the Phoenix Empire which maintained the Copper Enclosure and caused us so much suffering, they did not maintain it purely of their own accord.\n\nNo, preserved official correspondence and documentation has shown that Seghdihr - doubtless out of jealousy of the influence we once wielded in Bulwar, and fearful that we might regain it - offered the Phoenix Empire lucrative trade deals, were they to maintain the blockade on our hold.\n\nSuch treachery must be repaid!"
