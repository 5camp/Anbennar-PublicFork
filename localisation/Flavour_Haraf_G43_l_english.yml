 #Events 
 haraf_events.1.t:0 "Da'kino's Decree"
 haraf_events.1.d:0 "It is a cool and dry dawn that greets Da'kino as he exits his home. Four Harafe men await eagerly for his presence at the roaring bonfire in the center of Nani Kinn - the flaming heart that burns for every meeting of the five great House chiefs. "My Chief Alas'gasidi," barks the Datai'tsel chief in an awkward salute. "We have all journeyed many days for this meeting. My people require me to lead the upcoming raid, so let us-" "Yes - let us speak on why I have summoned you all here," Da'kino interrupts. "Rather, allow me to speak, lest you forget who speaks for the Houses." A brief, uneasy silence fills the air. It is permeated only by the ever-present crackling and heat of the bonfire, and scent of woodsmoke. "For all my life, I have been troubled by the feuds of our Houses; by the wars of our fathers and our fathers' fathers. I have tried to mend our differences, to live as we did in the days of Tselayos, but I realize now that it is impossible if the Alas'gasidi remain as first among equals," Da'kino laments. "The inane cycle of the Houses' wars and upheavals perpetuated by the decadent and shortsighted Harafe of ages past must perish and in its place will rise an eternal, prosperous land - and I will lead you all to it." There is a momentary pause. "I have summoned you all to declare that the antiquated rule of the old Harafe ends now," booms Da'kino. "In my name and of all the gods' and Paragons', I, and the Alas'gasidi, will be considered foremost among the Houses. Not only guardians and mediators of the Houses, but governors and rulers, as well," A fervor matching that of the bonfire's flaming heart and the dawn's rising sun swells now in Da'kino's words. "Who will declare themselves to be in disaccord and known as traitors to the Harafe? As thieves of a tranquil life to your future kin? As nothing but a single, sour note in the songs of the Singers? Speak now." The four chiefs all stand but do not speak. All except the Keiin'achi chief, who offers only a dire remark before departing: "If you wish to rule the Flame-Born, you will prove you have the strength to take it!" And so the first oaths of allegiance are sworn. Either believing in Da'kino's vision, fearing the repercussions of refusal, or elements of both - the chiefs of Houses Alas'gasidi, Datai'tsel, Leeti'haàt, and Hoila'kosu all join in binding accord; to realize Da'kino's nascent ambition."

 haraf_events.2.t:0 "Taming the Sandworm"
 haraf_events.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] and his entourage arrive in Leeti'haàt lands, marked by dunes of sand slowly replacing the dry grasslands they are accustomed to. After the expected reception by the Leeti'haàt chief, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is led on a tour of the desert settlement and eventually intrigued by the tamed collection of giant, burrowing worms native to the Haraf desert. "Ah, I see you have a curious eye for the sandworms,"" says the Leeti'haàt chief. "I must admit, even after all these years living among them, I still find them as majestic as when I was a boy. Magnificent gifts of Ek'elas, they are." A reminiscent smile decorates the chief's face as [Root.Monarch.GetName] shifts his attention from the sandworms to the chief. "I wish to ride one of them," states [Root.Monarch.GetName], plainly. The smile on the chief's face suddenly spreads into an ecstatic look of glee as he hears the words. "I thought you'd never ask, my Chief Alas'gasidi!"" Several minutes pass as [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s chosen sandworm is readied and he stands atop it. "My Chief Alas'gasidi, I must insist you ride one of the smaller sandworms for your first attempt! This one is much too large and ornery for a beginner!" "No need to worry, my Chief Leeti'haàt! If I can wrangle the Harafe, I can handle a measly worm!" boasts [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As if in protest, the sandworm charges ahead as the chief struggles to resist the worm's attempts to throw him off. At last, [Root.Monarch.GetName] sinks his wormhooks into the beast and is able to steer it back towards the settlement. A cheering crowd awaits the Chief Alas'gasidi as he returns and the Chief Leeti'haàt receives him. "Amazing! Such a large worm broken in so quickly, it would be a shame to not offer him to the one who has bested him! All that he requires now is a name. My Chief Alas'gasidi?""
