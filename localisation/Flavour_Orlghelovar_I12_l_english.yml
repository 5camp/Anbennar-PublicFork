 flavor_orlghelovar.101.t:0 "Glass of Orlghelovar"
 flavor_orlghelovar.101.d:0 "The mood within Orlghelovar is subdued, despite our recent great reawakening - the glassworkers are growing unsatisfied with their craft. While it is undeniable that our glassworkers are the finest, it has always been this way - they have not truly innovated or been challenged for many generations, and their passions are beginning to cool. For the first time since our ancestors began making glass, we can see new scientific possibilities on the horizon.  Our gnomish scientists have already made great leaps in the study of other materials, and with their assistance we may gain a deeper understanding of glass. We must gather our greatest glassworkers and our finest minds to search for new ideas - with one spark we could revitalise the whole industry forever."
 flavor_orlghelovar.101.a:0 "Glass is the way forward!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.102.t:0 "Trader's Advice"
 flavor_orlghelovar.102.d:0 "During a meeting with the most prominent Orlghelovarian glass traders, a radical idea was proposed - what about examining glass from outside the Serpentspine? Many in Orlghelovar decry glassworkers from other nations as backwards and misguided, but for these reasons we have never bothered to ask how they do it. Early reports from a trader loyal to us within a Bulwari glass manufactory suggest their proprietary methods are quite different to ours, and the methods used in Cannor to produce vast quantities of glass are completely opaque to us. From this, it is clear that to truly become the masters of glass, we must incorporate all discoveries in glassmaking! No matter how primitive the glassworkers of the world outside the Serpentspine are, their techniques are still alien to us - researching these may be the spark our glassworkers need to truly perfect their craft."
 flavor_orlghelovar.102.a:0 "Maybe the surface knows."

 flavor_orlghelovar.103.t:0 "The Outside Glass"
 flavor_orlghelovar.103.d:0 "Our information gathering has borne fruit - from the myriad proprietary techniques of Halann's glassworkers we have identified two distinct underlying methods. We have tentatively named these the "Bulwari" and "Cannorian" methods, after the location of the glassworks using them. These methods are the secret to the unique nature of each region's glass, and by analysing these we may glean the results of the many years of experimentation their workers have benefited from. However, such an endeavour will doubtlessly take yet more time - many variations on these methods are used by glassworkers of variable skill, producing glass of greatly varying quality even within each region. These extant techniques must be analysed and the merit of each determined, so that we may combine them all to produce the perfect product. /n/nWe will begin with the Bulwari. Not only are their glassworks closer in proximity to our own, but we have much stronger relations with them than the Cannorians. Furthermore, as the Bulwari were the first to learn of glassmaking from our ancestors their glassmaking should be the most similar to ours - though of course, incomparable in quality."
 flavor_orlghelovar.103.a:0 "Bulwar was choosen by our ancestors for a reason."

 flavor_orlghelovar.104.t:0 "The Glass of Bulwar"
 flavor_orlghelovar.104.d:0 "It seems our prejudice against other glassworkers may have some merit - the glass produced by the Bulwari method cannot hold a candle to ours, even when the method is performed by our own superior craftsmen. Their methods are simply too clumsy and wasteful, borne of an abundance of resources and the near monopoly they enjoyed after our hold was first ravaged. However, within them we can see the designs of our ancestors shining through and though their methods have been diluted by many generations of Bulwari craftsmen, their glassmaking still bears some resemblance to ours. They have clearly not forgotten our assistance in the past, as it is no coincidence their finest glassworks are those closest to Shazstundhir. Though we may have gleaned no new insights into glass, we can now more clearly picture how our ancestors once worked - but to venerate them properly, we must ensure their methods are carried out flawlessly. To this end, we will assist the Bulwari glassworkers once more so that they may create glass our ancestors can be satisfied with. \n\nPerhaps we will find better fortune studying the Cannorian method. We will need to make preparations to send a small contingent of glassworkers to Cannor, as we have had little luck convincing them to come to us."
 flavor_orlghelovar.104.a:0 "Hopefully Cannor will not disappoint"

 flavor_orlghelovar.105.t:0 "The Glass of Cannor"
 flavor_orlghelovar.105.d:0 "Once again, our glassworkers are disappointed! The Cannorian method invariably produces glass of even lower quality than the Bulwari and it is now clear that Halann needed the guiding hand of our ancestors to produce any semi-decent glass. Nothing useful at all can be gleaned from these methods, and many of our citizens are mourning that such a noble art can be performed so barbarically. Curiously, despite the lower quality of the glass produced their glassworkers are much happier and more motivated than ours, in part due to their more relaxed working conditions and standards. The trip was not entirely a waste, though - traders in Cannor are well aware of the lower quality of their glass and have often sought higher quality pieces. Once these traders laid eyes upon the Orlghelovarian glass we had brought with us to compare, our workers were inundated with offers of purchase - with more to come in the future!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.105.a:0 "At least we made money..."

 flavor_orlghelovar.106.t:0 "The End of the Trip"
 flavor_orlghelovar.106.d:0 "Our investigators have come together to summarise the results of our research into Halann's other glassworkers. As expected, we found no improvements or insights that will directly benefit us, as our artisans are simply too practised in their craft. However, we did learn more about what makes their glassworks so prosperous despite their inferior craftsmanship. \n\nThe Bulwari emphasise knowledge sharing and learning between craftsmen, and were particularly receptive both to ours and our ancestors' assistance with glassmaking. This attitude is sorely needed within our nation, as our glassworks have long since broken down into conglomerates - rather than our finest glassworkers working with each other and our less talented, they compete and vie with each other for prestige and wealth. This appears to be an affliction mostly limited to our dwarven artisans as our gnomish scientists are quite fanatical about cataloguing and sharing knowledge, having already produced a compendium of our finest inventions. If this fervour could be channelled into glassmaking, and our own artisans could be swept up into it, perhaps we could foster more co-operation within Orlghelovar."
 flavor_orlghelovar.106.a:0 "Cleared the future!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.107.t:0 "Glasslord Worker Reform"
 flavor_orlghelovar.107.d:0 "Orlghelovar has been reborn anew, and our people are emboldened by our success over the hoardcursed who had slowly come to control most of our nation. Already, there are calls for even more sweeping reforms to workers rights - particularly within the glass industry, as it is both our most important and most venerated profession. With the assistance of Orlghelovar's gnomish scientists and finest advisors, we have distilled all of the research we previously conducted into Halann's glassworks and the lessons learnt from the hoardcurse into the most ambitious set of reforms ever attempted in our nation. \n\nFirstly, the glass industry will no longer be controlled by a select few. As a cornerstone of our economy, society, and culture, it is essential to Orlghelovar and thus will be nationalised and completely owned by our administration. No longer will profits be syphoned into the pockets of the owners at the expense of the common worker. All profits from glass will be fed back into the state to fund our projects directly, and workers will receive a proportional and untaxed share of these profits, ensuring they are both incentivised to and can benefit from increased production. With the corrupt owners gone, we can standardise glass production, allowing many of the unreasonable standards and targets for glassworks to be lifted. We must be careful to prevent our workers falling into repetitive dullness, and so we will also allow the glassworkers more personal freedom to choose how and what glass they produce, so long as it meets our quality standards. \n\nWe will also foster a combination of both competition and co-operation in our workers. We will greatly incentivise the sharing of knowledge between glassworks, and sponsor artisans to lead regular workshops for our glassworkers to improve their craft. We will make leading positions within glassworks only available to those who can win a majority vote of confidence from the workers. This will both improve cohesion in the glassworks and foster healthy competition between individual workers, which will drive them to produce glass of yet greater quality. \n\nAs expected, these proposals are vehemently opposed by those they aim to deprive of power - a small but extremely influential cabal of top glasswork owners and traders who our people have dubbed the "glasslords". Despite the reforms instituted in Orlghelovar to crush monopolies and remove corruption, many of them maintained most of their power and influence by utilising their position as leaders in our foremost industry. As is common within the upper circles of dwarf kind, they are motivated only by greed and abhor change in any form. Already we have seen threats both economic and of violence as a response, and as we move forward with these reforms they will only grow bolder. Many within our nation feel that armed rebellion is an inevitability, and that the only question is when they will make their move. Our citizens have already seen the destructive effects of infighting and tire of conflict between our brethren. Thus, we must be prepared to swiftly crush any such attempts by the glasslords maintain the stability of our nation."
 flavor_orlghelovar.107.a:0 "Nothing will stand in the way of progress!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.108.t:0 "Incident at the Glassworks"
 flavor_orlghelovar.108.d:0 "As our reforms near completion, the glasslords dissent and anger have grown to precipitous levels. They have whipped our workers up into a fury with propaganda and empty promises, and have organised strikes and protests at all of our glassworks simultaneously. To attempt to restore peace, we sent officials to each glasswork to reiterate our stance for workers rights, but made the grave error of providing them with a small armed escort. At our glassworks in [Root.Capital.GetName] one of their guards overreacted, and swung at a particularly threatening worker - quickly, the protests devolved into a violent brawl, and our official barely escaped with their life. News of this incident spread, amplified by the glasslords, and now the protests have turned into open rebellion at every glassworks! We must act swiftly to protect our industry and put these rebellions down."
 flavor_orlghelovar.108.a:0 "Violence can not stop us."

 flavor_orlghelovar.109.t:0 "The End of the Reform"
 flavor_orlghelovar.109.d:0 "Today, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has gathered a great crowd of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] citizens under the balcony in the forum of [Root.Capital.GetName] for a grand announcement. \n\n"Citizens of Orlghelovar" [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] bellows, "The glassworker reforms are finally complete! For the first time, every glassworker in every glassworks has been afforded the privileges and rights they deserve. In doing this, we have surpassed even our ancestors!". Before the crowd can celebrate, he continues "However, this joy is not felt in every corner of the nation. The glasslords have been quiet since their disastrous protests and many have gone into hiding, as you well know. I am told that once news of our accomplishment reached them, they drew all of their remaining wealth and influence to mount a final stand against the forces of progress, going as far as to hire mercenaries to support their rebellion from our neighbouring countries! As I speak, they march on [Root.Capital.GetName]". [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] pauses, letting the crowd murmur and shift, before quieting them with a gesture. Another moment, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] voice rings out "It is clear that they will never be satisfied with any world in which they are not in control, and so to safeguard the future of our nation we must purge them once and for all. For the future of Orlghelovar, we must take up arms once more!". At this, [Root.Monarch.GetName] turns and strides from the balcony to the sound of raucous cheering and cries for glasslord blood behind him - the last hurdle of these reforms is upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 flavor_orlghelovar.109.a:0 "The Glasslords were a pain long enough"

 flavor_orlghelovar.110.t:0 "What is Glass?"
 flavor_orlghelovar.110.d:0 "Under the guidance of the Enlightened 10, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] was granted a sizable sum and some of our best gnomish scientists to make use of all our recent scientific breakthroughs and discover exactly what glass is. Today, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has presented [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings to the council. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] has discovered that there is much more variation in glass than we thought! Although most glass is made of the same primary material, silica, there is great variation in the structure of even visually similar glass. There are also many impurities in the glass we produce, even in pieces we thought to be near perfect. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] also studied a range of naturally occurring glass and discovered other similarities, claiming that even volcanic obsidian shares some properties with ordinary glass! With this research, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has made several breakthroughs that will directly affect how we produce glass. \n\nIn [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] study of silica, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] determined that different types of sand will produce different glass. Many artisans believed that any sand could be used to produce identical glass with varying effort, and thus no provisions were made to standardise what sand is used in our glassworks. Upon analysing sand from Bahar and from the Dameshead, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] discovered that though they are both comprised mostly of silica they each have different levels of impurities that cannot be removed by simple sifting and filtering - these are the cause of much of the variation between regional glass. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] also identified some inexpensive materials which can be added while heating to remove many of these impurities, as well as some that improve other properties like tensile strength or corrosion resistance. With this revelation we can produce better specialised glass for different uses, no longer will we use the same method to produce glass for a window and glass for a heating flask! \n\n[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] also examined the processes used in our glassworks with [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] new knowledge of the structure of glass. Ordinarily, glassworkers lay molten glass to cool on great sheets of solid iron. Glass cooled this way is often uneven and always blemishes on the side touching the iron and so must be polished after the cooling is complete, wasting both time and material. On the suggestion of a gnomish scientist with experience in metallurgy, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] devised a new method where molten glass "floats" upon a bed of molten metal to cool. If the metal chosen is one that will not mix with molten glass, such as tin, then the glass formed will be perfectly smooth and unblemished without any polishing. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] has also drawn up a set of quality assurance tests to perform on our glass. These tests are extensive, going beyond the simple hammer and eye methods of our ancestors. In particular, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has devised an ingenious use of polarised light, which will display coloured streaks in any glass with remaining impurities. These tests will ensure our glass is of sufficient quality, but also allow us to quantify exactly what properties our glass has to better market it to our customers."
 flavor_orlghelovar.110.a:0 "Such splendid information!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.111.t:0 "A Clear Future"
 flavor_orlghelovar.111.d:0 "The atmosphere in Orlghelovar is electric. The culmination of cutting-edge research and radical worker reforms has elevated our glass production far above anything seen anywhere in Halann. Yet our citizens do not rest on their laurels! Our workers are productive and competent, yet also happy and artistically fulfilled. Our glassworks are co-operating, producing a never ending stream of higher and higher quality glass. Our scientists still toil to improve glass production ever further, and with them our position at the scientific forefront of Halann grows too. All marvel at what we have achieved in just a few short centuries since our reawakening, and none will ever match us in glass again!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.111.a:0 "Now we are the true masters of glass!"

 #Light Events      written by Grymhar
 flavor_orlghelovar.112.t:0 "a"
 flavor_orlghelovar.112.d:0 "It’s not all that difficult to turn magic into light: fire produces a lot of light, and it is very easy to create a lot of fire with only a little bit of damestear. What fire also produces, however, is heat, smoke, ash, and grime. What we need is a more pure light. In order to achieve this, our artificers are not heating up flammable material, but very small amounts of a metal alloy. Being heated to just under its melting point by the damestear, the alloy produces a very large amount of light. Besides allowing the damestear to last much longer, this also produces no smoke or grime, meaning that the devices do not need to be cleaned to retain their shine. The only problem now is that the individual devices are the size of a dwarf, and therefore very expensive."
 flavor_orlghelovar.112.a:0 "Brilliant progress!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.113.t:0 "Innovation of Light"
 flavor_orlghelovar.113.d:0 "After a lot of iterations, our artificers and engineers have produced the final version of the lighting device. Stripped down to its barest essentials, the conical design is no larger than a lantern, and produces vastly more light. The top can be screwed out to access the damestear core, pre-cut in a rectangular shape to be easy to replace. They are now being installed throughout our holdings in the Serpentreach, illuminating the long trade routes under the mountains."
 flavor_orlghelovar.113.a:0 "Light the way!"

 #Magic Events      written by Gyrmhar
 flavor_orlghelovar.114.t:0 "Magical Research"
 flavor_orlghelovar.114.d:0 "Magic is a difficult topic to study. While artificery is able to manifest quite a bit, it is often more through reproduction and iteration of spells than by invention. In other words: while we often know *how* magic works, we rarely know *why* it works. It limits its use on a very fundamental level. And at the core of it, of course, is gib azhaln, what the Cannorians know as damestear. It empowers our runes, and in turn, our artefacts. Beyond this, it is the primary driving force behind the power of the mages, who by and large are unaccountable and virtually impossible to regulate. For this reason, we intend to fund much more research into gib azhaln itself."
 flavor_orlghelovar.114.a:0 "Start at the source!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.115.t:0 "The Gib Azhaln Tax"
 flavor_orlghelovar.115.d:0 "Following reports that the research into gib azhaln is straining due to a lack of supply, our researchers have petitioned the High Council to step in. If they have to keep working at this pace, they claim, research is going to take several lifetimes. Attempts to import gib azhaln from abroad have resulted in very little, and existing deposits cannot be effectively mined faster without serious safety risks. In order to secure the large amounts of gib azhaln we need, they request that we limit its use for other projects: by levying a harsh tax on the use of gib azhaln for purposes not related to research, they claim, we can ensure the supply remains large enough for the quantities needed for research."
 flavor_orlghelovar.115.a:0 "I suppose it is necessary."

 flavor_orlghelovar.116.t:0 "A minor Issue"
 flavor_orlghelovar.116.d:0 "There is a degree of discontent over the gib azhaln tax, as those mages and artificers who cannot afford the higher prices complain they cannot do their work. Arguments that their work may be much improved if the research is allowed to continue do little to sway them. Ultimately, however, they are few in number and influence and are as such easy to ignore."
 flavor_orlghelovar.116.a:0 "We stay our course."

 flavor_orlghelovar.117.t:0 "Rising Price"
 flavor_orlghelovar.117.d:0 "While research into gib azhaln is progressing well enough, the discontent with the tax has been festering and growing. Even those wealthier mages and artificers chafe at the costs they have to incur for their projects, and in turn, so do their customers. The situation is starting to turn serious."
 flavor_orlghelovar.117.a:0 "We will have to ask our researchers to hurry… "

 flavor_orlghelovar.118.t:0 "Revolution of Magic"
 flavor_orlghelovar.118.d:0 "We face open revolt. Nearly every institution in the country associated in any way with magic has banded together in opposition to the tax on gib azhaln, with many more laying down their tools in solidarity with them. With the research nowhere near done yet, we cannot afford to wait it out any longer. We have to act now."
 flavor_orlghelovar.118.a:0 "We may have miscalculated…"

 flavor_orlghelovar.119.t:0 "The Place of Mages"
 flavor_orlghelovar.119.d:0 "At long last, we have brought our institutions to heel. One thing has become very clear, however: the status quo is tainted, and cannot continue. Our advisors, however, disagree vehemently about what exactly needs to change. Some demand retribution: the mages were fundamentally disloyal to Orlghelovar, and should not expect to be welcome still. They should be exiled for what they have done. Others, however, argue quite the opposite. The protests and the rebellion have shown just how reliant we actually are on the mages. We should elevate their position above the scientists, and ensure that we are not put into this position again. A small number of advisors, however, see a third path. They believe the root of the problem lies in the division between the scientists and the mages, and want to restructure the council on a fundamental level. Research and practice of magic, they argue, must intertwine, lest we either lose sight of progress or lose our grounding in reality. This final proposal is broadly viewed as utopian and unachievable, especially now that there is already bad blood between these groups."
 flavor_orlghelovar.119.a:0 "We will elevate the position of the mages"
 flavor_orlghelovar.119.b:0 "The mages will face exile."
 flavor_orlghelovar.119.c:0 "We will attempt the ‘impossible’"

 flavor_orlghelovar.120.t:0 "Grudges of Mages"
 flavor_orlghelovar.120.d:0 "Our decision to elevate the position of the mages has had some unfortunate consequences. While we have certainly achieved the civil stability we wanted, the mages often take advantage of their new status to obstruct our researchers, settling personal grudges, and leverage more privileges for themselves."
 flavor_orlghelovar.120.a:0 "We’ll rein them in again over time… "

 flavor_orlghelovar.121.t:0 "The Importance of Mages"
 flavor_orlghelovar.121.d:0 "Our decision to elevate the position of the mages has had some unfortunate consequences. While it certainly put an end to the unrest, our population still has a now unmet demand for their services, which our artificers have as of yet not been able to fill. As of yet, artificery remains expensive, and is therefore not a realistic alternative to the less affluent who until now relied on simple rune magic. "
 flavor_orlghelovar.121.a:0 "I’m sure we’ll solve this in time."

 flavor_orlghelovar.122.t:0 "Progess gained Hand in Hand"
 flavor_orlghelovar.122.d:0 "Despite all the doubters, we have achieved what was thought impossible. The mages have been integrated as a proper part of our researchers, with the new position of mage supervisor in the council. This mage supervisor is elected by the most powerful and renowned mages of the realm, and is in charge of the practical applications of magical research. The mutual mistrust has been replaced by a friendly rivalry, as researchers and mages both endeavour to contribute to the filling of our libraries with new magical knowledge. "
 flavor_orlghelovar.122.a:0 "And they are learning so much from one another."

 #####Missions#####
 #####Part 1#####
 orlghelovar_recruit_great_minds_title:0 "Recruit great Minds"
 orlghelovar_recruit_great_minds_desc:0 "With our recent refoundation of Orlghelovar we faced a certain issue. Dwarfs from all over Halann do not want to join us and we are lacking in forward thinking people. Extensive planning has to be done for us to become a major country in the world and for that we need everyone we can get. Let us pay handsomely for experts to join us."

 orlghelovar_expand_production_title:0 "Expand Production"
 orlghelovar_expand_production_desc:0 "It was decided that we should focus on the same thing as the orlghelovaric dwarfs of old. Trade was and always will be important for us and to have a successful trading empire we need to increase our production in different parts of our country in order to open our markets and to not collapse from it."

 orlghelovar_not_so_britle_anymore_title:0 "Not so brittle anymore"
 orlghelovar_not_so_britle_anymore_desc:0 "Our new home is as brittle as glass. Being a surface hold has its advantages, like easy acces to lucrative trading routes. But the main disadvantage is the constant fear of being invaded from the outside. We need to fortify Orlghelovar to keep it safe forever more."

 orlghelovar_restore_the_glassworks_title:0 "Restore the Glassworks"
 orlghelovar_restore_the_glassworks_desc:0 "With our production increasing in our country and Orlghelovar secured, we can finally start to focus on what we can do best, glass. Orlghelovar was known as a hold of great wealth through trading in glass. Our hold has to be expanded and reclaimed from what it once was for us to start production at a fraction of what our ancestors were once capable of."

 orlghelovar_cobalt_not_only_in_name_title:0 "Cobalt not only in Name"
 orlghelovar_cobalt_not_only_in_name_desc:0 "When reclaiming Orlghelovar we located a massive mining structure right next to the hold. When we dug further it became apparent it was the ancient cobalt mine of Orlghelovar which gave the dwarfs from the hold their name. Our advisors incentivised us to restart the mining in that mine."

 orlghelovar_combinations_of_glass_title:0 "Combinations of Glass"
 orlghelovar_combinations_of_glass_desc:0 "With the cobalt mine reclaimed and restarted we should try to recreate the trademark of our ancestors, a blue coloured glass with cobalt pigments. We know for certainty it can be done but we can not quite manage to reproduce it. We will need new tools made of sturdy diamonds to create the necessary tools."

 orlghelovar_crystal_experts_title:0 "Crystal Experts"
 orlghelovar_crystal_experts_desc:0 "Old maps indicate that Arg-Ôrdstun is close by. It is a hold known for its defiance against Aul-Dwarov and its gigantic mines. Reclaiming it in our name would be a prestigious act and would also give us access to new possibilities within the Serpentreach."

 orlghelovar_marble_experts_title:0 "Marble Experts"
 orlghelovar_marble_experts_desc:0 "In the south of Orlghelovar lies another abandoned Hold named Shazstundihr. In the days of old it was known for its impressive buildings made out of marble. Even though the building technique is most likely gone forever we can use it as a strategic outpost in our growing realm and therefore should reclaim it as well."

 orlghelovar_stabilze_our_reign_title:0 "Stabilize our Reign"
 orlghelovar_stabilze_our_reign_desc:0 "As it turned out Arg-Ôrdstun never fell in the greentide and instead was a remnant hold. They never lost their defiant spirit but instead it only grew stronger. We currently face the same problem Aul-Dwarov most likely faced with them but we can use the situation to our advantage. If we show them our generous support in rebuilding their home they will surely become more attuned with our goals and accept our reign over them."

 orlghelovar_new_trading_partners_title:0 "New Trading Partners"
 orlghelovar_new_trading_partners_desc:0 "With Shazstundhir and Arg-Ôrdstun reclaimed we can start peeking outwards to our allies of old. The countries in Bulwar were historic trading partners with Orlghelovar as can still be seen in their ancient structures where they used our iconic cobalt glass. But no country of the old days still exists, only new fractured states in permanent infighting between humans and elves. We should not interfere in the politics of the region but instead become friends with both sides to always come out on top."

 orlghelovar_first_steps_title:0 "First Steps"
 orlghelovar_first_steps_desc:0 "With the reclamation of Shazstundhir finalized we can start using its strategic position. It is the western gateway from the Serpentspine into Bulwar and situated close to Bahari ports and trade routes. We should start building up our own trade posts close to those routes to also start profiting from our location and our goods."

 orlghelovar_impress_bulwar_thinkers_title:0 "Impress Bulwar"
 orlghelovar_impress_bulwar_thinkers_desc:0 "Although constantly in war and in religious instability, Bulwar offers opportunities. Wars create brilliant personalities and thinkers. Ancient elves with their immense knowledge gathered through their long lives, even for dwarven standards. We need to show some of those great minds our support through art and our prestige, that will be carried by our traders in bulwar, that we are a country worth supporting."

 orlghelovar_reclaiming_our_name_title:0 "Reclaiming our Name"
 orlghelovar_reclaiming_our_name_desc:0 "Our Reclamation efforts are running at an ever increasing speed. Since our start as a small adventurer band to explore the Serpentreach we came much further then we expected. Our new home is growing by the day. We need more space for our people and more buildings. We need to train a new army for protection for we know there are still dangerous shadows lurking in the dark."

 orlghelovar_resurgence_of_a_legacy_title:0 "Resurgence of a Legacy"
 orlghelovar_resurgence_of_a_legacy_desc:0 "Through various efforts we succeeded in creating a new home for dwarves all over the world. Not only did we secure our holdings but we also stepped into our ancestors footsteps by starting trade with Bulwar. We should finalize this chapter and create a historic moment for Orlghelovar."


 #####Part 2#####
 orlghelovar_diamonds_and_glass_title:0 "Diamonds and Glass"
 orlghelovar_diamonds_and_glass_desc:0 "Glass is a hard material to work with. We have perfected it either way, but that does not mean we stop searching for new methods and tools. A diamond is the hardest thing we know, maybe the dwarfs in Arg-Ordstun can develop something with it. A material can only be cut with something harder, therefore diamonds might be the best cutting tool."

 orlghelovar_increase_demand_for_diamonds_title:0 "Increased Diamond Demand"
 orlghelovar_increase_demand_for_diamonds_desc:0 "Glass is our main trade, but we do not neglect our other goods. Our most recently developed tool, diamond cutting tools, are low in supply. Demands can not be satisfied by the raw diamond supply of the mines near Arg-Orgstun. It is therefore our duty as a cobalt dwarf to mine those diamonds for our glassworkers!"

 orlghelovar_diamond_quarry_title:0 "The Diamond Quarry"
 orlghelovar_diamond_quarry_desc:0 "The Diamond Quarry, as the name suggests, is famous for its sheer amounts of diamonds. It’s almost like a never ending supply of diamonds, just waiting for us to mine them and use them for our needs. Since our demand for diamonds went up quite significantly, we should invest in the local mining structures and expand it to prevent shortages."

 orlghelovar_integrate_baharkandis_ways_title:0 "Integrate Baharkandi"
 orlghelovar_integrate_baharkandis_ways_desc:0 "Right outside of Shazstundihr’s borders lies the now partially devastated realm of Baharkand. Though not a dwarf state or integrated into Aul-Dwarov at any point in history, its significance to us now is remarkable. In current times, the coast of said realm was known as ‘Gulf of Glass’, not only for its beauty but also for its big glass production. The methods they use originate back from our ancestors and they made it their own tradition. While this makes us happy to see the work of our ancestors pay off, we have to consider them as serious rivals for common glass and therefore fully integrate their production into our hands if we want to dominate the glass market in Bulwar."

 orlghelovar_make_partners_depended_title:0 "Make Partners Depended"
 orlghelovar_make_partners_depended_desc:0 "The dwarfs of Ovdal Tungir have proven themselves to be reliable trade partners. They deeply trust us and share their knowledge on a local and a state level. That allowed our merchant spies to easily access crucial information for the Tungeric economy. With enough money we could essentially buy those industries and make them dependent on our economy, essentially revoking their freedom in the process."

 orlghelovar_warding_gate_title:0 "The Warding Gate"
 orlghelovar_warding_gate_desc:0 "In ancient times there was the hold of Verkal Skomdihr. Not only known for their crafts but also for their geographical position. Right outside the hold is a dense forest where the Fey reside in and cause mischief in and outside the forest. To protect against this, they constructed the Warding Gate, blocking the Feys' powers and entries into Aul-Dwarov, but with the fall of the dwarven empire we fear the gate could be wrongly maintained with unknown consequences. Even with the technology required to restore the gate lost in time, we should secure that important position in the Serpentreach."

 orlghelovar_unexplored_wilderness_title:0 "An Unexplored Wilderness"
 orlghelovar_unexplored_wilderness_desc:0 "To our surprise, it seems different races live inside what apparently is named the “Deepwoods”. We received intelligence of elves living inside that region fighting against orcs and goblins just like us. We should lend them a helping hand and reach out to one of those elf countries inside the Deepwoods. Maybe we could make arrangements for a mutually beneficial deal?"

 orlghelovar_gain_new_partners_title:0 "Gain New Partners"
 orlghelovar_gain_new_partners_desc:0 "With our network of diplomatic relations formed on the outside, we can start to look inside the Serpentspine. We are not the only dwarfs inside the spine and many other adventures set off to reclaim it in the name of our ancestors and hold remnants of Aul-Dwarov who survived the Last Days. All of them could be potentially beneficial partners to strengthen our position towards other powers inside and outside the Serpentspine."

 orlghelovar_with_trade_comes_knowledge_title:0 "Trading Knowledge"
 orlghelovar_with_trade_comes_knowledge_desc:0 "When we asked ourselves what we could do to impress the gnomes, we came to the conclusion to impress them through innovations and a strong state. But how could we create such a state in the first place? Cobalt Dwarves all over Orlghelovar argued about that and after a considerable amount of time a solution was found. The Glasshammer fair shows innovations in glassmaking from all over the world. So if we would use our vast network of trading partners and traders all over Cannor and Bulwar, we could use specialists as spies. For that we need to elevate merchants all over Orlghelovar into high ranks to encourage a beneficial position for our state and for them and ensure their loyalty to us."

 orlghelovar_taking_revenge_title:0 "Taking Revenge"
 orlghelovar_taking_revenge_desc:0 "We will never forget what the orcs and the goblins did to our ancestors. If one is to look outwards of Orlghelovar, we can see a domain of goblins right outside our borders. We would normally not care to go out of our way to deal with them but they are a nuisance to our potential growth into the growing trade of the Divenhal and especially cannorian trade."

 orlghelovar_baseless_crusade_title:0 "A Baseless Crusade"
 orlghelovar_baseless_crusade_desc:0 "Once we cleared out the goblins outside of Orlghelovar, we started to face the next problem. We now border an ancient castanorian realm called Ourdia. Decadent and weak it lies in ruins of its former glory. While we don't have a reason to conquer them directly, we need to own the region for our trade to prosper. And since they are lost to fighting the goblins we might as well just take their land while cleaning out goblins on the way."

 orlghelovar_glasshammer_fair_title:0 "The Glasshammer Fair"
 orlghelovar_glasshammer_fair_desc:0 "Our growing trade with cannor started to give us more benefits. With the ships from our newest partnership with Ovdal Tungir, we started trading heavily with big cities in the Empire of Anbennar, especially in Anbenncóst. Recently we were approached with a great idea by a family of glass traders named ‘Glasshammer’. Proud cobalt dwarfs and traders by heart, they want to show off the glory of orlghelovaric glass in all of Cannor. For that they requested *insert Ruler* to invest in traders spreading the glory of our ancestors glass in cannor to increase demands for our highly valuable glass. They would pay for everything related to the actual event which they would hold yearly called ‘The Glasshammer Fair’. The potential rewards are as limitless as the potential to expand it."

 orlghelovar_imperial_innovation_title:0 "Imperial Innovation"
 orlghelovar_imperial_innovation_desc:0 "When it comes to innovativeness there is one factor which is undoubtedly a main driving force for creating new inventions which is competition. One of the most competitive regions in that regard lies in the Empire of Anbennar. Every state within its border is trying to increase its own influence and power, not necessarily through conquest, but rather by gaining an advantage in the technological field. We should harness their drive and support someone's ambition within the empire for his inventions while strengthening our own grip on one of the empire's core cities, Anbenncóst."

 orlghelovar_three_hold_consolidation_title:0 "Three Hold Consolidation"
 orlghelovar_three_hold_consolidation_desc:0 "The Caves in between the 3 holds need to be consolidated for safety purposes"

 orlghelovar_glass_to_divenhal_title:0 "Glass to the Divenhal"
 orlghelovar_glass_to_divenhal_desc:0 "Get a coast so trade can start again with cannor"

 orlghelovar_new_brothers_title:0 "New Brothers"
 orlghelovar_new_brothers_desc:0 "Ovdal Tungir has so many interactions with other countries but they allways end bad for some reason"

 orlghelovar_normal_sized_geniuses_title:0 "Normal sized Geniuses"
 orlghelovar_normal_sized_geniuses_desc:0 "In the Glasshammer fair there was one innovation visible to every attendee of the event. It wasn't a particular sort of glass or some embarrassing action of an ambassador but rather the people who helped organize it and gave some funds for a dedicated area. They were gnomes who showed off their newest inventions to the public. Not only was their presentation astonishing for us cobalt dwarfs but their ingenuity and will to research for a better tomorrow is what fascinated us. Our wealth and network and their intellect and innovations would make an amazing combination for the years to come. We need to reach out to a big gnomish country to make the necessary arrangements."

 orlghelovar_impress_gnomes_title:0 "Impress the Gnomes"
 orlghelovar_impress_gnomes_desc:0 "While our cooperation with the gnomes increases by the day, they are not nearly enough to have a sizable effect on our whole country. Integration and acceptance of local gnomes is still fairly low. If we want to convince our whole population of the sheer power we will gain by working with the gnomes, we will need to work on our own infrastructure and economy. Not only would our dwarfs be willing to accept the gnomes if they work on those projects, but it would also impress more gnomes to come and join our country solving both issues with one simple solution."

 orlghelovar_a_new_era_title:0 "A New Era"
 orlghelovar_a_new_era_desc:0 "Everything we did in the recent years was to build up for this day. Gnomes are integrated into the structure of our government and work as integral members of our society. Our internal restructuring can begin as we move towards a more scientific state like the Gnomish Hierarchy once was. Our future will be guided by science, supported by dwarfs and gnomes and built upon our ancestors' glass."


 #####Gor Burad Missions#####
 orlghelovar_end_of_serpentreach_title:0 "End of the Serpentreach"
 orlghelovar_end_of_serpentreach_desc:0 "According to the rumors of our brethren, we only need to follow Argrod to find the ruins of Gor Burad, a hold known for their extreme grudges even for us dwarves, lava and obsidian. They were the first to fall in the Greentide so it is unlikely to find any remnants unlike the dwarfs in Arg-Ordstun. But maybe we will find other remnants along the way?"

 orlghelovar_volcanic_glass_title:0 "Volcanic Glass"
 orlghelovar_volcanic_glass_desc:0 "Standing in front of the entrances of Gor Burad, one can imagine how they became the hotheads of us dwarves. Surrounded and partially destroyed by lava and the Greentide, we need to restore and reclaim it for our ancestors. Scouting teams around the area reported large amounts of obsidian around the hold. A perfect opportunity to give purpose to our newest reclaimed hold."

 orlghelovar_begin_excavations_title:0 "Beginn Exacations"
 orlghelovar_begin_excavations_desc:0 "Along the Argrod are several entrances into connected cave systems. Complicated paths filled with pesky goblins make it attractive to venture into them. However, recently there was news about a foundation of a rare material close to the entrance known as the zarnic breach. We should claim the cave system in our name and send an expedition team to investigate the rumors and establish exploitation possibilities."

 orlghelovar_release_vulcano_title:0 "Release the Vulcano"
 orlghelovar_release_vulcano_desc:0 "With many efforts and big investments, we were able to not only restore Gor Burad to his former glory but also to fundamentally restructure its purpose to serve our needs. The lava flow is integrated to help manufacture cheap glass in a unique way only possible with our glass making skills. The black rus from the lava and the ash causes the glass to gain a black shimmer which does not impact the view through the glass. We named it Obsidian Glass, as a memoir of the big obsidian industry also situated in Gor Burad."


 #####Research Missions#####
 orlghelovar_restructure_cobalt_mines_title:0 "Restructure the Cobalt Mines"
 orlghelovar_restructure_cobalt_mines_desc:0 "Looking into the future also involves looking into the past. If we would neglect our past we would neglect our own identity. We are called cobalt dwarfs for our blue glass and while our big mine is functional, it starts to show that it would not satisfy our ever increasing demands in the future. To prevent that, we should restructure the organization of the mining process and insure the usage of our ever growing knowledge about the world."

 orlghelovar_enact_enlightened_ten_title:0 "Enlightened Ten"
 orlghelovar_enact_enlightened_ten_desc:0 "In one of the first discussions about the future of Orlghelovar with the Gnomes, we discussed the role of the state in the future. “How should we guide the free minds of our researchers or should we just let them decide on their own?” was the main topic over many days of debate. After considerable time a solution was found. \n\nOrlghelovar will redirect every non-glass production in Orlghelovar to the people willing to research. It will be guided by a big newly built institute which can be used by everyone willing to learn. The most prestigious and most renowned of scientists can become part of the Enlightened, a council formed to look over the research from their fellow scientists and work in close cooperation with the state to incentivise and directly develop strategies for Orlghelovar. With this council enacted we can start creating research projects in which we will have great interest in."

 orlghelovar_expand_research_rooms_title:0 "Expand the Research Rooms"
 orlghelovar_expand_research_rooms_desc:0 "In time we could only finish a small part of our big institution. While functional for a small amount of research it does not even closely fulfill its purpose to serve as a place to research for every scientist. The rooms are lacking in equipment and space. There is also little possibility for habitation for hard working scientists. This is a problem of utmost priority to guarantee that we will stay ahead of everyone."

 orlghelovar_record_spoken_words_title:0 "Record spoken Words"
 orlghelovar_record_spoken_words_desc:0 "The most impactful weapon in life is information. It can change everything, a simple interaction, a deal be it of diplomatic or economic value or even a war. In cannor there are rumors of a potential invention which makes paper clear itself, making bureaucracy more cost efficient. This inspired our traders and some scientists to create something new based on this invention. A type of paper that can record anything said in close proximity to it and write it down. Simply carrying such a piece would be enough to gather an incredible amount of information. The idea and motivation is already in our possession. Now we only need to create a working version of this self-cleaning parchment."

 orlghelovar_new_trading_policiy_title:0 "New Trading Policy"
 orlghelovar_new_trading_policiy_desc:0 "Revoke the priviledge"

 orlghelovar_hire_experts_title:0 "Hire Experts"
 orlghelovar_hire_experts_desc:0 "If you want to become better, you have to learn and listen to the wise words of people. We want to improve our glassmaking but we are stuck. Everyone in Orlghelovar is a glass enthusiast and those working in the glass industry are masters at their craft, but we still do not reach the full potential of glass. We will need new ideas from highly renowned and skilled advisors to solve this issue."

 orlghelovar_clear_as_daylight_title:0 "Clear as Daylight"
 orlghelovar_clear_as_daylight_desc:0 "Our trader gave us valuable insight about glass industries in Halann which replaced our place in the world when Orlghelovar first fell. Naturally their skill does not surpass ours, otherwise we would have heard of their craftsmanship already, but they could offer valuable new perspectives for us to improve our skills."

 orlghelovar_codex_of_production_title:0 "Codex of Production"
 orlghelovar_codex_of_production_desc:0 "The glass facilities in Cannor showed us nothing of value in terms of how to create glass better. But what it showed us is that working conditions have an effect on the quantity and quality of the glass in more than one way. The natural habit of a dwarf is to hoard wealth and never share it. With this habit of our brethren it seems unlikely to ever change the condition of our glassworkers to increase our production efficiency. But once we get the opportunity for it we should try to push through any kind of rebellion we might face."

 orlghelovar_analysis_of_glass_title:0 "Analysis of Glass"
 orlghelovar_analysis_of_glass_desc:0 "Everyone in Halann knows glass. It is a material you can see through if the craftsmanship is sufficient and it can have multiple colors. Also it is fragile and shatters with minimal force. But that is not how we should look at glass. Recent studies showed that glass evolved with scientific progress and the potential is not yet reached. We should let the enlightened ten guide a lot of scientists towards understanding what exactly glass is in their eyes."

 orlghelovar_shatter_predjudice_title:0 "Shatter Predjudice"
 orlghelovar_shatter_predjudice_desc:0 "It is time to see our efforts come to fruition. We have faced many hardships to create this very moment. We only hope our ancestors smile upon us as they see us coming ever so close towards our skills of old. Glass and Orlghelovar will become synonyms in all of Halann once we are done with our reforms."

 orlghelovar_lay_ground_work_title:0 "Lay the Ground Work"
 orlghelovar_lay_ground_work_desc:0 "Finally the institute starts to show some progress. There are rooms for small projects and dedicated researchers but it is more of a temporary solution. There is little to no room for big projects or bigger projects. We have to lay the groundwork big enough for more scientists and projects then we could imagine. This includes the foundation of big dedicated areas which specialize in different areas of research."

 orlghelovar_magical_testing_title:0 "Magical Testing"
 orlghelovar_magical_testing_desc:0 "Parts of our newest addition to the institute are finished and they were immediately claimed by different groups of scientists. One of them was a big group directly led by one of the enlightened ten to study magic in depth. But rather than inventing new things they said they want to focus on writing down existing knowledge and in doing so increase the knowledge of magic in the whole institute. Such a valuable offer is rare and we have to capitalize on this."

 orlghelovar_finish_university_title:0 "Finish University"
 orlghelovar_finish_university_desc:0 "With an archive of magical knowledge finished and the construction of already planned segments of the institution finished, new plans for yet another addition were drafted. This time a spacious university, built to last the ages and keep knowledge of every invention produced in Orlghelovar safe. But we reached the limits of what our hold can reasonably support without damaging our glass industry. That means we have to reclaim more of our ancestral hold while constructing the university, all while gathering and creating records of inventions planned and already created within our borders."

 orlghelovar_magical_glass_title:0 "Magical Glass"
 orlghelovar_magical_glass_desc:0 "Our recent breakthrough in glass allowed our more creative scientists with invested interest in glass to start tinkering with new types of glass. Similar to alloys they wanted to mix the properties of different materials to create something of a mix. The most promising of them all is what they call “Magical Glass”. It is supposed to be a glass able to amplify magic in various ways through its magical properties. For that it uses very small quantities of Damestear in the smelting process. The idea and the blueprints shown before the council look promising enough that this should be supported by Orlghelovar. They only asked us to secure a steady supply of Damestear, either through trade or our own mines as the quality of the Damestear does not impact the production much."

 orlghelovar_safety_of_surface_desc:0 "We cannot flourish without establishing trade relations to sell our products to, but foreign merchants still avoid our lands. Many on the surface who oppose our rule threaten and harass any who would trade with us, frightening off even the most interested merchants away. We have to deal with these dissidents sooner rather than later, as every passing day steals potential profits from our coffers. "

 orlghelovar_enlightend_empire_desc:0 "With our nation pacified, we need to ensure the continuation of trade relations. The biggest obstacle for that is darkness. Our dwarven traders might be used to the oppressive darkness of the cavern and old railways between the holds, but human and elven traders dare not make these journeys with nothing but torches and lanterns to keep the dark at bay. If we are to make these trade routes accessible to the surface races, they need to be well-lit. That is where our artificers come in; they have been working on a new prototype lighting device, powered by a damestear core, that is able to produce light to pierce the darkness of the caverns of the Serpentreach. Now all that we need is working on making it affordable, durable, and long-lasting."

 orlghelovar_secure_damestear_supply_title:0 "Secure Gib Alzhan"
 orlghelovar_secure_damestear_supply_desc:0 "Magic is a concept which is hard, or impossible even, to fully understand with our current tools. What we do understand however is that gib azhaln plays a vital role in the usage of magic and therefore seems to be the key to understand magic and use it for science using artificery and the likes. Sadly our supply is limited and split between the mages and the artificer which causes issues for us. We need to secure a basic supply from our allies or create a local production for our needs."

 orlghelovar_appease_mages_desc:0 "Our situation grows more dire by the day. Rebels in our country threaten our population, especially the artificers, and blame them for the increase in prices and the tax as a whole. While technically not being a lie they are not the only one to blame. No matter what side is just in this case, this rebellion is a threat to Orlghelovar and therefore has to be quelled! Appeasement can not be done with a knife in our back."

 orlghelovar_ensure_future_stability_desc:0 "The tax had the unforeseen consequence that our realm is now at the brink of collapse. Inhabitants of Orlghelovar do not feel safe anymore as they could be jumped by radicals, be it mages or artificers. This has caused a situation close to an internal civil war. The only way forward is to create a state of stability for now and to do that, we will need close ties to mages and even enlist some for government activities while using some more underhanded tactics for others."

 orlghelovar_revoke_tax_desc:0 "It is time to fix our own mess. While it may have served a cause it is now clear as glass that it was proposed by greedy artificers. If we had only acted earlier we would have gotten away without further damage to Orlghelovar but now it is too late. Even if we revoke it right now, the situation would not change. Instead we have to show our good will to the mages by reinvesting the money gained from the tax and ensure the loyalty of the mages once again. Only then the rebellion can come to an end."

With the discovery of the secret, we can now produce Black Damestear, a material which we have not even begun to understand. Not only do we need dedicated facilities to study this material but also do we need to create areas with black damestear influence to weaken magic and thus allowing more risky projects while also testing the limits of this material. But for this to succeed we need to invest into our black damestear facility to provide with our material needs."
