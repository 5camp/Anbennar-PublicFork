 flavor_orlghelovar.101.t:0 "Glass of Orlghelovar"
 flavor_orlghelovar.101.d:0 "The mood within Orlghelovar is subdued, despite our recent great reawakening - the glassworkers are growing unsatisfied with their craft. While it is undeniable that our glassworkers are the finest, it has always been this way - they have not truly innovated or been challenged for many generations, and their passions are beginning to cool. For the first time since our ancestors began making glass, we can see new scientific possibilities on the horizon.  Our gnomish scientists have already made great leaps in the study of other materials, and with their assistance we may gain a deeper understanding of glass. We must gather our greatest glassworkers and our finest minds to search for new ideas - with one spark we could revitalise the whole industry forever."
 flavor_orlghelovar.101.a:0 "Glass is the way forward!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.102.t:0 "Trader's Advice"
 flavor_orlghelovar.102.d:0 "During a meeting with the most prominent Orlghelovarian glass traders, a radical idea was proposed - what about examining glass from outside the Serpentspine? Many in Orlghelovar decry glassworkers from other nations as backwards and misguided, but for these reasons we have never bothered to ask how they do it. Early reports from a trader loyal to us within a Bulwari glass manufactory suggest their proprietary methods are quite different to ours, and the methods used in Cannor to produce vast quantities of glass are completely opaque to us. From this, it is clear that to truly become the masters of glass, we must incorporate all discoveries in glassmaking! No matter how primitive the glassworkers of the world outside the Serpentspine are, their techniques are still alien to us - researching these may be the spark our glassworkers need to truly perfect their craft."
 flavor_orlghelovar.102.a:0 "Maybe the surface knows."

 flavor_orlghelovar.103.t:0 "The Outside Glass"
 flavor_orlghelovar.103.d:0 "Our information gathering has borne fruit - from the myriad proprietary techniques of Halann's glassworkers we have identified two distinct underlying methods. We have tentatively named these the "Bulwari" and "Cannorian" methods, after the location of the glassworks using them. These methods are the secret to the unique nature of each region's glass, and by analysing these we may glean the results of the many years of experimentation their workers have benefited from. However, such an endeavour will doubtlessly take yet more time - many variations on these methods are used by glassworkers of variable skill, producing glass of greatly varying quality even within each region. These extant techniques must be analysed and the merit of each determined, so that we may combine them all to produce the perfect product. /n/nWe will begin with the Bulwari. Not only are their glassworks closer in proximity to our own, but we have much stronger relations with them than the Cannorians. Furthermore, as the Bulwari were the first to learn of glassmaking from our ancestors their glassmaking should be the most similar to ours - though of course, incomparable in quality."
 flavor_orlghelovar.103.a:0 "Bulwar was choosen by our ancestors for a reason."

 flavor_orlghelovar.104.t:0 "The Glass of Bulwar"
 flavor_orlghelovar.104.d:0 "It seems our prejudice against other glassworkers may have some merit - the glass produced by the Bulwari method cannot hold a candle to ours, even when the method is performed by our own superior craftsmen. Their methods are simply too clumsy and wasteful, borne of an abundance of resources and the near monopoly they enjoyed after our hold was first ravaged. However, within them we can see the designs of our ancestors shining through and though their methods have been diluted by many generations of Bulwari craftsmen, their glassmaking still bears some resemblance to ours. They have clearly not forgotten our assistance in the past, as it is no coincidence their finest glassworks are those closest to Shazstundhir. Though we may have gleaned no new insights into glass, we can now more clearly picture how our ancestors once worked - but to venerate them properly, we must ensure their methods are carried out flawlessly. To this end, we will assist the Bulwari glassworkers once more so that they may create glass our ancestors can be satisfied with. \n\nPerhaps we will find better fortune studying the Cannorian method. We will need to make preparations to send a small contingent of glassworkers to Cannor, as we have had little luck convincing them to come to us."
 flavor_orlghelovar.104.a:0 "Hopefully Cannor will not disappoint"

 flavor_orlghelovar.105.t:0 "The Glass of Cannor"
 flavor_orlghelovar.105.d:0 "Once again, our glassworkers are disappointed! The Cannorian method invariably produces glass of even lower quality than the Bulwari and it is now clear that Halann needed the guiding hand of our ancestors to produce any semi-decent glass. Nothing useful at all can be gleaned from these methods, and many of our citizens are mourning that such a noble art can be performed so barbarically. Curiously, despite the lower quality of the glass produced their glassworkers are much happier and more motivated than ours, in part due to their more relaxed working conditions and standards. The trip was not entirely a waste, though - traders in Cannor are well aware of the lower quality of their glass and have often sought higher quality pieces. Once these traders laid eyes upon the Orlghelovarian glass we had brought with us to compare, our workers were inundated with offers of purchase - with more to come in the future!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.105.a:0 "At least we made money..."

 flavor_orlghelovar.106.t:0 "The End of the Trip"
 flavor_orlghelovar.106.d:0 "Our investigators have come together to summarise the results of our research into Halann's other glassworkers. As expected, we found no improvements or insights that will directly benefit us, as our artisans are simply too practised in their craft. However, we did learn more about what makes their glassworks so prosperous despite their inferior craftsmanship. \n\nThe Bulwari emphasise knowledge sharing and learning between craftsmen, and were particularly receptive both to ours and our ancestors' assistance with glassmaking. This attitude is sorely needed within our nation, as our glassworks have long since broken down into conglomerates - rather than our finest glassworkers working with each other and our less talented, they compete and vie with each other for prestige and wealth. This appears to be an affliction mostly limited to our dwarven artisans as our gnomish scientists are quite fanatical about cataloguing and sharing knowledge, having already produced a compendium of our finest inventions. If this fervour could be channelled into glassmaking, and our own artisans could be swept up into it, perhaps we could foster more co-operation within Orlghelovar."
 flavor_orlghelovar.106.a:0 "Cleared the future!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.107.t:0 "Glasslord Worker Reform"
 flavor_orlghelovar.107.d:0 "Orlghelovar has been reborn anew, and our people are emboldened by our success over the hoardcursed who had slowly come to control most of our nation. Already, there are calls for even more sweeping reforms to workers rights - particularly within the glass industry, as it is both our most important and most venerated profession. With the assistance of Orlghelovar's gnomish scientists and finest advisors, we have distilled all of the research we previously conducted into Halann's glassworks and the lessons learnt from the hoardcurse into the most ambitious set of reforms ever attempted in our nation. \n\nFirstly, the glass industry will no longer be controlled by a select few. It is essential to Orlghelovar and the source of much of our income and employs most of our workforce, and thus will be nationalised and completely owned by our administration. This prevents money being syphoned directly into the pockets of the owners, at the expense of the common worker. All profits from glass will be fed back into the state to fund our projects directly, and workers will receive a proportional and untaxed share of these profits, ensuring they are both incentivised to and can benefit from increased production. With the corrupt owners gone, we can standardise glass production, allowing many of the unreasonable standards and targets for glassworks to be lifted. We must be careful to prevent our workers falling into repetitive dullness, and so we will also allow the glassworkers more personal freedom to choose how and what glass they produce, so long as it meets quality standards. \n\nAdditionally, we will foster a combination of both competition and co-operation in our workers. We will greatly incentivise the sharing of knowledge between glassworks, and sponsor artisans to lead regular workshops for our glassworkers to improve their craft. We will also make leading positions within glassworks only available to those who can win a majority vote of confidence from the workers. This will both improve cohesion in the glassworks and foster healthy competition between individual workers, which will drive them to produce glass of yet greater quality. \n\nAs expected, these proposals are vehemently opposed by those they aim to deprive of power - a small but extremely influential cabal of top glasswork owners and traders who our people have dubbed the "glasslords". Despite the reforms instituted in Orlghelovar to crush monopolies and remove corruption, many of them maintained most of their power and influence by utilising their position as leaders in our foremost industry. As is common within the upper circles of dwarf kind, they are motivated only by greed and power and abhor change in any form. Already we have seen threats both economic and of violence as a response, and as we move forward with these reforms they will only grow bolder. Many within our nation feel that armed rebellion is an inevitability, and that the only question is when they will make their move. Our citizens have already seen the destructive effects of infighting and tire of conflict between our brethren. Thus, any such attempts by the glasslords must be crushed swiftly to maintain the stability of our nation."
 flavor_orlghelovar.107.a:0 "Nothing will stand in the way of progress!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.108.t:0 "Incident at the Glassworks"
 flavor_orlghelovar.108.d:0 "As our reforms near completion, the glasslords dissent and anger have grown to precipitous levels. They have whipped our workers up into a fury with propaganda and empty promises, and have organised strikes and protests at all of our glassworks simultaneously. To attempt to restore peace, we sent officials to each glasswork to reiterate our stance for workers rights, but made the grave error of providing them with a small armed escort. At our glassworks in [Root.Capital] one of their guards overreacted, and swung at a particularly threatening worker - quickly, the protests devolved into an violent brawl, and our official barely escaped with their life. News of this incident spread, amplified by the glasslords, and now the protests have turned into open rebellion at every glassworks! We must act swiftly to protect our industry and put these rebellions down."
 flavor_orlghelovar.108.a:0 "Violence can not stop us."

 flavor_orlghelovar.109.t:0 "The End of the Reform"
 flavor_orlghelovar.109.d:0 "Today, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has gathered a great crowd of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] citizens under the balcony in the forum of [Root.Capital] for a grand announcement. \n\n"Citizens of Orlghelovar" [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] bellows, "The glassworker reforms are finally complete! For the first time, every glassworker in every glassworks has been afforded the privileges and rights they deserve. In doing this, we have surpassed even our ancestors!". Before the crowd can celebrate, he continues "However, this joy is not felt in every corner of the nation. The glasslords have been quiet since their disastrous protests and many have gone into hiding, as you well know. I am told that once news of our accomplishment reached them, they drew all of their remaining wealth and influence to mount a final stand against the forces of progress, going as far as to hire mercenaries to support their rebellion from our neighbouring countries! As I speak, they march on [Root.Capital]". [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] pauses, letting the crowd murmur and shift, before quieting them with a gesture. Another moment, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] voice rings out "It is clear that they will never be satisfied with any world in which they are not in control, and so to safeguard the future of our nation we must purge them once and for all. For the future of Orlghelovar, we must take up arms once more!". At this, [Root.Monarch.GetName] turns and strides from the balcony to the sound of raucous cheering and cries for glasslord blood behind him - the last hurdle of these reforms is upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 flavor_orlghelovar.109.a:0 "The Glasslords were a pain long enough"

 flavor_orlghelovar.110.t:0 "What is Glass?"
 flavor_orlghelovar.110.d:0 "Under the guidance of the Enlightened 10, [Root.Adm_Advisor] was granted a sizable sum and some of our best gnomish scientists to make use of all our recent scientific breakthroughs and discover exactly what glass is. Today, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has presented [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings to the Enlightened 10. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] has discovered, in fact, that there is much more variation in glass than we thought! The glass commonly produced in Halann is made of a material called "silica" but there is huge variation in the structure of finished glass, and these variations are the cause of much of the differences in perceived glass quality. Additionally, there are many impurities in the glass we produce - even in glass we believed to be near perfect. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] has also studied a range of naturally occurring glass and discovered many similarities, and has even claimed that volcanic obsidian shares some properties with our own ordinary glass! With this knowledge, [Root.Adm_Advisor] has made several breakthroughs that will directly affect how we produce glass. \n\nIn their study of silica, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has conclusively shown that different types of sand will produce different glass. Many in our nation believed that any sand could be used to produce identical glass with varying effort, and thus no provisions were made to standardise what sand is used in our glassworks. Upon analysing sand from Bahar and sand from the Dameshead, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] discovered that though they are both comprised mostly of silica they have consistently varying levels of impurities from other minerals that cannot be removed by simple sifting and filtering - these impurities are the cause of much of the variation between our glassworks. With extensive research, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has discovered some inexpensive materials which can be added to the glass during heating to remove the majority of these impurities, as well as some that improve other properties like tensile streng    th or corrosion resistance. We will need to trial these in our glassworks, but with this knowledge we can produce better specialised glass for different uses - no longer will we use the same method to produce glass for a window and glass for a heating flask! \n\n[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] also examined the processes used in our glassworks with [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] new knowledge of the structure of glass. For many centuries glassworkers have known that air has some effect on molten glass and can cause blemishes or impurities in the surface of glass as it cools, but they were powerless to stop this process. Not only has [Root.Adm_Advisor] discovered which gases in the air cause this, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has also proposed a solution to this age-old problem! By cooling glass in an atmosphere of gases that do not react with glass at all, the side of the glass that is exposed to the air will be completely clear and unblemished. We will need efficient methods to produce these gases, and airtight cooling chambers to ensure no contaminating gases can enter, but if this can be done our glassworkers will be more in control of the quality of their glass than ever before. A gnome working under [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] with previous experience in metallurgy also made a valuable observation - currently, molten glass is laid upon beds of iron to cool. This can cause the glass to pool and form unevenly, and the rear side of the glass requires extra polishing. Now that the properties of glass and metals are better understood, he suggested a better method - allowing the molten glass to pour onto a bed of molten metal within the aforementioned protective atmosphere of stable gases. This keeps the glass a uniform thickness, and ensures that both sides are clear and unblemished without the need for polishing. \n\nLastly, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has drawn up a set of quality assurance tests to perform on our glass. These tests are extensive, and go beyond the simple hammer and eye methods of our ancestors. In particular, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has devised an ingenious use of polarised light - light filtered through special glass - which will display coloured streaks in any glass with remaining impurities. These tests will ensure the glass is of sufficient quality, but also allow us to quantify exactly what properties our glass has to better market it to our customers."
 flavor_orlghelovar.110.a:0 "Such splendid information!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.111.t:0 "A Clear Future"
 flavor_orlghelovar.111.d:0 "The atmosphere in Orlghelovar is electric. The culmination of cutting-edge research and radical worker reforms has elevated our glass production far above anything seen anywhere in Halann. Yet our citizens do not rest on their laurels! Our workers are productive and competent, yet also happy and artistically fulfilled. Our glassworks are co-operating, producing a never ending stream of higher and higher quality glass. Our scientists still toil to improve glass production ever further, and with them our position at the scientific forefront of Halann grows too. All marvel at what we have achieved in just a few short centuries since our reawakening, and none will ever match us in glass again!"
