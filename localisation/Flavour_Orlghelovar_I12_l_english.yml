 flavor_orlghelovar.1.t:0 "Open the Outside Markets"
 flavor_orlghelovar.1.d:0 "There is a hushed silence in the state hall as head representative Gloma Firebellow of the glassblowers’ guild presents the engraved wooden box to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The chamber is filled with curious government officials, representatives, and nobles of the hold’s burgeoning merchant clans. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] inspects the oak box, running a finger over its varnished surface and the crest of Orlghelovar engraved into its lid, before flipping the metal clasps and opening the container. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] lifts out a single goblet of perfectly clear crystal glass, mold-blown with an intricate pattern of geometric lines that runs from the rim to the base, each line of identical width and spacing despite the curved surface. The representative Firebellow holds her breath. \n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] lifts the glass up to catch one of the narrow shafts of daylight carried deep into the hold by the state hall’s intricate system of glass-paned surface light-wells. The light splits on the crystalline edge of one point of the goblet’s pattern, and casts a spectrum of colors across the floor. \n\nThus far, Orlghelovar has been little more than a pioneer settlement, a band of former adventurers squatting in the mausoleum of some of the greatest craft-dwarves of Serpentsreach. The workshops and foundries may have been re-opened, but our products have been rudimentary; good enough to serve our domestic markets for bottles and houseware, and for limited trade with traveling merchants passing outside the surface entrance, but not worthy of bearing the maker’s mark of Orlghelovar. \n\nBut this, this is different. This is worthy of the legacy of the Glass Lords. The wooden box is velvet-lined, and filled with twenty of these goblets, all perfectly identical. With glass of this quality, unrivaled in Cannor or Bulwar, Orlghelovar can proudly re-open for trade with the outside world."
 flavor_orlghelovar.1.a:0 "This is but the start of our legacy!"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.2.t:0 "Benefits of an Open Market"
 flavor_orlghelovar.2.d:0 "Our re-entry into international trade and our capital’s position close to the surface has brought many foreign traders from Bulwar and Ourdia to our hold. Our markets and merchant districts now bustle not only with dwarves, but with blonde-haired sun elves, stern-faced Ourdians, and friendly Bulwari. \n\nThe volume and frequency of trade has become so great that a group of human traders have successfully petitioned [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] to settle in our hold permanently, and already a cluster of houses close to our warehouse district have been remodeled to comfortably accommodate their new, taller residents."
 flavor_orlghelovar.2.a:0 "Many more will join us soon"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.3.t:0 "Cobalt Glass"
 flavor_orlghelovar.3.d:0 "There was concern when we initially re-founded Orlghelovar that the veins of cobalt-bearing alloys that our forebears once used to create their distinctive, deep blue glass had been lost or exhausted centuries ago. But this is not so! The Ancestors smiled upon us, as one of our miners not two weeks ago discovered an ancient, abandoned shaft lined with cobaltite. \n\nWith careful experimentation, we have replicated the old method used in Orlghelovar to refine this ore into powdered cobalt dust, and the correct amount to add to the still-molten glass to produce a vivid, deep blue, a perfect match to classical Orlghelovaric wares! This is not just another step toward reclaiming our heritage; it is also a wonderful commercial opportunity! Our customers can drink their dinner wines from crystal glasses the color of the afternoon sky. "

 flavor_orlghelovar.4.t:0 "Old Bulwar Glass"
 flavor_orlghelovar.4.d:0 "From the journal of Grumbhir Heavybellows, senior accountant for the Orlghelovaric-Bulwari Finehammer Caravan Company: \n\n’’Interesting encounter in the market in Aqtbar today. After meeting with F. Zawari at Alchemist’s Guild, I visited an antique dealer under recommendation of Zawari, accompanied by L. Wirebeard. Wirebeard traveled ahead and I arrived 30.min hence, only to discover Wirebeard in argument with the owner of the antique emporium, Ms. T. Surakesi, over the provenance of a glass decanter displayed in the store. Wirebeard is once more causing problems with his refusal to properly learn Bulwari. I do not understand Mrs. Finehammer’s tolerance for him, the man could not sell gold to a goblin. I digress. \n\nI spoke to Surakesi in my own (passable) Bulwari, and achieved a pleasant resolution to the argument! Her store is in possession of many antique Orlghelovaric pieces, phenomenal (as always) craftsmanship. I explained our business coming from re-established Orlghelovar, showed her some samples (including my beloved Glomla’s travel flask) I had in my possession. Surakesi passes her compliments to our glassblowers (reminder; pass this on to Glomla). It appears there is a large market for antique Orlghelovaric glass in Aqtbar at least, and Ms. Zawari claims this is also the case further south! There appears to be a great opportunity to lever this interest into new customers for our own wares.’’"

 flavor_orlghelovar.5.t:0 "Diamond Tools"
 flavor_orlghelovar.5.d:0 "With our control of Arg-Ordstun has come a steady supply of diamonds from the mines surrounding the hold. Some of these are cut and sent straight to market, but other, lower quality diamonds have found a new purpose in our workshops. Dwarves have long been aware of the benefits of diamond-tipped tools for mining, but the superior hardness of diamonds has also shown great utility in precision engraving, cutting, and grinding, allowing us to create finely-detailed work and speed up many of our manufacturing processes. \n\nThe fellows in the glass-engraver’s workshop in Arg-Ôrdstun have sent [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] a beautiful sample showcasing the benefits of their new diamond tools: a pair of cut sculptures of flowering serpentsbloom, both identical, one cut from blue cobalt glass and the other from a large sapphire. The two flowers have a pride of place on [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe]’s desk."

 flavor_orlghelovar.6.t:0 "Orlghelovar Sends an Expedition"
 flavor_orlghelovar.6.d:0 "In the past few years there has been a great deal of activity around the great abandoned dwarven hold that overlooks Salla Ayeth. The sounds of construction can be heard echoing from inside the mountain, and flickering lights have been seen in some of the old windows and entrances to the structure. \n\nYesterday, we discovered the reason for this: a group of dwarven scouts, dressed rather unsuitably for traveling in the forest, stumbled across one of our watchtowers. It took us some time to find a suitable translator who spoke common, but eventually the leader introduced herself as Halir Firmhandle, and explained that they had been sent from Orlghelovar, a newly re-established dwarven hold in the Serpentsreach east of Salla Cenág, that trades in glassware. They seem to be looking for commercial opportunities, and it must be said that the samples they have brought with them are far more refined than the wood-ash glass our own craftspeople make. The question is whether we trust that trade is all these dwarves are looking for in these woods."
 flavor_orlghelovar.6.a:0 "Never let anyone in!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.6.b:0 "This is an intriguing offer"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.7.t:0 "Deepwoods Expedition"
 flavor_orlghelovar.7.d:0 "We have received news from the leader of the scouting party we dispatched into the deepwoods! Commander Halir Firmhandle’s scouts encountered a wood elf tribe not far from the entrance to Verkal Skomdihr, and they were greatly impressed by the quality of our goods. From her account, these elves have faced similar troubles to ourselves, with marauding orcs and goblins forcing them out of their own lands. \n\nIn return for a generous trade agreement, they have given us a priceless gift: complete and detailed maps of the Deepwoods! Given the rather obvious lack of lumber within our own borders, our merchants are already excited by the prospects of trading with these newly-discovered elven states."
 flavor_orlghelovar.7.a:0 "The Wood Elfs will become loyal partners!"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.8.t:0 "Deepwoods Expedition"
 flavor_orlghelovar.8.d:0 "Our scout commander, Halir Firmhandle, returned from her mission into the deepwoods yesterday looking rather worse for wear. As she explained between pulling arrow after bone-tipped arrow out of her leather armor, her scouting party had encountered an elven settlement. While they had approached the elves with offers of trade, the elves had rejected them in no uncertain terms, calling them ‘untrustworthy soil-eaters’ and shooting at them until they were forced to retreat. \n\nThe expedition was not all in vain, though, as Halir’s party did manage to scout out the forest outside Verkal Skomdihr during their trip. At least now we will know who our neighbors are."
 flavor_orlghelovar.8.a:0 "At least now we know"
 
 flavor_orlghelovar.9.t:0 "An Alliance for the Future"
 flavor_orlghelovar.9.d:0 "Following our initial missive, there have been days of negotiations between ourselves and Ovdal Tungir, intensive back-and-forth debates over individual trade clauses and rights and responsibilities toward travelers and merchants. Finally, on the evening of the third day, diplomats from both parties emerged from the state hall of Ovdal Tungir and informed the gathered crowd of local residents and visiting dignitaries that an agreement had been reached. \n\nWe will generously transfer ownership of the surface territory we have taken from the Ourdians and Goblins in Bahar. In return, Ovdal Tungir has given us something equally valuable: access to ocean trade routes in Bulwar and Cannor through their own vessels, a guaranteed military alliance, and a declaration of friendship between our two states. It is a glorious day for Orlghelovar! With this, we take another step toward the future, and we do it arm-in-arm with our copper siblings."
 flavor_orlghelovar.9.a:0 "May the future be prosperous"

 flavor_orlghelovar.10.t:0 "New Policy"
 flavor_orlghelovar.10.d:0 "For many years we have deepened our political and economic ties with our fellow hold of Ovdal Tungir, and it has become increasingly clear that for the most efficient management of our country, it would be best to take more direct control over our client state’s territories. While some in Ovdal Tungir have voiced complaints, they have been allayed with the reassurances that their essential role in shipbuilding and oceanic trade will continue to guarantee their prosperity and prominence. \n\nThese are not just idle promises: now that we are directly administering our Bahari territories, we can focus our commercial efforts toward dominating trade in Bulwar and beyond. The goods and merchants of a thousand surface countries will flow through Orlghelovar, and it will arrive through Ovdal Tungir, our grandest port!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.10.a:0 "It was long overdue"

 flavor_orlghelovar.11.t:0 "Rumors of a Vulcano"
 flavor_orlghelovar.11.d:0 "This week the straggling remnants of a failed dwarven adventuring party arrived at our borders. While most of their number were surface dwarves, among them was a curious traveler: a Garnet Dwarf scholar named Shaz Helmtapper, a former resident of a remnant hold in the Serpentsreach called Ovdal Lodhum. He explained that he was a scholar of dwarven cultures, and had joined the adventuring party upon learning they were from other dwarven communities from the surface. \n\nUpon hearing of our own attempts to recover the glassblowing heritage of our hold, he mentioned something fascinating. Apparently, along with its famed magma-fuelled armories, the lost hold of Gor Bûrad in the far eastern edge of the Serpentreach was also famous for a different kind of craft: glassworking, with volcanic obsidian! \n\nIf this is true, securing control of this lost hold would not only secure new space for settlements, but also might open up untold scientific and commercial opportunities. Crossing the Serpentreach would, however, be a substantial undertaking. We must head east, to learn more from these remaining Garnet Dwarves, and perhaps even take the volcano for ourselves."
 flavor_orlghelovar.11.a:0 "Is there really glass on the other side?"

 flavor_orlghelovar.12.t:0 "At the Doorsteps of Gor Bûrad"
 flavor_orlghelovar.12.d:0 "As the dwarven road approaches the old hold, the straight and perfectly cut tunnel increasingly opens up as it passes through the ruins of old magma tubes deep in the volcanic heart of the east Serpentreach. Finally, the road arrives at the hold itself, and the scouting party slows. Our scout commander, Halir Firmhandle, grips the handle of her rifle and stares awestruck at her surroundings. The itinerant Garnet Dwarf scholar, Shaz Helmtapper, insisted on accompanying the expedition, and is struck equally silent, his notebook slack in his hands. \n\n‘By the Ancestors, there really is a volcano down here,’ Halir mutters, nudging Shaz with her elbow. The endpoint of the dwarven road is a vaulted bridge of basalt over a vast magma flow, easily a mile wide, cutting through an enormous underground gorge. The molten rock casts the surroundings in an eerie red glow, the light catching the fractured surface of veins of obsidian exposed in sections of the cliff. \n\nBeyond the bridge lies our final destination. The tell-tale fortifications, external supports and grand, reinforced door belie an underground dwarven hold, Gor Bûrad! "
 flavor_orlghelovar.12.a:0 "The rumors were true!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.13.t:0 "Excavation"
 flavor_orlghelovar.13.d:0 "Now that we have gained control of Gor Bûrad and the surrounding caverns, we can turn our attention to the mineral wealth of the area. While our geologists are not sure why minerals occur more frequently around volcanoes – perhaps due to the movement and heat of the rock, or being carried in the currents of magma – Dwarven scholarship is clear that volcanoes are rich areas for mining. The system of caverns in the Zarn region has been identified by our prospectors and geologists as the most promising candidate in the area around Gor Bûrad, and initial explorations have already shown some shallow deposits of gems and minerals. Investing in more intensive mineral exploration in the area will take time and money, but the dividends could be enormous. It is time to strike the earth!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.13.a:0 "Time to mine!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.14.t:0 "Striking Sapphire"
 flavor_orlghelovar.14.d:0 "Deep in the caverns of our mineral exploration project in Zarn, a miner swings his pickaxe into the rock, only to find it shuddering to a halt. Curious, he fiddles in his belt for a smaller pick and chips away at the rock around the spot he struck, brushing dirt away with his free hand, until the light of his helmet-lamp catches on some flat, reflective surface with a tell-tale blue gleam. \n\nBy the time the foreman arrives, hurried down the tunnel with two miners at his heels, a small crowd has gathered around the tunnel section, and several lamps have been set down to light the area. What he can see is the edge of an enormous sapphire deposit, the section found in the tunnel easily as tall as a dwarf, and the beginnings of a tunnel alongside it show that it stretches much further and deeper into the earth. Even this single exposed section of sapphires would be enormously valuable, and depending on how far deep it runs, the miners may have stumbled upon a truly massive volume of gems. \n\nOur merchants are already tallying the estimated revenues from such a deposit, and our scientists are eager to explore the refractive properties of such high-quality sapphire."

 flavor_orlghelovar.101.t:0 "Glass of Orlghelovar"
 flavor_orlghelovar.101.d:0 "The mood within Orlghelovar is subdued, despite our recent great reawakening - the glassworkers are growing unsatisfied with their craft. While it is undeniable that our glassworkers are the finest, it has always been this way - they have not truly innovated or been challenged for many generations, and their passions are beginning to cool. For the first time since our ancestors began making glass, we can see new scientific possibilities on the horizon.  Our gnomish scientists have already made great leaps in the study of other materials, and with their assistance we may gain a deeper understanding of glass. We must gather our greatest glassworkers and our finest minds to search for new ideas - with one spark we could revitalise the whole industry forever."
 flavor_orlghelovar.101.a:0 "Glass is the way forward!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.102.t:0 "Trader's Advice"
 flavor_orlghelovar.102.d:0 "During a meeting with the most prominent Orlghelovarian glass traders, a radical idea was proposed - what about examining glass from outside the Serpentspine? Many in Orlghelovar decry glassworkers from other nations as backwards and misguided, but for these reasons we have never bothered to ask how they do it. Early reports from a trader loyal to us within a Bulwari glass manufactory suggest their proprietary methods are quite different to ours, and the methods used in Cannor to produce vast quantities of glass are completely opaque to us. From this, it is clear that to truly become the masters of glass, we must incorporate all discoveries in glassmaking! No matter how primitive the glassworkers of the world outside the Serpentspine are, their techniques are still alien to us - researching these may be the spark our glassworkers need to truly perfect their craft."
 flavor_orlghelovar.102.a:0 "Maybe the surface knows."

 flavor_orlghelovar.103.t:0 "The Outside Glass"
 flavor_orlghelovar.103.d:0 "Our information gathering has borne fruit - from the myriad proprietary techniques of Halann's glassworkers we have identified two distinct underlying methods. We have tentatively named these the "Bulwari" and "Cannorian" methods, after the location of the glassworks using them. These methods are the secret to the unique nature of each region's glass, and by analysing these we may glean the results of the many years of experimentation their workers have benefited from. However, such an endeavour will doubtlessly take yet more time - many variations on these methods are used by glassworkers of variable skill, producing glass of greatly varying quality even within each region. These extant techniques must be analysed and the merit of each determined, so that we may combine them all to produce the perfect product. \n\nWe will begin with the Bulwari. Not only are their glassworks closer in proximity to our own, but we have much stronger relations with them than the Cannorians. Furthermore, as the Bulwari were the first to learn of glassmaking from our ancestors their glassmaking should be the most similar to ours - though of course, incomparable in quality."
 flavor_orlghelovar.103.a:0 "Bulwar was choosen by our ancestors for a reason."

 flavor_orlghelovar.104.t:0 "The Glass of Bulwar"
 flavor_orlghelovar.104.d:0 "It seems our prejudice against other glassworkers may have some merit - the glass produced by the Bulwari method cannot hold a candle to ours, even when the method is performed by our own superior craftsmen. Their methods are simply too clumsy and wasteful, borne of an abundance of resources and the near monopoly they enjoyed after our hold was first ravaged. However, within them we can see the designs of our ancestors shining through and though their methods have been diluted by many generations of Bulwari craftsmen, their glassmaking still bears some resemblance to ours. They have clearly not forgotten our assistance in the past, as it is no coincidence their finest glassworks are those closest to Shazstundhir. Though we may have gleaned no new insights into glass, we can now more clearly picture how our ancestors once worked - but to venerate them properly, we must ensure their methods are carried out flawlessly. To this end, we will assist the Bulwari glassworkers once more so that they may create glass our ancestors can be satisfied with. \n\nPerhaps we will find better fortune studying the Cannorian method. We will need to make preparations to send a small contingent of glassworkers to Cannor, as we have had little luck convincing them to come to us."
 flavor_orlghelovar.104.a:0 "Hopefully Cannor will not disappoint"

 flavor_orlghelovar.105.t:0 "The Glass of Cannor"
 flavor_orlghelovar.105.d:0 "Once again, our glassworkers are disappointed! The Cannorian method invariably produces glass of even lower quality than the Bulwari and it is now clear that Halann needed the guiding hand of our ancestors to produce any semi-decent glass. Nothing useful at all can be gleaned from these methods, and many of our citizens are mourning that such a noble art can be performed so barbarically. Curiously, despite the lower quality of the glass produced their glassworkers are much happier and more motivated than ours, in part due to their more relaxed working conditions and standards. The trip was not entirely a waste, though - traders in Cannor are well aware of the lower quality of their glass and have often sought higher quality pieces. Once these traders laid eyes upon the Orlghelovarian glass we had brought with us to compare, our workers were inundated with offers of purchase - with more to come in the future!"
 flavor_orlghelovar.105.a:0 "At least we made money..."

 flavor_orlghelovar.106.t:0 "The End of the Trip"
 flavor_orlghelovar.106.d:0 "Our investigators have come together to summarise the results of our research into Halann's other glassworkers. As expected, we found no improvements or insights that will directly benefit us, as our artisans are simply too practised in their craft. However, we did learn more about what makes their glassworks so prosperous despite their inferior craftsmanship. \n\nThe Bulwari emphasise knowledge sharing and learning between craftsmen, and were particularly receptive both to ours and our ancestors' assistance with glassmaking. This attitude is sorely needed within our nation, as our glassworks have long since broken down into conglomerates - rather than our finest glassworkers working with each other and our less talented, they compete and vie with each other for prestige and wealth. This appears to be an affliction mostly limited to our dwarven artisans as our gnomish scientists are quite fanatical about cataloguing and sharing knowledge, having already produced a compendium of our finest inventions. If this fervour could be channelled into glassmaking, and our own artisans could be swept up into it, perhaps we could foster more co-operation within Orlghelovar."
 flavor_orlghelovar.106.a:0 "Cleared the future!"

 flavor_orlghelovar.107.t:0 "Glasslord Worker Reform"
 flavor_orlghelovar.107.d:0 "Orlghelovar has been reborn anew, and our people are emboldened by our success over the hoardcursed who had slowly come to control most of our nation. Already, there are calls for even more sweeping reforms to workers rights - particularly within the glass industry, as it is both our most important and most venerated profession. With the assistance of Orlghelovar's gnomish scientists and finest advisors, we have distilled all of the research we previously conducted into Halann's glassworks and the lessons learnt from the hoardcurse into the most ambitious set of reforms ever attempted in our nation. \n\nFirstly, the glass industry will no longer be controlled by a select few. As a cornerstone of our economy, society, and culture, it is essential to Orlghelovar and thus will be nationalised and completely owned by our administration. No longer will profits be syphoned into the pockets of the owners at the expense of the common worker. All profits from glass will be fed back into the state to fund our projects directly, and workers will receive a proportional and untaxed share of these profits, ensuring they are both incentivised to and can benefit from increased production. With the corrupt owners gone, we can standardise glass production, allowing many of the unreasonable standards and targets for glassworks to be lifted. We must be careful to prevent our workers falling into repetitive dullness, and so we will also allow the glassworkers more personal freedom to choose how and what glass they produce, so long as it meets our quality standards. \n\nWe will also foster a combination of both competition and co-operation in our workers. We will greatly incentivise the sharing of knowledge between glassworks, and sponsor artisans to lead regular workshops for our glassworkers to improve their craft. We will make leading positions within glassworks only available to those who can win a majority vote of confidence from the workers. This will both improve cohesion in the glassworks and foster healthy competition between individual workers, which will drive them to produce glass of yet greater quality. \n\nAs expected, these proposals are vehemently opposed by those they aim to deprive of power - a small but extremely influential cabal of top glasswork owners and traders who our people have dubbed the "glasslords". Despite the reforms instituted in Orlghelovar to crush monopolies and remove corruption, many of them maintained most of their power and influence by utilising their position as leaders in our foremost industry. As is common within the upper circles of dwarf kind, they are motivated only by greed and abhor change in any form. Already we have seen threats both economic and of violence as a response, and as we move forward with these reforms they will only grow bolder. Many within our nation feel that armed rebellion is an inevitability, and that the only question is when they will make their move. Our citizens have already seen the destructive effects of infighting and tire of conflict between our brethren. Thus, we must be prepared to swiftly crush any such attempts by the glasslords maintain the stability of our nation."

 flavor_orlghelovar.108.t:0 "Incident at the Glassworks"
 flavor_orlghelovar.108.d:0 "As our reforms near completion, the glasslords dissent and anger have grown to precipitous levels. They have whipped our workers up into a fury with propaganda and empty promises, and have organised strikes and protests at all of our glassworks simultaneously. To attempt to restore peace, we sent officials to each glasswork to reiterate our stance for workers rights, but made the grave error of providing them with a small armed escort. At our glassworks in [Root.Capital.GetName] one of their guards overreacted, and swung at a particularly threatening worker - quickly, the protests devolved into a violent brawl, and our official barely escaped with their life. News of this incident spread, amplified by the glasslords, and now the protests have turned into open rebellion at every glassworks! We must act swiftly to protect our industry and put these rebellions down."

For the first time, every glassworker in every glassworks has been afforded the privileges and rights they deserve. In doing this, we have surpassed even our ancestors!". Before the crowd can celebrate, he continues "However, this joy is not felt in every corner of the nation. The glasslords have been quiet since their disastrous protests and many have gone into hiding, as you well know. I am told that once news of our accomplishment reached them, they drew all of their remaining wealth and influence to mount a final stand against the forces of progress, going as far as to hire mercenaries to support their rebellion from our neighbouring countries! As I speak, they march on [Root.Capital.GetName]". [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] pauses, letting the crowd murmur and shift, before quieting them with a gesture. Another moment, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] voice rings out "It is clear that they will never be satisfied with any world in which they are not in control, and so to safeguard the future of our nation we must purge them once and for all. For the future of Orlghelovar, we must take up arms once more!". At this, [Root.Monarch.GetName] turns and strides from the balcony to the sound of raucous cheering and cries for glasslord blood behind him - the last hurdle of these reforms is upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 flavor_orlghelovar.109.a:0 "The Glasslords were a pain long enough"

 flavor_orlghelovar.110.t:0 "What is Glass?"
 flavor_orlghelovar.110.d:0 "Under the guidance of the Enlightened 10, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] was granted a sizable sum and some of our best gnomish scientists to make use of all our recent scientific breakthroughs and discover exactly what glass is. Today, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has presented [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings to the council. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] has discovered that there is much more variation in glass than we thought! Although most glass is made of the same primary material, silica, there is great variation in the structure of even visually similar glass. There are also many impurities in the glass we produce, even in pieces we thought to be near perfect. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] also studied a range of naturally occurring glass and discovered other similarities, claiming that even volcanic obsidian shares some properties with ordinary glass! With this research, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has made several breakthroughs that will directly affect how we produce glass. \n\nIn [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] study of silica, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] determined that different types of sand will produce different glass. Many artisans believed that any sand could be used to produce identical glass with varying effort, and thus no provisions were made to standardise what sand is used in our glassworks. Upon analysing sand from Bahar and from the Dameshead, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] discovered that though they are both comprised mostly of silica they each have different levels of impurities that cannot be removed by simple sifting and filtering - these are the cause of much of the variation between regional glass. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] also identified some inexpensive materials which can be added while heating to remove many of these impurities, as well as some that improve other properties like tensile strength or corrosion resistance. With this revelation we can produce better specialised glass for different uses, no longer will we use the same method to produce glass for a window and glass for a heating flask! \n\n[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] also examined the processes used in our glassworks with [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] new knowledge of the structure of glass. Ordinarily, glassworkers lay molten glass to cool on great sheets of solid iron. Glass cooled this way is often uneven and always blemishes on the side touching the iron and so must be polished after the cooling is complete, wasting both time and material. On the suggestion of a gnomish scientist with experience in metallurgy, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] devised a new method where molten glass "floats" upon a bed of molten metal to cool. If the metal chosen is one that will not mix with molten glass, such as tin, then the glass formed will be perfectly smooth and unblemished without any polishing. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] has also drawn up a set of quality assurance tests to perform on our glass. These tests are extensive, going beyond the simple hammer and eye methods of our ancestors. In particular, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has devised an ingenious use of polarised light, which will display coloured streaks in any glass with remaining impurities. These tests will ensure our glass is of sufficient quality, but also allow us to quantify exactly what properties our glass has to better market it to our customers."

What fire also produces, however, is heat, smoke, ash, and grime. What we need is a more pure light. In order to achieve this, our artificers are not heating up flammable material, but very small amounts of a metal alloy. Being heated to just under its melting point by the damestear, the alloy produces a very large amount of light. Besides allowing the damestear to last much longer, this also produces no smoke or grime, meaning that the devices do not need to be cleaned to retain their shine. The only problem now is that the individual devices are the size of a dwarf, and therefore very expensive."

 flavor_orlghelovar.114.d:0 "Magic is a difficult topic to study. While artificery is able to manifest quite a bit, it is often more through reproduction and iteration of spells than by invention. In other words: while we often know *how* magic works, we rarely know *why* it works. It limits its use on a very fundamental level. And at the core of it, of course, is gib azhaln, what the Cannorians know as damestear. It empowers our runes, and in turn, our artefacts. Beyond this, it is the primary driving force behind the power of the mages, who by and large are unaccountable and virtually impossible to regulate. For this reason, we intend to fund much more research into gib azhaln itself."

 flavor_orlghelovar.115.d:0 "Following reports that the research into gib azhaln is straining due to a lack of supply, our researchers have petitioned the High Council to step in. If they have to keep working at this pace, they claim, research is going to take several lifetimes. Attempts to import gib azhaln from abroad have resulted in very little, and existing deposits cannot be effectively mined faster without serious safety risks. In order to secure the large amounts of gib azhaln we need, they request that we limit its use for other projects: by levying a harsh tax on the use of gib azhaln for purposes not related to research, they claim, we can ensure the supply remains large enough for the quantities needed for research."

 flavor_orlghelovar.116.t:0 "A Minor Issue"
 flavor_orlghelovar.116.d:0 "There is a degree of discontent over the gib azhaln tax, as those mages and artificers who cannot afford the higher prices complain they cannot do their work. Arguments that their work may be much improved if the research is allowed to continue do little to sway them. Ultimately, however, they are few in number and influence and are as such easy to ignore."

Our advisors, however, disagree vehemently about what exactly needs to change. Some demand retribution: the mages were fundamentally disloyal to Orlghelovar, and should not expect to be welcome still. They should be exiled for what they have done. Others, however, argue quite the opposite. The protests and the rebellion have shown just how reliant we actually are on the mages. We should elevate their position above the scientists, and ensure that we are not put into this position again. A small number of advisors, however, see a third path. They believe the root of the problem lies in the division between the scientists and the mages, and want to restructure the council on a fundamental level. Research and practice of magic, they argue, must intertwine, lest we either lose sight of progress or lose our grounding in reality. This final proposal is broadly viewed as utopian and unachievable, especially now that there is already bad blood between these groups."

It's obvious that the glass should be paired with a metal for structural, ergonomic, and economic reasons, but how? Two craftsmen have come to the council with their ideas: \n\nThe first, a glass expert by the name of Brokkr, who helped develop Sapphire Glass, proposes armor made of sheets of Glass, which are held to each other by a framing of mild steel. This reliance on glass means they will need thick sheets, which could have drawbacks. However, the steel is cheap, and the glassworkers are confident their new material can outclass metal in almost every aspect. Besides, we the dwarves that brought us our new glass a chance to continue working for the state. \n\nThe second idea comes from a young apprentice by the name of Grunhilt. She would like to fabricate a suit of armor out of thin sheets of mithril, which then have plates of Sapphire glass adhered to them as an extra shell. She claims this is the best way to create light, shatter resistant armor. She may be right, but she is also inexperienced, much of her required technology doesn't yet exist, and we owe her nothing."

They'd like an open apology by the state, admitting that we caused undue damage to her reputation by refusing to work with her, and that our lack of meritocratic advancement has set back our innovations.

Luckily one of the few inventions actually brought to the council was a prototype crowd suppression weapon, and with the quick thinking of the inventor all the perpetrators were captured with minimal casualties.

Leading scientists amongst Orghelovar have taken interest in using their excess supply of damestear in a new gigantic undertaking: Controlling and focusing magic to their whim, via the form of a ray of magical energy. While all of this theoretically would require a mage, what if they removed the mage completely? Put the power into the hands of the normal one might say. With the new developments with glass, damestear, and science as a whole, it looks to be a mountain that Orlghelovar may be able to take on.

Through various means, our team of dedicated scientists had come up with similar theories on how to conserve energy. A casing made of a specific material which had similar properties to magically empowered items. Items that may come to mind are the scepters of mages, which can be made of various materials, but usually are glass. One of our scientists managed to make a case of our special Sapphire Glass, a case of Regular Glass, and a case of Mithril. Left for three days in a chamber, the cases were taken out and a mage was brought in to confirm the results. \n\nHe said in a booming voice “This is hilarious! With all these rare materials you all thought you’d surely be able to contain magical energy. It has seeped out of all of these boxes.” All of the scientists were disappointed, and prepared to have to give a negative report to their upper command, when, shockingly, the mage handed a book of magic to one of the Scientists, named Muradir Megyir.

Inside the sphere, the walls would be covered with a reflective steel, and a thick piece of glass placed in front of the magnifying glass. It would be held up by two stilts, and a baseplate to keep the main device planted on the ground while firing. The scientists immediately began to work on this new device, hoping that this last ditch effort by Muradir would surely prove correct. The device was finished, and a piece of damestear was slotted in, and then the magnifying glass sealed on. \n\nAfter three more weeks of waiting, the Mage had returned to collect his book, and to test the machine once more. Muradir handed the book to the Mage, and showed him the way to the mechanism. The Mage looked at it with a sort of awe, one that gave everyone in the room a little bit of hope. \nThe Mage smiled, and announced that the mechanism would work. The scientists erupted in happiness, and began to plan out the next steps for the device."

 flavor_orlghelovar.152.d:0 "With the mechanism now certified complete and ready to go, the team of scientists now had to construct a testing site for the device. This “Ground Zero” would have to be in a place where there could be absolutely no extra variables applied to the experiment. If anything were to so slightly alter the test, it could have dire consequences. Thus, Muradir petitioned for a room to be made of black damestear. While this room would be ideal to test the device in, it would exhaust most of Orlghelovar’s black damestear reserves. This would mean that other experiments would have to be delayed or halted completely. When this was brought to the court of some of Orlghelovar’s greatest minds, they debated for hours on whether they should give the go ahead. \nEventually, it was decided that it would be best for the laser to take priority for now, and that the black damestear room, codename “Black Box,” would be built for the test. While all other experiments may halt, it will be worth the wait."

 flavor_orlghelovar.153.d:0 "The Black Box is complete. The device had been transported hours ago, with additional changes made so that one would be able to activate the laser via a lever that would hyper-energize anything inside of the cylinder, which would in turn pass through the thick glass and be focused into a small beam by the magnifier at the end of the cylinder. At the other side of the room, a piece of steel to test the effects of the beam. \nScientists gather in anticipation for the results of the test. Muradir especially looked on with joy with how many have come to the realization of his greatest work. A volunteer entered the chamber, and activated the mechanism. As the device slowly powered up, one could hear noises from the outside of the room as if an explosion was about to go off. Everyone was worried, afraid to what may be going on inside. \nThen, the volunteer opened the door for everyone to enter the room. They entered to the sight of the first L.A.D in existence. A small, yet steady flow of energy was passing through the glass "

 #Advanced Laser            written by Spyhaus
 flavor_orlghelovar.200.t:0 "Advancement of L.A.D.s"
 flavor_orlghelovar.200.d:0 "After the success of our LAD, we have begun work on the implementation of our new tool into our society. This process begins with the shrinking down of the LAD. Already gargantuan in size, one had to climb and sit upon a specialized seat to be able to use and control the device properly. This would be fine if it was to emit a mass amount of energy, but at its current state, it would be a waste of metal and damestear. Thankfully, our team of highly trained scientists has managed to size down the LAD to where it is able to be transported with ease, and to where its production viability becomes less of an issue. It still has a measly output, but we also have a team working on how to improve the amount of energy our laser is able to emit while still keeping the photons stable and coherent.\n\nThe speed at which we are all moving towards advancements with our laser is astounding."

 flavor_orlghelovar.201.t:0 "Laser Cutter"
 flavor_orlghelovar.201.d:0 "Searching for a use for the LAD in our society has been frustrating to say the least. Many businesses and corporations disregarded the laser for being of no use to them with its high cost and maintenance.\n\nRecently though, a use of our LAD has been found in the mining sector of our nation! Deepening the hold had now become tedious and difficult. They were in need of assistance, and we were there to help. We proceeded to send our LAD’s to where the digging had been taking place, and worked with the local miners in clearing out the area for testing.\n\nThe lasers were charged up, and they instantly went to work! The dirt and rocks were seared and then melted. With pace, the lasers made good progress with mining and then some. At the end of the day, the miners offered to cooperate with the scientists behind the lasers and purchased some of our lasers to assist them.\n\nIn the end, while we found a small victory, we assume that we probably couldn’t emulate the same for regular mining. Hold Deepening is a very different style of work from other forms, with high forms of pay in comparison. For now though, we take this as a sign of progress, and continue to find ways in how to improve our LAD, and how to continue integrating laser technology into the aspects of the nation of Orlghelovar."

 flavor_orlghelovar.202.t:0 "Laser Cannon"
 flavor_orlghelovar.202.d:0 "It is the beginning of the day of testing, and the LAD “cannon” has been placed along the beach. We have prepared the testing site in the lands outside to avoid damaging our tunnels and holds, in case something were to go awry. \n\nThe first prototype of what is to come, it is larger than your usual cannon, comparable to the original LAD, but with an obvious increase in complexity. A dark blue in color, the cannon is placed onto the ground, and drilled in place. The back of the cannon was clear. In the inside one could see a large piece of Damestear. Small pieces of glass are placed in the front and back of the device’s barrels. In the inside, a heavy set of special glass that functions as a gain medium for our cannon. All measures were taken to make sure the cannon would function properly to avoid a crisis. \n\nThe beach is still, the waves splash on shore and sink back into the waves. On the other side of the beach, a small mountainside awaited, around a little less than a kilometer away. There were no clouds present.\nSuddenly, a bright blue laser bursted out from the cannon, and beams forward for a split second before immediately dissipating into nothingness. The effects though, they lingered. The waves had receded, the sand had fine pieces of glass in them, and over in the distance, pieces of the mountain looked like they were melting off, causing parts of the mountain to collapse, creating a massive cloud of dust and matter. Most notably of all though; the heat. All around us the heat had risen in the areas that the beam had affected. Scorched and melted lands lay ahead of us. The very moisture on our skin had dissipated into nothingness. \n\nNeedless to say, this was over what we had expected. We have created something we aren’t sure should even exist. Do our ancestors frown upon us? This will be a weight on us since we are the makers of such a thing. At the “celebration party” a lead scientist on the development of the cannon, declared that it would now be Orlghelovars job and utmost priority to keep this technology from the hands of those willing to use it for evil. The room nodded silently in agreement."

 orlghelovar_recruit_great_minds_desc:0 "With our recent refoundation of Orlghelovar we faced a certain issue. Dwarfs from all over Halann do not want to join us and we are lacking in forward thinking people. Extensive planning has to be done for us to become a major country in the world and for that we need everyone we can get. Let us pay handsomely for experts to join us."

 orlghelovar_expand_production_title:0 "Expand Production"
 orlghelovar_expand_production_desc:0 "It was decided that we should focus on the same thing as the orlghelovaric dwarfs of old. Trade was and always will be important for us and to have a successful trading empire we need to increase our production in different parts of our country in order to open our markets and to not collapse from it."

 orlghelovar_not_so_britle_anymore_title:0 "Not so brittle anymore"
 orlghelovar_not_so_britle_anymore_desc:0 "Our new home is as brittle as glass. Being a surface hold has its advantages, like easy acces to lucrative trading routes. But the main disadvantage is the constant fear of being invaded from the outside. We need to fortify Orlghelovar to keep it safe forever more."

 orlghelovar_restore_the_glassworks_title:0 "Restore the Glassworks"
 orlghelovar_restore_the_glassworks_desc:0 "With our production increasing in our country and Orlghelovar secured, we can finally start to focus on what we can do best, glass. Orlghelovar was known as a hold of great wealth through trading in glass. Our hold has to be expanded and reclaimed from what it once was for us to start production at a fraction of what our ancestors were once capable of."

 orlghelovar_cobalt_not_only_in_name_title:0 "Cobalt not only in Name"
 orlghelovar_cobalt_not_only_in_name_desc:0 "When reclaiming Orlghelovar we located a massive mining structure right next to the hold. When we dug further it became apparent it was the ancient cobalt mine of Orlghelovar which gave the dwarfs from the hold their name. Our advisors incentivised us to restart the mining in that mine."

 orlghelovar_combinations_of_glass_title:0 "Combinations of Glass"
 orlghelovar_combinations_of_glass_desc:0 "With the cobalt mine reclaimed and restarted we should try to recreate the trademark of our ancestors, a blue coloured glass with cobalt pigments. We know for certainty it can be done but we can not quite manage to reproduce it. We will need new tools made of sturdy diamonds to create the necessary tools."

 orlghelovar_crystal_experts_title:0 "Crystal Experts"
 orlghelovar_crystal_experts_desc:0 "Old maps indicate that Arg-Ôrdstun is close by. It is a hold known for its defiance against Aul-Dwarov and its gigantic mines. Reclaiming it in our name would be a prestigious act and would also give us access to new possibilities within the Serpentreach."

 orlghelovar_marble_experts_title:0 "Marble Experts"
 orlghelovar_marble_experts_desc:0 "In the south of Orlghelovar lies another abandoned Hold named Shazstundihr. In the days of old it was known for its impressive buildings made out of marble. Even though the building technique is most likely gone forever we can use it as a strategic outpost in our growing realm and therefore should reclaim it as well."

 orlghelovar_stabilze_our_reign_desc:0 "As it turned out Arg-Ôrdstun never fell in the greentide and instead was a remnant hold. They never lost their defiant spirit but instead it only grew stronger. We currently face the same problem Aul-Dwarov most likely faced with them but we can use the situation to our advantage. If we show them our generous support in rebuilding their home they will surely become more attuned with our goals and accept our reign over them."

 orlghelovar_new_trading_partners_title:0 "New Trading Partners"
 orlghelovar_new_trading_partners_desc:0 "With Shazstundhir and Arg-Ôrdstun reclaimed we can start peeking outwards to our allies of old. The countries in Bulwar were historic trading partners with Orlghelovar as can still be seen in their ancient structures where they used our iconic cobalt glass. But no country of the old days still exists, only new fractured states in permanent infighting between humans and elves. We should not interfere in the politics of the region but instead become friends with both sides to always come out on top."

 orlghelovar_first_steps_title:0 "First Steps"
 orlghelovar_first_steps_desc:0 "With the reclamation of Shazstundhir finalized we can start using its strategic position. It is the western gateway from the Serpentspine into Bulwar and situated close to Bahari ports and trade routes. We should start building up our own trade posts close to those routes to also start profiting from our location and our goods."

 orlghelovar_impress_bulwar_thinkers_title:0 "Impress Bulwar"
 orlghelovar_impress_bulwar_thinkers_desc:0 "Although constantly in war and in religious instability, Bulwar offers opportunities. Wars create brilliant personalities and thinkers. Ancient elves with their immense knowledge gathered through their long lives, even for dwarven standards.

 orlghelovar_diamonds_and_glass_desc:0 "Glass is a hard material to work with. We have perfected it either way, but that does not mean we stop searching for new methods and tools. A diamond is the hardest thing we know, maybe the dwarfs in Arg-Ordstun can develop something with it. A material can only be cut with something harder, therefore diamonds might be the best cutting tool."

 orlghelovar_increase_demand_for_diamonds_title:0 "Diamond Demand"
 orlghelovar_increase_demand_for_diamonds_desc:0 "Glass is our main trade, but we do not neglect our other goods. Our most recently developed tool, diamond cutting tools, are low in supply. Demands can not be satisfied by the raw diamond supply of the mines near Arg-Orgstun. It is therefore our duty as a cobalt dwarf to mine those diamonds for our glassworkers!"

 orlghelovar_diamond_quarry_title:0 "The Diamond Quarry"
 orlghelovar_diamond_quarry_desc:0 "The Diamond Quarry, as the name suggests, is famous for its sheer amounts of diamonds. It’s almost like a never ending supply of diamonds, just waiting for us to mine them and use them for our needs. Since our demand for diamonds went up quite significantly, we should invest in the local mining structures and expand it to prevent shortages."

 orlghelovar_integrate_baharkandis_ways_title:0 "Integrate Baharkandi"
 orlghelovar_integrate_baharkandis_ways_desc:0 "Right outside of Shazstundihr’s borders lies the now partially devastated realm of Baharkand. Though not a dwarf state or integrated into Aul-Dwarov at any point in history, its significance to us now is remarkable. In current times, the coast of said realm was known as ‘Gulf of Glass’, not only for its beauty but also for its big glass production. The methods they use originate back from our ancestors and they made it their own tradition. While this makes us happy to see the work of our ancestors pay off, we have to consider them as serious rivals for common glass and therefore fully integrate their production into our hands if we want to dominate the glass market in Bulwar."

 orlghelovar_make_partners_depended_title:0 "Make Partners Dependet"
 orlghelovar_make_partners_depended_desc:0 "The dwarfs of Ovdal Tungir have proven themselves to be reliable trade partners. They deeply trust us and share their knowledge on a local and a state level. That allowed our merchant spies to easily access crucial information for the Tungeric economy. With enough money we could essentially buy those industries and make them dependent on our economy, essentially revoking their freedom in the process."

 orlghelovar_warding_gate_title:0 "The Warding Gate"
 orlghelovar_warding_gate_desc:0 "In ancient times there was the hold of Verkal Skomdihr. Not only known for their crafts but also for their geographical position. Right outside the hold is a dense forest where the Fey reside in and cause mischief in and outside the forest. To protect against this, they constructed the Warding Gate, blocking the Feys' powers and entries into Aul-Dwarov, but with the fall of the dwarven empire we fear the gate could be wrongly maintained with unknown consequences. Even with the technology required to restore the gate lost in time, we should secure that important position in the Serpentreach."

 orlghelovar_unexplored_wilderness_title:0 "An Unexplored Wilderness"
 orlghelovar_unexplored_wilderness_desc:0 "To our surprise, it seems different races live inside what apparently is named the “Deepwoods”. We received intelligence of elves living inside that region fighting against orcs and goblins just like us. We should lend them a helping hand and reach out to one of those elf countries inside the Deepwoods. Maybe we could make arrangements for a mutually beneficial deal?"

 orlghelovar_gain_new_partners_title:0 "Gain New Partners"
 orlghelovar_gain_new_partners_desc:0 "With our network of diplomatic relations formed on the outside, we can start to look inside the Serpentspine. We are not the only dwarfs inside the spine and many other adventures set off to reclaim it in the name of our ancestors and hold remnants of Aul-Dwarov who survived the Last Days. All of them could be potentially beneficial partners to strengthen our position towards other powers inside and outside the Serpentspine."

 orlghelovar_with_trade_comes_knowledge_title:0 "Trading Knowledge"
 orlghelovar_with_trade_comes_knowledge_desc:0 "When we asked ourselves what we could do to impress the gnomes, we came to the conclusion to impress them through innovations and a strong state. But how could we create such a state in the first place? Cobalt Dwarves all over Orlghelovar argued about that and after a considerable amount of time a solution was found. The Glasshammer fair shows innovations in glassmaking from all over the world. So if we would use our vast network of trading partners and traders all over Cannor and Bulwar, we could use specialists as spies. For that we need to elevate merchants all over Orlghelovar into high ranks to encourage a beneficial position for our state and for them and ensure their loyalty to us."

 orlghelovar_taking_revenge_title:0 "Taking Revenge"
 orlghelovar_taking_revenge_desc:0 "We will never forget what the orcs and the goblins did to our ancestors. If one is to look outwards of Orlghelovar, we can see a domain of goblins right outside our borders. We would normally not care to go out of our way to deal with them but they are a nuisance to our potential growth into the growing trade of the Divenhal and especially cannorian trade."

 orlghelovar_baseless_crusade_title:0 "A Baseless Crusade"
 orlghelovar_baseless_crusade_desc:0 "Once we cleared out the goblins outside of Orlghelovar, we started to face the next problem. We now border an ancient castanorian realm called Ourdia. Decadent and weak it lies in ruins of its former glory. While we don't have a reason to conquer them directly, we need to own the region for our trade to prosper. And since they are lost to fighting the goblins we might as well just take their land while cleaning out goblins on the way."

 orlghelovar_glasshammer_fair_title:0 "The Glasshammer Fair"
 orlghelovar_glasshammer_fair_desc:0 "Our growing trade with cannor started to give us more benefits. With the ships from our newest partnership with Ovdal Tungir, we started trading heavily with big cities in the Empire of Anbennar, especially in Anbenncóst. Recently we were approached with a great idea by a family of glass traders named ‘Glasshammer’. Proud cobalt dwarfs and traders by heart, they want to show off the glory of orlghelovaric glass in all of Cannor. For that they requested [Root.Monarch.GetName] to invest in traders spreading the glory of our ancestors glass in Cannor to increase demands for our highly valuable glass. They would pay for everything related to the actual event which they would hold yearly called ‘The Glasshammer Fair’. The potential rewards are as limitless as the potential to expand it."

 orlghelovar_imperial_innovation_title:0 "Imperial Innovation"
 orlghelovar_imperial_innovation_desc:0 "When it comes to innovativeness there is one factor which is undoubtedly a main driving force for creating new inventions which is competition. One of the most competitive regions in that regard lies in the Empire of Anbennar. Every state within its border is trying to increase its own influence and power, not necessarily through conquest, but rather by gaining an advantage in the technological field. We should harness their drive and support someone's ambition within the empire for his inventions while strengthening our own grip on one of the empire's core cities, Anbenncóst."

 orlghelovar_three_hold_consolidation_desc:0 "The greentide taught us a valuable lesson. The threat lives closer to you than you think.

 orlghelovar_glass_to_divenhal_title:0 "Glass to the Divenhal"
 orlghelovar_glass_to_divenhal_desc:0 "In the days of old, trading with only a handful of people might have sufficed for Orlghelovar but not for us. Bulwari traders sell our glass in the divenhal without us making the biggest profit. It just so befits us that the area outside of Shazstundhir is filled with goblins which gives us a good reason to lay claim to those areas."

 orlghelovar_new_brothers_title:0 "New Brothers"
 orlghelovar_new_brothers_desc:0 "Ovdal Túngir is an ancient hold on the coast of Bahar. They also hold out against the goblins in bulwar but with us clearing them out, we can create something great. An alliance between dwarven brothers can be created. We sell them our glass at good rates and they ship our glass. And since they owe us we can dictate the rates of the glass and ensure we make the biggest profit."

 orlghelovar_normal_sized_geniuses_title:0 "Normal sized Geniuses"
 orlghelovar_normal_sized_geniuses_desc:0 "In the Glasshammer fair there was one innovation visible to every attendee of the event. It wasn't a particular sort of glass or some embarrassing action of an ambassador but rather the people who helped organize it and gave some funds for a dedicated area. They were gnomes who showed off their newest inventions to the public. Not only was their presentation astonishing for us cobalt dwarfs but their ingenuity and will to research for a better tomorrow is what fascinated us. Our wealth and network and their intellect and innovations would make an amazing combination for the years to come. We need to reach out to a big gnomish country to make the necessary arrangements."

 orlghelovar_impress_gnomes_title:0 "Impress the Gnomes"
 orlghelovar_impress_gnomes_desc:0 "While our cooperation with the gnomes increases by the day, they are not nearly enough to have a sizable effect on our whole country. Integration and acceptance of local gnomes is still fairly low. If we want to convince our whole population of the sheer power we will gain by working with the gnomes, we will need to work on our own infrastructure and economy. Not only would our dwarfs be willing to accept the gnomes if they work on those projects, but it would also impress more gnomes to come and join our country solving both issues with one simple solution."

 orlghelovar_a_new_era_title:0 "A New Era"
 orlghelovar_a_new_era_desc:0 "Everything we did in the recent years was to build up for this day. Gnomes are integrated into the structure of our government and work as integral members of our society. Our internal restructuring can begin as we move towards a more scientific state like the Gnomish Hierarchy once was. Our future will be guided by science, supported by dwarfs and gnomes and built upon our ancestors' glass."

Surrounded and partially destroyed by lava and the Greentide, we need to restore and reclaim it for our ancestors. Scouting teams around the area reported large amounts of obsidian around the hold. A perfect opportunity to give purpose to our newest reclaimed hold."

 orlghelovar_begin_excavations_title:0 "Beginn Exacations"
 orlghelovar_begin_excavations_desc:0 "Along the Argrod are several entrances into connected cave systems. Complicated paths filled with pesky goblins make it attractive to venture into them. However, recently there was news about a foundation of a rare material close to the entrance known as the zarnic breach. We should claim the cave system in our name and send an expedition team to investigate the rumors and establish exploitation possibilities."

 orlghelovar_release_vulcano_desc:0 "With many efforts and big investments, we were able to not only restore Gor Burad to his former glory but also to fundamentally restructure its purpose to serve our needs. The lava flow is integrated to help manufacture cheap glass in a unique way only possible with our glass making skills. The black rus from the lava and the ash causes the glass to gain a black shimmer which does not impact the view through the glass. We named it Obsidian Glass, as a memoir of the big obsidian industry also situated in Gor Burad."

After considerable time a solution was found. \n\nOrlghelovar will redirect every non-glass production in Orlghelovar to the people willing to research. It will be guided by a big newly built institute which can be used by everyone willing to learn. The most prestigious and most renowned of scientists can become part of the Enlightened, a council formed to look over the research from their fellow scientists and work in close cooperation with the state to incentivise and directly develop strategies for Orlghelovar. With this council enacted we can start creating research projects in which we will have great interest in."

In cannor there are rumors of a potential invention which makes paper clear itself, making bureaucracy more cost efficient. This inspired our traders and some scientists to create something new based on this invention. A type of paper that can record anything said in close proximity to it and write it down. Simply carrying such a piece would be enough to gather an incredible amount of information. The idea and motivation is already in our possession. Now we only need to create a working version of this self-cleaning parchment."

 orlghelovar_new_trading_policiy_desc:0 "Since the day we ‘bought’ Ovdal Túngir they became ever more integrated into our nation. We reached a point where they are basically just another judicial area of Orlghelovar. They still serve their purpose of being the major trading hub for trade in the Divenhal but not having full control over the area proves to be a burden to us. Because of that, we should enact a new policy towards trade which as a result will fully integrate them into us."

Everyone in Orlghelovar is a glass enthusiast and those working in the glass industry are masters at their craft, but we still do not reach the full potential of glass. We will need new ideas from highly renowned and skilled advisors to solve this issue."

But what it showed us is that working conditions have an effect on the quantity and quality of the glass in more than one way. The natural habit of a dwarf is to hoard wealth and never share it. With this habit of our brethren it seems unlikely to ever change the condition of our glassworkers to increase our production efficiency. But once we get the opportunity for it we should try to push through any kind of rebellion we might face."

Also it is fragile and shatters with minimal force. But that is not how we should look at glass. Recent studies showed that glass evolved with scientific progress and the potential is not yet reached. We should let the enlightened ten guide a lot of scientists towards understanding what exactly glass is in their eyes."

One of them was a big group directly led by one of the enlightened ten to study magic in depth. But rather than inventing new things they said they want to focus on writing down existing knowledge and in doing so increase the knowledge of magic in the whole institute. Such a valuable offer is rare and we have to capitalize on this."

 orlghelovar_finish_university_desc:0 "With an archive of magical knowledge finished and the construction of already planned segments of the institution finished, new plans for yet another addition were drafted. This time a spacious university, built to last the ages and keep knowledge of every invention produced in Orlghelovar safe. But we reached the limits of what our hold can reasonably support without damaging our glass industry. That means we have to reclaim more of our ancestral hold while constructing the university, all while gathering and creating records of inventions planned and already created within our borders."

 orlghelovar_magical_glass_title:0 "Magical Glass"
 orlghelovar_magical_glass_desc:0 "Our recent breakthrough in glass allowed our more creative scientists with invested interest in glass to start tinkering with new types of glass. Similar to alloys they wanted to mix the properties of different materials to create something of a mix. The most promising of them all is what they call “Magical Glass”. It is supposed to be a glass able to amplify magic in various ways through its magical properties. For that it uses very small quantities of Damestear in the smelting process. The idea and the blueprints shown before the council look promising enough that this should be supported by Orlghelovar. They only asked us to secure a steady supply of Damestear, either through trade or our own mines as the quality of the Damestear does not impact the production much."

Our dwarven traders might be used to the oppressive darkness of the cavern and old railways between the holds, but human and elven traders dare not make these journeys with nothing but torches and lanterns to keep the dark at bay. If we are to make these trade routes accessible to the surface races, they need to be well-lit. That is where our artificers come in; they have been working on a new prototype lighting device, powered by a damestear core, that is able to produce light to pierce the darkness of the caverns of the Serpentreach. Now all that we need is working on making it affordable, durable, and long-lasting."

What we do understand however is that gib azhaln plays a vital role in the usage of magic and therefore seems to be the key to understand magic and use it for science using artificery and the likes. Sadly our supply is limited and split between the mages and the artificer which causes issues for us. We need to secure a basic supply from our allies or create a local production for our needs."

Rebels in our country threaten our population, especially the artificers, and blame them for the increase in prices and the tax as a whole. While technically not being a lie they are not the only one to blame. No matter what side is just in this case, this rebellion is a threat to Orlghelovar and therefore has to be quelled! Appeasement can not be done with a knife in our back."

 orlghelovar_ensure_future_stability_desc:0 "The tax had the unforeseen consequence that our realm is now at the brink of collapse. Inhabitants of Orlghelovar do not feel safe anymore as they could be jumped by radicals, be it mages or artificers. This has caused a situation close to an internal civil war. The only way forward is to create a state of stability for now and to do that, we will need close ties to mages and even enlist some for government activities while using some more underhanded tactics for others."

 orlghelovar_revoke_tax_desc:0 "It is time to fix our own mess. While it may have served a cause it is now clear as glass that it was proposed by greedy artificers. If we had only acted earlier we would have gotten away without further damage to Orlghelovar but now it is too late. Even if we revoke it right now, the situation would not change. Instead we have to show our good will to the mages by reinvesting the money gained from the tax and ensure the loyalty of the mages once again. Only then the rebellion can come to an end."

It should be close to our scientific base in Orlghelovar but not directly in the hold itself. \nThe only hold who has a good position is Shazstundhir, a hold without any specialization in the nation of Orlghelovar. This hold shall become the producer of Korrsahi although the predicted produced amount of Korrashi seems to be low for now."

With the discovery of the secret, we can now produce Black Damestear, a material which we have not even begun to understand. Not only do we need dedicated facilities to study this material but also do we need to create areas with black damestear influence to weaken magic and thus allowing more risky projects while also testing the limits of this material.
