 Y25_still_the_winds_title: "Still The Winds"
 Y25_still_the_winds_desc: "The Shuimu League, led by Feiten, is a somewhat newer phenomenon in yanshen when compared to our long reign here. However, This upstart confederation of city states has been growing ever aggresive and expansionist. In the Kingdom of Xiyun, they have recently incited a rebellion. With the backing of the league, the rebels were victorious and have broken away, underneath the authority of the City of Luoyip. The league likely plans on taking the entire kingdom for themselves if they are not put in their place."
 Y25_middle_castes_mission_1_title: "Budding Middle Castes"
 Y25_middle_castes_mission_1_desc: "Owning a port opens up many enticing opportunities for trade and advancing the restoration of our great empire.This was not always the case, however. In the past, there have not been many cities along the coast of Yanshen. Coastal trade was not very profitable or enticing for merchants, leading to small and sparse settlement. For the most part, trade within Yanshen was almost completely either up or down the Yanhe, making the cities that lay along it very wealthy, with Tianlou becoming the largest and wealthiest, as one of the only cities on the coast. However, in the aftermath of Jaher's Campaigns, many refugees fled to the coast and cities began sprouting up. These cities began facilitating trade, and later banded together and formed the Shuimu League, which we recently dealt with. With their power diminished, a vaccum has opened up in coastal trade, and we should take advantage of this."

 Y25_invest_in_the_temples_desc: "The importance in the upkeep and maintenance of the great High Temples cannot be overstated, but the roads leading to them, and the villages that have cropped up near the temples are just as deserving of care. they should all be outfitted with appropriate amenities for visitng adherents, as well as debate halls and centers of discussion for travelling scholars."
 Y25_order_of_the_meticulous_eye_title: "The Meticulous Eye"
 Y25_order_of_the_meticulous_eye_desc: "The High Temples are great sources of inspiration and knowledge for all students of the High Philosophy. Endless amounts of wisdom and guidance and philosophical principles have been imparted on us by scholars of the temples; however, to this day, noone is quite sure what purpose the high temples served. What was their purpose? How did they function in order to serve that purpose? The high gods were wise enough to achieve enlightenment, so surely these structures served some grand purpose. That is what we seek to discover. To that end, we will found a new order of scholars, the brightest minds in yanshen, dedicated to researching the temples."
 Y25_the_heavenly_towers_title: "The Heavenly Towers"
 Y25_the_heavenly_towers_desc: "Tianlou; the most important city in the histories of both high philosophy itself, and our dynasty. It was here Harimar conquered to, it was here that he ruled, and it is here that the greatest complex of high temples in all of haless lies. It is here in the heavenly towers that harimar vanished. With the order of scholars founded, their first task is the studious investigation of the high temples. for over a millenia, the many students of the high philosphy have venerated the high temples, with the goal of attaining enlightenment. But very few have studied what it was exactly that the temples did. What is their function? what was their function back in the days when the high gods were still bound to this lower existence? our great philosphers and scholars will be thinking hard, and studying carefuly, and respectfuly."
 
 Y25_an_exercise_in_diplomacy_title: "An Excercise in Diplomacy"
 Y25_an_exercise_in_diplomacy_desc: "One of the most important traits in a Liangzhu is the ability to negotiate and navigate complicated situations with ease. A silver tongue with the ability to ease tension and come to reasonable agreements that are fair to all parties. Our current heir demonstrated these qualities in their examinations and is a very promising candidate for Liangzhu. In order to even better prepare them for the exceedingly important task of ruling, we should let them gain experience firsthand; We shall utilize their skills by sending them on diplomatic missions to nearby nations, a true testament to their skill, and hopefuly a sign of great things to come."
 Y25_stern_diplomacy_title: "Stern Diplomacy"
 Y25_stern_diplomacy_desc: "Strength of will, assertiveness, steadfastness; these are qualities sometimes underlooked in diplomats, but if one is to be truly just and fair, one must not back down in negotiations. We know our worth, and we know what is just and what is fair. Our diplomats will not only embody the common qualities of persuasiveness, compassion, and kindness, but must also be stern and unwavering in their integrity."

 Y25_an_exercise_in_ambition_desc: "One of the most important traits in a Liangzhu is ambition. One must always seek to become stronger, faster, smarter, better in some way. The Lianzghu must seek the betterment of not only himself but of the realm, and the people beneath it. The Liangzhu must have a clear, resolute vision for the future, a vision guided by the strict moral codes infused in them, that they will stop at nearly nothing to achieve. The future of Yanshen itself is ripe for the taking, and the Liangzhu will use their skills to make sure that it is THEIR vision that becomes reality."
 Y25_demand_respect_title: "Demand Respect"
 Y25_demand_respect_desc: "It is no secret that we have not been taken seriously for quite some time. We have been percieved as a joke to the population of Yanshen for nearly a milenia. this injustice has gone on for far too long. if people are to take us seriously again, we need to prove to them that we are not a force to be messed with, and not as much of a joke as we have come to be seen as. We need to show them all the power of Zongji and demand the respect that we are due."
 Y25_recognition_title: "Recognition"
 Y25_recognition_desc: "We have begun to prove ourselves to the people of yanshen; we have been strong, willful, and stern. We have made it clear that we are not to be messed with. It was neccesary to use shows of force and might to get this far, but that is not how we wish to be viewed; we are not conquerers, we are not bullies, and we are not tyrants. Now that yanshen knows to respect us, we need not forcefuly subjugate them; by being steadfast allies, great friends, trustworthy confidants, and benevolent rulers, the people of Yanshen will willingly swear fealty to us. We must still remain strong, and assertive, and willful, but these are traits that others will look up to us for, and not resent us for. Soon enough, the eunuchs will be bowing before us in the great capital of Tianlou once more."

With Tianlou in our control, we have real authority. for the first time in over a milleniia. The rest of yanshen shall bow before their rightful rulers, and submit to the true emperors of Yanshen. Our benevolent Liangzhu has been gracious towards its subjects, and they bow willingly out of respect for our rule; we had once lost their respect, but now that we have proven ourselves, they willingly return to our embrace. If they do not bow willingly, then they will be forced to. They will bow, and proclaim as a message for all their brethren to hear; The Emperors of Yanshen have returned."

 Y25_an_exercise_in_understanding_desc: "All around us, there are people with differing religions and views and philosophies and ways of thinking; but this is not neccesarily a bad thing. One of the most important traits in a Liangzhu is to be understanding of differences, and to seek out common ground where it can be found. An understanding and empathetic LIangzhu comes to be percieved by others not only as strong and wise, but as benevolent and friendly. We should be sure to invite a scholar from another school of high philosophy to our nation for friendly debate and discussion."

 Y25_laying_the_groundwork_title: "Laying the Groundwork"
 Y25_laying_the_groundwork_desc: "When Harimar of the Divine Call disappeared, his empire eventually split. We are the descendants of the great eastern half of his empire, known as Lianzhou. We held dominion over Yanshen for many centuries, but endured a diappointing and regretable decline due to mismanagement. The other half of Harimar's empire, the Harimraj, not only maintained its authority and rule for 4 centuries longer than we did but also underwent a resurgence with the founding of the 2nd Harimraj in the year 1312, which saw it once more solidly in control of Rahen. Many of our Liangzhu have pondered why the Harimraj saw so much more success than we did, and in the year 1131, 181 years before the founding of the 2nd Harimraj, Yatasuo of the Divine Call left for Rahen and returned with his answer. Even in its shattered state, the warlords of Rahen were powerful and demanded respect. Strict adherence to the caste system allowed the rulers much greater control over their subjects than otherwise, ensuring much greater stability in the realm. And so our plan was formalized establish control over Yanshen via the implimentation of the Raheni Caste System. However, we cannot simply expect to enforce this without major pushback; for this reason, we need to take certain precautions and compromises to ensure revolts do not happen and that unrest remains low."
 Y25_eunuch_integration_decree_title: "Decree of Integration"
 Y25_eunuch_integration_decree_desc: "Upon conquering Yanshen, the great and wise Harimar of the Divine Call uprooted the entrenched kingdoms and nobility in the region. He devised and implimented the system of eunuch governance and administration utilized throughout Yanshen to this day. It is of great importance to his legacy that we respect his wishes and his vision, but we have hit the issue of how exactly the system of euncuh administration is going to work alongside the proposed Yansheni Caste System. However, this is not actually as large of an issue as it seems. Rahen's caste system is entrenched in millenia of tradition and changes to it are nigh impossible to achieve without great upheaval. Our system has only just begun, and we have all the freedom in the world to adapt it to our needs and our vision. We are in a unique position here, in which we can create the exact system we desire, without resistance and without restraint. Thus, the question of how eunuchs can possibly fit into the caste system is solved; simply because we have designed it so, any who undergo the procedure, recieve training from an acreddited eunuch academy, and enter into the service of our administration are considered part of the upper caste, with all of the benefits that come with it. Those who enter particularly high positions will be compensated particularly well, with family members able to join them in status and recieve free training for any career in the upper caste that they wish.

 flavour_zongji.1.d: "The Finding of the Liangzhu has passed, all the eligible scions of the Clan $DYNASTY$ have presented themselves and been examined by our greatest scholars and wisest elders. But whom has passed the exams with the greatest score? The papers have been laid out before us. Nowe we must decide."

 flavour_zongji.1.dd: "Wisdom is a trait most desirable in a ruler."
 
 flavour_zongji.2.t: "City of Warlords"
 flavour_zongji.2.d: "The city of Jiangdu now submits to us. Many among our upper caste find the climate more suitable for their tastes; Warriors patrol the streets and train and perform drills in their garrisons, while our administrators fill new posts opened up related to governing the relations between the city and our state. For the most part, we have let most administrators keep their positions, and in a gesture of good will, we are letting the city retain its stratocratic systems. However, in our dealings with the city, the topic has come up of a special arrangement being reached. Most forms of the proposal entail an exchange. We are to retake all of the lands that Jiangdu lost during the course of the Blue Scarves rebellion, and transfer control of the area to their governance. In exchange, Jiangdu will help us achieve this goal in the best way they can; by offering us some of their brightest military minds to the cause. We are under no obligation to pursue this arrangement, and these ideas could simply die out over time, but if we wished, entering into this arrangemet and keeping our promises would assuredly make the administrators of Jiangdu very loyal and supportive of all of our endeavors in the future."

 flavour_zongji.3.d: "In the agreement set forth between our government and the local government of the city of Jiangdu, we made a bargain in which we promised to grant the city full control over the territories it held prior to the revolt of Lanjinhui. Now that we have reconquered the area, it is time for us to fulfill our end of the bargain. Of course, we could alter the deal, but this would upset relations with them greatly."

 flavour_zongji.6.a: "Excellent."

 flavour_zongji.7.t: "Undying Flame"
 flavour_zongji.7.d: "We have finally, after a long and arduous millenium, found ourselves back in control of Jiantsiang. It was first established by us in 98 AA as a garrison on the northern frontier of our empire, to bravely protect Yanshen from bandits and to stop shuvuush incrusions from reaching deeper into the region. As our empire began collapsing, we eventually lost control over the region.\n\nYet over 1000 years after our empire collapsed, Jiantsiang has survived, and at times, thrived. Their great brazier, the Undying Flame, still burns as red as Tigersblood Rubies, and it is a true testament to the strength and tenacity of Harimari all over Yanshen that it does so. Under our rule, we will ensure that the brazier continues to burn, and that northern Yanshen will continue to be safe and sound.\n\nThe valiant warriors of Jiantsiang happen to fall within the upper castes in our new order, and for their service, they will be granted estates, and solidified as some of the most prestigious warrior families in Yanshen.\nThe Shrewd Merchants of Jiantsiang, Gemcarvers and merchants, in the lucrative ruby trade, will be a part of the middle castes, with easy access to our whole empire, a grand expansion on the trade of these blood red rubies.\nAnd you cannot forget the Harimari in the fields of the frontier, providing food for the garisson and risking their lives living near the shuvuush border, or the harimari in the mines extracting the rubies for refinement. They will fit into the lower castes, their endurance and strength invaluable to our order, and our vision."
 flavour_zongji.7.a: "All will fit into our vision."
