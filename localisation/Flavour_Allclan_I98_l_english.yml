 estate_artificers_organization_discombobulatorium:0 "Artificer Organization: Discombobulatorium"
 estate_artificers_organization_discombobulatorium_desc:0 "This country is subject to the brilliantly absurd and spontaneous Discombobulatorium, the Allclan's conclave of artificers. Despite their laughable demeanor, these great goblins hold considerable sway within the Pentapandemonium, and should their research be disturbed, are not afraid to use it."

 pentapandemonium_reform: "The Pentapandemonium"
 pentapandemonium_reform_desc: "Most would argue that a state operates most efficiently in the world of law, order, and peace. That the absence of these things leads to anarchy, upon which no progress can be made. But have no fear. We've laughed the sorry sods spreading this misinformation out of the ceremony!\n\nChaos shall reign supreme under the unnoble leadership of the five Pentapandemoniac Prefectoriums: the ever-brilliant artificers of the Discombobulatorium, the omnipresent life of the party known as the Harmaceuticals (shortened to Big Harma), the sly and cunning Cloak and Swagger prefectorium, the constructive Glorious Erectors, and the simple backwater Clodhoppers. These five prefectoriums working in utter disharmony are certain to bring prosperity to Ves Udzenklan... right?"

 pen_discombobulatorium:0 "The Discombobulatorium"
 pen_discombobulatorium_influence:0 "Discombobulatorium Influence"
 pen_discombobulatorium_FACTION_DESC:0 "Composed of the most brilliant minds of the Pentapandemonium, the Discombobulatorium is the high "council" of artificers that governs all explosive tomfoolery and shenaniganry within these borders. Discombobulators also make horrible neighbors. Don't leave them alone with your pet. I look away for one second, and suddenly my dog was turbo-encabulated. I'm still not even sure what that means."
 pen_erectors:0 "The Glorious Erectors"
 pen_erectors_influence:0 "Glorious Erector Influence"
 pen_erectors_FACTION_DESC:0 "Born of the Massive Shaft Renaissance, the Glorious Erectors are the starving artists of Ves Udzenklan, creating both wonders and horrors of architecture on a daily basis. Even when there is nothing to build, the Erectors will find some project to busy themselves with, often to the dismay of the populace at large. On my typical route to work, I was surprised to find a fully-stocked sewage treatmant plant had been constructed. Overnight. Directly in the road. I was late to work that day, and all subsequent days since."
 pen_clodhoppers:0 "The Clodhoppers"
 pen_clodhoppers_influence:0 "Clodhopper Influence"
 pen_clodhoppers_FACTION_DESC:0 "In a sea of sheer ludicrousness, the Clodhoppers manage to provide some anchor to reality, which is sad considering that they are perhaps the rowdiest of all the Pentapandemoniac Prefectoriums. The Clodhoppers fill the important niche in society of dealing with the dangerous denizens of the dark, acting as the spider-riding beast-brawling ranchers of the Serpentspine. They are also all armed to the teeth, without exception."
 pen_harmaceuticals:0 "The Harmaceuticals"
 pen_harmaceuticals_influence:0 "Harmaceutical Influence"
 pen_harmaceuticals_FACTION_DESC:0 "Looking for a fix? Well the Harmaceuticals can provide something similar, assuming you aren't too concerned with your personal well-being. Few residents of Ves Udzenklan are, after all. The Harmaceuticals, or "Big Harma" as they're better known, handle some of the most important jobs for any functioning nation: the production and sale of drugs. And other things, on occasion."
 pen_cloak_and_swagger:0 "The Cloak and Swaggers"
 pen_cloak_and_swagger_influence:0 "Cloak and Swagger Influence"
 pen_cloak_and_swagger_FACTION_DESC:0 "The Cloak and Swaggers represent the tough, the sneaky, and the fabulous. This Prefectorium handles all facets of war and espionage, staffing our armies and spying on our enemies. And looking incredible while doing it."

 PREFECT: "Prefect"
