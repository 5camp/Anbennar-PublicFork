flavor_blackbeard.1.t:0 "Blackbeard Cartel"
flavor_blackbeard.1.d:0 "Dwosgraeg was sitting on a small rock surrounded by the bodies of dead goblins, cleaning his axe with a rag that he had ripped off of one of the less unkempt looking creatures. Around him other dwarves were sifting through bodies for any loose valuables and setting up a perimeter watch. The Cartel was a well oiled machine by now, barely needing Dwosgraegs’ input to function. He finished cleaning and looked around more closely. They had arrived in what looked to be an old hamlet built on the side of the rail track and had taken care of its previous occupiers. He surmised it was a fine place to rest a while before continuing deeper into the tunnels.\n\nIt had been at least a year since they had first set foot into the Serpentspine. When he was little Dwosgraeg was always fascinated by the mythical mountain range and its vast networks of caves and tunnels. Fighting in the dark depths like the dwarven heroes of old had always been one of his greatest dreams, and now he was living that dream and it was everything he had hoped for: close quarters, tight spaces, devilish ambush locations; fighting side-by-side as an impenetrable shield wall; enemies around every corner. He had never felt so alive while fighting under the sun in Escann or in the Empire. His enemies were also more in their element here, the goblins using their small stature to great effect. He relished the challenge.\n\nA burst of laughter erupted from behind Dwosgraeg. He turned to look and saw some of the dwarves were tossing spears at a corpse they had moved to be leaning on a wall. They were also saying something but Dwosgraeg did not care to listen. He approached the commotion and spoke up: “I thought I have been clear that corpses are not playthings?” All eyes were on him now. “Sir, this is not play, this is…” “Another word from you and I’ll cut your tongue clean off. I was thinking of resting here for a while but it seems there is enough energy to keep marching.” He saw some folks that had already taken their packs out shoot glares at the spear throwers. He knew that his imposing presence and unmatched skill was the only thing truly uniting this band of warrior dwarves. They were not here because some rich noble had paid them or because of homesickness. They were here to fight, loot and adventure.\n\nAfter a sufficiently long silence Dwosgraeg gave the order."
