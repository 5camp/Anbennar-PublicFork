 R52_claws_extended_title:0 "Claws Extended"
 R52_claws_extended_desc:0 "The tiger must know when to extend or retract its claws if it is to survive in the jungle. So it is with the Raj, and so it shall be with us."

 R52_finish_our_meal_title:0 "Finish Our Meal"
 R52_finish_our_meal_desc:0 "Years ago, the Grand Vizier Manava seized Nabukh from Saddathar. The weakened rump state left behind poses a substantial security risk to the Raj as it is unable to defend the eastern flank of the Raja's Vajiya holdings. It will be best if we consolidate the region ourselves."

 R52_the_farmer_and_the_herdsman_title:0 "Farmer and Herdsman"
 R52_the_farmer_and_the_herdsman_desc:0 "The great textile city of Vajiya is supplied by vast cotton fields to its west, currently controlled by the Prabhi of Setapsim. These fields are highly vulnerable to raids and illegal grazing by the Tudhina. It is crucial that we safeguard the supply chain for this critical imperial revenue stream."

 R52_a_reliable_partner_title:0 "A Reliable Partner"
 R52_a_reliable_partner_desc:0 "Our efforts over the last few years have placed the Raja in one of his most secure positions. What better way to celebrate this partnership than a party?"

 R52_investigate_disloyalty_title:0 "Investigate Disloyalty"
 R52_investigate_disloyalty_desc:0 "Unfortunately, few of the Raja's subjects share our spirit of devotion and service. We must know of plots against the Lotus Throne before they happen -- it is time to expand the reach of our eyes and ears."

 R52_challenge_the_courts_title:0 "Challenge the Courts"
 R52_challenge_the_courts_desc:0 "We have assembled considerable evidence of insufficient loyalty and loose speech against the Raja amongst the courts of the realm. Laying out the case against this spirit of casual treason will ruffle some fur, but it cannot be allowed to fester."

 R52_illuminate_the_raj_title:0 "Illuminate the Raj"
 R52_illuminate_the_raj_desc:0 "Our foes accused us of self-dealing and fabricating evidence, but in time our program has revealed the presence of enemies of the state at all levels of society. We have been proven right -- and the Raj is safer for it."

 R52_a_beacon_of_light_title:0 "A Beacon of Light"
 R52_a_beacon_of_light_desc:0 "All now look to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for guidance and moral leadership, and even our foes recognize the incomparable weight of our Vizierate's authority. Our ceaseless efforts have banished the Raj's age of darkness and restored light to the realm."

 R52_the_eastern_fields_title:0 "The Eastern Fields"
 R52_the_eastern_fields_desc:0 "East of Rabhidaraj lies the agrarian region of Satarsaya. Much of this land is divided up between squabbling landlords, and their corrupt overreach is one of the best examples of how the weakness of society's prevailing morality is failing the common people. Let us restore it to a state of order and justice to serve as an example to the realm."

 R52_secure_the_supply_chain_title:0 "Secure the Supply Chain"
 R52_secure_the_supply_chain_desc:0 "The cotton fields of Inner Rahen supply the paper mills of Dhenijansar, creating the famous cotton paper that has become almost synonymous with the Raja's administrators and ministries. As it is so vital to the proper functioning of the state apparatus, it is only sensible to ensure these fields are directly controlled by the central government."

 R52_one_raj_one_vizier_title:0 "One Raj, One Vizier"
 R52_one_raj_one_vizier_desc:0 "Prior to the ascension of Grand Vizier Manava, it was the Senapti of Amtujsaat that historically held the Raj's highest office. Under their leadership, the Raj decayed into its present state of decadent rot. Even now, scores of corrupt officials and noblemen yearn for the return of the Amtujsaat Vizierate. We must crush their existence as an alternative center of power."

 R52_codes_of_the_sun_title:0 "Codes of the Sun"
 R52_codes_of_the_sun_desc:0 "Others mock the Radiant Sun school for its uncompromising moralism only because they have not yet experienced what it means to live in a society of just people. The use of the Vizierate to promulgate new moral laws and encourage the formation of a virtuous citizenry is a key plank in our plan to restore the glory of Harimar's empire."

 R52_warriors_of_light_title:0 "Warriors of Light"
 R52_warriors_of_light_desc:0 "As part of our moral reform regime, we have instituted a strict but fair system of military justice. While other armies loot and pillage their way across the countryside, those flying the banner of the Bloody Claw know they fight for order and righteousness. A soldier of such virtue will always face the battle with more determination than one who fights for mere self-interest."

 R52_knife_in_the_dark_title:0 "A Knife in the Dark"
 R52_knife_in_the_dark_desc:0 "Our transformation of the Raj is nearly complete -- but it seems that even as we build a more moral society in the countryside, the halls of power are yet haunted by the decadence and self-dealing corruption of the Lotus Court. The Raja has proven resistant to joining the cause of righteous valor. Surely the greater good justifies the smaller evil of seizing control?"

 R52_lay_the_bait_title:0 "Lay the Bait"
 R52_lay_the_bait_desc:0 "Simply sniffing around and attempting to catch the trail of traitors and criminals cannot possibly deal with a problem the size of the one facing the Raj today. We must actively lure them out with the promise of a fantastically lucrative yet highly illegal bargain with the Vizier's brother."

 R52_cleanse_the_filth_title:0 "Cleanse the Filth"
 R52_cleanse_the_filth_desc:0 "Our scheme has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. The band of criminals we captured was just the start -- our determined investigators have compelled these cretins into revealing their contacts across local high society."

 R52_light_the_shadows_title:0 "Light the Shadows"
 R52_light_the_shadows_desc:0 "As we suspected, the rot reaches ever higher. While it is horrifying to learn from the confessions of disgraced noble leaders that they were directly aided by a Senapti, it is gratifying to get closer and closer to ripping the corruption out by its roots."

 R52_begin_the_cleansing_title:0 "Begin the Cleansing"
 R52_begin_the_cleansing_desc:0 "The ministries were once a beacon of fairness and justice. In the days when they were truly institutions of merit alone, the administrative state worked for the good of the realm alone. Now, however, it has become infected with parasites and the scions of decadent houses. We must remove the infestation lest the whole structure come crumbling down."

 R52_behold_the_dawn_title:0 "Behold the Dawn"
 R52_behold_the_dawn_desc:0 "Our program of ministerial reform was derided as reckless and needlessly inflammatory, but even the skeptics are taken aback by how remarkably effective the civil service has become after we purged it of its leeches."

 R52_a_viziers_lament_title:0 "A Vizier's Lament"
 R52_a_viziers_lament_desc:0 "Our school, the Radiant Sun, has always seen sinfulness and hypocrisy in the courts of the Raj. However, the full scale of this wretched enterprise only became clear to Manava of the Bloody Claw after his ascension to the Vizierate. Perhaps the Raja merely needs to be shown that a better world is possible?"

 R52_traveling_poets_title:0 "Traveling Poets"
 R52_traveling_poets_desc:0 "Our mission to transform society will require persuading the common people that they have a key role to play in building a nation of virtue. We ought to dispatch traveling poets to bring our message to the masses through their beautiful verse."

 R52_seven_tales_of_rot_title:0 "Seven Tales of Rot"
 R52_seven_tales_of_rot_desc:0 "The 'tale of rot' is an emerging literary genre created by our cadre of traveling poets. In it, they detail the lurid stories of corruption and decadence they have observed and castigate the upper class for failing to prevent it. Now, a group of scholars has edited a collection of seven of these tales. We should ensure the widespread circulation of these tomes."

 R52_scholars_of_radiance_title:0 "Scholars of Radiance"
 R52_scholars_of_radiance_desc:0 "The Radiant Sun has not historically enjoyed the scale and breadth of academic discourse as the other schools. We can correct this by establishing a central hub from which the scholars of radiance can work toward perceiving ever closer approximations of true righteousness."

 R52_the_colorbound_tomes_title:0 "Colorbound Tomes"
 R52_the_colorbound_tomes_desc:0 "The close link between the scholars of the Radiant Sun and our own rising power in the Raj has reinvigorated our school, filling our brightest minds with the sense of possibility that comes only from proximity to power. The so-called 'colorbound tomes' are the bound codices of foundational writings that have come out of Parusapa in recent years, notable for the vibrant, bright covers created with Parusapa's famous dyes."

 R52_the_solar_altar_title:0 "The Solar Altar"
 R52_the_solar_altar_desc:0 "The Radiant Sun was formed when the scholars of the High Philosophy were exposed to Bulwari theology following Jaher's conquest. Though we do not in any way disavow the great contributions of our ancestors, the people need a living, breathing god to bind them together. Let them turn to Surael, whose brilliant radiance casts away the shadow and turns the focus of all to the path of righteousness."

 R52_parusapa_conclave_title:0 "Parusapa Conclave"
 R52_parusapa_conclave_desc:0 "There can be no doubt that our reforms have brought considerable religious upheaval, a regrettable byproduct of necessary change. Nevertheless, the time has come to provide a clear and stable path forward. We should summon the brightest minds of both Bulwari theology and our own indigenous scholars together to discuss and debate the matters at hand."

 R52_patronize_commentaries_title:0 "Patronize Commentaries"
 R52_patronize_commentaries_desc:0 "The Bloody Claw watches the scholars of the Radiant Sun carefully for those who show signs of promising, innovative thought. We should uplift these key individuals and provide them the resources they need to continue producing their work."

 R52_a_most_delicate_art_title:0 "A Most Delicate Art"
 R52_a_most_delicate_art_desc:0 "Dyemaking, known in Parusapa as 'the delicate art', requires not just competence and dexterity, but also patience and calmness of mind. In this way, it is an industry that by its very nature rewards virtue -- a fitting backbone for Rabhidaraj's fiscal future. The greatest limitation on growing the industry is simply that there is not enough demand for dyes, but control of cotton and the resulting textiles should solve that problem."

 R52_parade_in_black_and_red_title:0 "Parade in Black and Red"
 R52_parade_in_black_and_red_desc:0 "The uniforms of the Bloody Claw cut a striking figure, the brilliant black and red dyes serving as a stunning advertisement both of our martial prowess and of our precious goods. Why build such a beautiful army if you aren't going to show it off?"

 R52_ravinandan_method_title:0 "Ravinandan Method"
 R52_ravinandan_method_desc:0 "Ravinandan was a Parusapa dyemaster and a contemporary of Grand Vizier Manava who created a vastly improved method of coloring paper. Suddenly, the creation of ornate and intricate illustrations was both more affordable and much more appealing. This method has been slowly percolating through the industry in local circles, but with our direct intervention, the surging demand for our products would bring great wealth to both Rabhidaraj and the Raja."

 R52_resplendent_finery_title:0 "Resplendent Finery"
 R52_resplendent_finery_desc:0 "Though the innovations in paper dyeing have proven to be the most economically profound, it is the way the imperial clothiers have improved the process of dyeing cloth that allows our dignitaries to so easily outshine those of other courts at every function."
 #Events:
 rabhidaraj_events.1.t:0 "Lord of the Feast"
 rabhidaraj_events.1.d:0 "Every few years the Tudhinai hold a grand feast to celebrate the relationship between Raja and Prabhi, a tradition which goes back all the way to the conquests of Harimar. Some feared that we would end this long tradition now that we are the rightful overlords of the Tudhinai shepherds.\n\nThey need not have worried. A feast which serves a virtuous purpose, like binding together the Raja and his subjects, is not an unacceptable or sinful frivolity like many of the grand parties and feasts of the empire. Instead, we have chosen to celebrate and highlight our partnership with the Raja by turning this year's feast into the grandest that ever was. At that feast, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was publicly thanked by the Raja for his loyal and useful service, which has restored imperial power to its highest point in many years."
 rabhidaraj_events.1.a:0 "Enjoy, in celebration of the realm!"
 
 rabhidaraj_events.2.t:0 "Lamentation Before the Sun"
 rabhidaraj_events.2.d:0 "'Every morning my shame rises with you\nFor I know we have soiled your eyes'\n     -excerpt from the Lamentation Before the Sun\n\nLast year, a mysterious epic known as the Lamentation Before the Sun began a circuit of performances among the Parusapa nobility, decrying the state of the empire and how its officials have looted the common people while ignoring their cries for order and safety. The other Prabhia and Senaptia have reacted with incredulity, demanding an investigation into the identity of the author so they might be punished for treason.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has instead defended the piece, inviting the Raja to a performance at the court in Parusapa. After the performance, the tears in the emperor's eyes confirmed that he, too, understood what had become of Harimar's legacy. The two spent the long hours of the night lamenting the state of the empire before swearing to one another that they would purge corrupt elements, heal institutions, and restore the glory of the Harimraj."
 rabhidaraj_events.2.a:0 "At last, he sees the light!"
 
 rabhidaraj_events.3.t:0 "The Setapsim Affair"
 rabhidaraj_events.3.d:0 "The Raja and [Root.Monarch.GetName] were in Setapsim evaluating the progress of the cotton harvest that was bound for Vajiya when they were assaulted by a team of harimari assassins. The ferocity and power of our response shocked them, with the Vizier personally slaying three of the assassins in defense of the Raja.\n\nThough some claim the attack is suspicious due to its political convenience for our faction, we know that it is little surprise for the forces of evil to conduct themselves this way. Fortunately, the evidence we have produced has convinced the Raja of our enemies' guilt, even if the empire as a whole does not necessarily believe us."
 rabhidaraj_events.3.a:0 "His opinion is all that matters."
 
 rabhidaraj_events.4.t:0 "Parusapa Moralism"
 rabhidaraj_events.4.d:0 "Parusapa Moralism was a theologico-political movement that began in the city of Parusapa in the early 15th century, most commonly associated with the Radiant Sun school of the High Philosophy. While the Rabhidaraj Vizierate was never formally associated with the movement, large amounts of correspondence between its foremost thinkers and the Grand Vizier Manava have been discovered, suggesting that the local authorities were deeply sympathetic to the movement.\n\nIn general, it believed that the primary purpose of the state was to construct a society in which people would be reshaped into virtuous citizens. It made the further claim that a successful society and a virtuous public were nearly synonymous, with the mere achievement of material prosperity or martial dominance being nothing more than hollow vanities. The movement was broadly critical of many trends in contemporary Raheni society and attracted a wide array of enemies and critics. Though the movement's most ardent supporters could be found among relatively well-educated harimari who had nevertheless found themselves on the wrong side of the established social order, it was the official protection of the Rabhidaraj Vizierate that ensured the continued public force of the movement. As a result, the movement's fortunes were largely tied to those of the Bloody Claw."
 rabhidaraj_events.4.a:0 "An idea is the most powerful force."

 rabhidaraj_events.5.t:0 "The Cult of Surael"
 rabhidaraj_events.5.d:0 "When the worship of Surael was imported into Rahen by the Rabhidaraj Vizierate and their allies in the Radiant Sun school, some feared that it would result in a wholesale adoption of Bulwari religion. However, the new 'Cult of Surael' did not go quite that far. Instead, they used Surael as a personification and focal point for their values of a stable and prosperous society.\n\nMost art from the early Suraelist era included one of three depictions of the god. The first portrayed him as an aging patriarch whose manner toward his children was equal parts firmness and compassion. In the second, Surael was a valiant warrior protecting the weak and defenseless from hordes of adversaries. In the final depiction, Surael was shown as a great wizard and intellectual, capable of fantastic feats of both magical and mental prowess. However, only one depiction would dominate later in the Suraelist period."
 rabhidaraj_events.5.a:0 "Surael the Father"
 rabhidaraj_events.5.b:0 "Surael the Warrior"
 rabhidaraj_events.5.c:0 "Surael the Wise"
 
 rabhidaraj_events.6.t:0 "The Parusapa Conclave"
 rabhidaraj_events.6.d:0 "More than a hundred dignitaries, and thousands of their attendants, have descended on Parusapa in the last few weeks. The question put before them was simple -- what should the theological future of Rabhidaraj be? Of course, all in attendance know that at stake is not merely the personal religious beliefs of a handful of Bloody Claw elites, but also the religious leanings of the entire Harimraj. Each day, the mood in the meeting room seems to be even more tense than the day before. It is clear that no single compromise will be reached, and instead the attendees have gravitated toward three possible solutions.\n\nThe first set of delegates preach a wholesale conversion to the Jadd, pointing out the obvious similarities between its teachings and the beliefs of the Radiant Sun school's Moralist movement. The second counsel a more moderate approach, syncretizing many aspects of the various Suraelist sects with reverence for the High Gods and the old philosophies, giving Surael a new place as lord of the High Gods. The final group, including most prominently the delegates from Rahen itself, have begun pushing the idea that the Radiant Sun school should treat Surael as a useful personification of the righteous path they truly worship, realigning itself with the High Philosophy and securing its place as the most prominent of all the schools. The impasse will only be broken when [Root.Monarch.GetName] makes a decision."
 rabhidaraj_events.6.a:0 "The Jadd rings of truth."
 rabhidaraj_events.6.b:0 "Further integrate worship of Surael."
 rabhidaraj_events.6.c:0 "We are stewards of the High Philosophy."
