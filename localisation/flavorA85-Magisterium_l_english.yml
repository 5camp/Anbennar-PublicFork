 magisterium.2.t:0 "Diverging opinions"
 magisterium.2.d:0 "The logistics of the operation put in place, two divergent opinions appeared among the leaders of the operation.

Although most of these buildings are unusable or worthless, one of them, strangely well preserved, marked the attention of the expedition, which now directs all its efforts this strange building."
 magisterium.5.a:0 "Onward !"
 
 magisterium.6.t:0 "Laboratory"
 magisterium.6.d:0 "Once the entrance of what looked like a temple piercing, and its strange magic golems turned off, what looks like a temple, turns out to be actually a laboratory, filled with all kinds of curiosity dating from an age well older than anyone here present. With this discovery, the expedition finally comes to an end, allowing the Magisterium to access a whole lot of new knowledge and relics."

The blast of the explosion destroying all the preemptive barriers set up, shaving plains and hills, tearing jungle and forest, vitrifying the sand, liquefying the rock. But no matter the means employed, the result is there: The largest Damestear deposit on the planet. Radiant with a twilight glow, defying the beauty of the most beautiful women on the planet."
