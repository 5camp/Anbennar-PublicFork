Then it rested, and many tried to ignore it, as if it never happened and it never would come again.\n\nOh how wrong they were.\n\nWhen it returned, it was at night, and it reached past the ears of the townsfolk and into their minds; it was a horrid scream, a cursed wail, the shriek of a baby and the scream of a man in pain all at the same time. The strongest pressed their hands up to their ears so hard they were nearly crushed, those that could not found their eyes vibrating as their noses bled, and the least fortunate were left drooling on the floor--their eyes whited out, their lives lost.\n\nWhen the wails ended, the people closest to the chilling song were changed irreparably, and seek only to leave, to leave with at least some of their sanity intact."

The townsfolk could only watch as the man, a family member of a house of grim repute, further mangled themselves against their own will, helpless and unable to do anything as the tar filled their eyes, and his strained screaming filled their ears.\n\nThe man then lay there, silent, still in a crumpled heap as guardsmen surrounded it. Seconds pass, then minutes, and it seemed like the nightmare--horrific as it was--was over as quickly as it began... until it started shifting again...\n\nWith a cursed yell, a sound many still can picture with perfect clarity to now, it returned, an unnatural calmness slathered on every cursed syllable it spewed. It twisted its head to the side and began to speak of the future, of bleak skies and plague, of flames and hordes of the soulless, before ending his tirade with a laugh that twisted the mind as much as it twisted its own body."

The origins of this blight are uncertain: perhaps a vile necromancer lost control of their servants, or an ancient curse has been released. Regardless, the dark corners of [Root.GetName] will be unsafe until the creatures are dealt with. While the remedies of Garion the Wise can be used to prevent further infection, this will become a problem if left to spiral out of control."

  aw_zombies.13.d:0 "Once a horde of zombies grows to sufficient size, it becomes particularly difficult to quarantine, as individuals who are bitten but escape being torn apart by the creatures invariably flee towards unaffected areas in the hope of finding a cure. All too often, these people die and reanimate before they can be helped, only succeeding in spreading the plague further. This appears to be the situation in [Root.GetName], as zombies and infected individuals spill over the border from [From.GetName], bringing a strain of the White Pestilence with them."

Outriders and abjurers prevented any stragglers from fleeing the inferno, holy chants and lances driving back the abominations. By the time the sun rose there was nothing left of the horde other than ash."

Except in very dry or clean conditions, zombies break down relatively quickly after their animation, the elements claiming the body as surely as if it had been buried beneath six feet of earth. Without a constant supply of new victims to reanimate, a zombie infestation normally burns out after several months due to natural decomposition.

The mages believe that they can seize control of the undead in [Root.GetName] with relatively little risk to themselves, and from there lead them into traps where they can be easily dispatched. However, they would like assurances that their use of these powers will be free of consequences - and would like the crown to do them several small favors in the future.
