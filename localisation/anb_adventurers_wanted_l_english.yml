  aw_trolls.0.d:0 "For most people, trolls are known for two things: their grotesque noses, and their impressive regenerative abilities that make them incredibly difficult to kill.\n\nBut for those who have lived among trolls, there is a greater peril in their existence within a province's ecosystem. Due to their large size and regenerative abilities trolls have no natural threat in the wild they are apex predators. Leave a troll alone enough and they will eventually devastate the environment, eating and wiping out all wildlife."

Due to their large size and regenerative abilities trolls have no natural threat in the wild they are apex predators. Leave a troll alone enough and they will eventually devastate the environment, eating and wiping out all wildlife.\n\nIt seems that the trolls of [From.GetName] have been victims of such a case, and have moved their sights to [Root.GetName]."

  aw_trolls.22.d:0 "Trolls are largely not territorial, except with their own kind. When food runs out, a troll usually migrates to lands fresh with wildlife, but sometimes they will conflict with each other - seeing each other as rivals for food rather than a singular pack, after all, why bother moving if you can just reduce the amount of mouths to feed?"

  aw_trolls.23.d:0 "While trolls are no doubt sentient beasts, they are often dim-witted and easily tricked. Perhaps it is due their 'so-called' alien morality, or perhaps their role as near-unkillable beasts meant they never really had to worry about being smart. Regardless of this, the adventurers tasked with slaying the troll menace in [Root.GetName] has reported good progress, with several trolls being slain."

  aw_trolls.25.d:0 "Trolls are brutal foes. Their regenerating flesh means that even the most savage strike from an axe will be forgotten in a few minutes. Indeed, they are relentless foes, and a true definition of monster. They charge without abandon or fear for their life, and their sharp claws grasp for anything nearby to rend as they do so. Despite this, our brave warriors have managed to strike them down in combat."

  aw_trolls.30.t:0 "Troll Pack Grows"
  aw_trolls.30.d:0 "Most trolls live in small familial packs ranging from 3-12 and are semi-nomadic in nature, living the lifestyle of travelling hunters. With their consistent devastation of the province they have managed to grow in numbers, no doubt threathening more of the land with their dark deeds."

  aw_trolls.40.d:0 "It is true that trolls do not seek violence for violence's sake. They seek it as a means to an end: to eat. They indeed do have redeeming qualities. Their so-called 'alien morality' is odd, sure, for they fail to grasp social conventions and contexts, but that comes with a sort of child-like innocence capable of the greatest thing: trust.\n\nSuch a day has occured, hearing of our tolerant outlook to their kind, the trolls once plaguing [Root.GetName] no longer wish to hunt wildlife in the far reaches of the land, and instead join their brothers and sisters and live amongst our people, as bridgebuilders and keepers, as hunters and guides and people in their own right."

  aw_trolls.140.d:0 "Trolls are certainly strange. They have a sort of child-like innocence to them, if you catch them on a good day. One such troll has taken it to themselves to maintain an important bridge in [Root.GetName], in return for modest amounts of coin, food or trinkets - certainly a better deal than our usual builders! Apparently this phenomenon is quite common for trolls who live closer to settlements, and that it is due to some innate calling to their origins as servants of True Giants that they have a strange affinity with stone and maintaing such structures."

What's worse is that trolls have now moved preying upon farmers working their fields, ruining harvests that would have prevented such a disaster."

It protects the province from attacks from would-be conquerers, and it allows the local garrison to project influence on those beneath its gaze.
