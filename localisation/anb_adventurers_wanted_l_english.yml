Particularly favoring fresh corpses, they are attracted to wherever newly-dug graves can be found and desecrated - battlefields, cemeteries, crypts, and plague-ridden regions. The extensive devastation that has struck [root.getname] has provided the ideal conditions for ghouls to hunt, and they have begun to appear in the region in significant numbers."

  aw_ghouls.22.d:0 "Though their numbers can increase exponentially when dead bodies are plentiful, ghouls require the flesh of the deceased to sustain their bodies, and will begin to break down if they have not been able to feed in more than a fortnight. Either due to overconsumption or proper disposal, the lack of readily available corpses in [root.getname] has deprived the creatures of their food, and they are far less numerous than they used to be. Many have starved, their desiccated corpses found by patrols, while others have left the region for better hunting grounds."

Known colloquially as Ghoul Fever, those afflicted by the condition become intensely feverish a few hours after infection. This fever is followed by hallucinations, rapid weight loss, and intense hunger, with the subject attempting to sate the burning pain in their stomach with whatever is at hand. Lethal in 90% of cases, patients typically perish within 24 hours of symptom onset before resurrecting the following midnight as a ghoul. Outside of the bite itself, ghoul saliva appears to remain a potent disease vector for up to four hours after drying, which may account for so-called "Ghoul Fever Epidemics" that have been noted to occur in certain circumstances'\n\n- On Afflictions Supernatural, Dr. Reginald síl Vekt, 1876"

  aw_ghouls.110.d:0 "Even more so than graveyards, a battlefield is the perfect hunting ground for ghouls. The myriad bodies of the dead and dying left in the wake of clashes between armies are rarely disposed of properly, and provide an ample food source for the monsters. The recent battle fought in [root.getname] has provided one such opportunity for ghouls to gorge themselves on freshly dead flesh, and they now swarm the countryside near the sight of the battle."
  aw_ghouls.200.t:0 "Ghouls Desecrate Graves"
  aw_ghouls.200.d:0 "Though they prefer the flesh of the newly-dead, ghouls are not particularly picky about the bodies they consume. Upon gaining access to a crypt or mausoleum, they will break open every sepulchure and unearth every grave to consume the flesh and gnaw the bones of the dead, moving on once there is no more food for them. Even after the creatures are gone, the damage they have done remains, and many in [root.getname] are furious or traumatized by the desecration of their ancestor's tombs.

  aw_ghouls.201.d:0 "Though they prefer the flesh of the dead, ghouls will pursue living prey and make corpses of them when there are no readily available sources of bodies. Ghouls that find themselves in regions without easy prey often form into packs of 5-8 and roam dark streets and secluded trails at night, attacking travellers or isolated hamlets and consuming the victims. A string of such attacks has recently occurred in [root.getname], demonstrating that the ghoul problem there has not yet burned itself out."

  aw_ghouls.202.d:0 "While ghouls have traditionally lurked in caves, deep forests, or underground tombs, major cities provide another habitat that they are well suited for - the sewers. A rash of ghoul attacks in proximity to several sewer entrances, as well as the disappearance of ratcatchers and other workers sent to investigate, indicates a large ghoul presence in the sewer system, as do the body part that can be found clogging sewer drains throughout the city. If the sewers aren't cleared of ghouls and corpses soon, the unsanitary conditions they are causing could escalate into a major disease outbreak."

Roaming freely and feasting on the half-eaten corpses, a Corpsefield is a place anathema to mortals, more a realm of the dead than the living, where predatory monsters and disease abound. The long-unresolved ghoul issue in our nation has manifested in the presence of many such locations scattered around our realm, their presence confirmed by adventurous scouts. Dread fills the hearts of folk everywhere as news spreads, and travel has ground to a near stop in many places as folk hunker down and desperately hope to avoid the notice of the ghoul menace."

  aw_ghouls.204.t:0 "A Ghastly Stench"
  aw_ghouls.204.d:0 "While ghouls are regarded as sentient undead, they are largely driven by their bestial needs for flesh, making them even more terrifying. A ghoul that is exposed to powerful magics, however, will transform into a far more dangerous creature - a Ghast. With strength and cunning far beyond those of a normal ghoul, Ghasts lead large packs of ghouls on raids against the living and delight in the destruction they cause. Notable for their horrific stench, the smell of rot and fermentation wafts around a ghast at all times, strong enough to make hardy warriors retch. Word has filtered back to the capital of one such creature being sighted in [root.getname], leading packs of dozens of ghouls and leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.""

  aw_ghouls.205.d:0 "Though they prefer the flesh of the newly-dead, ghouls are not particularly picky about the bodies they consume. Upon gaining access to a crypt or mausoleum, they will break open every sepulchure and unearth every grave to consume the flesh and gnaw the bones of the dead, moving on once there is no more food for them. The desecration of tombs in [root.getname] by the ghouls that infest the region has drawn the ire of the priesthood, who demand that we do more to protect the resting places of the dead.
