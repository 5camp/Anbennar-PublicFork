    flavor_freemarches.5.d:1 "The morning was bright and fresh as a band of Freemarcher settlers stepped out of the darkness of the forest into a clearing. When they were not 300 yards from the tree line they saw their first glint of purple and silver as an Amethyst Knight cavalry formation came over the rise, lances lowered.\nThe call went out, 'Back to the trees!', but it was too late. The riders were upon them in a moment, lances whirling, blood splashing on their bright purple cloaks. Of the settlers, only a small fraction managed to make it back to the relative safety of the forest.\n\nTwo young half-orcs had managed to pull one of the riders from their mount and dragged him into the forest as captive. 'We defended the sacred river from all in this forest.' the young ruinborn managed to say, 'From all who would defile it.'. Over the following days he gave much useful information to the Freemarchers. When his usefulness was exhausted, there only remained the question of what to do with him."
