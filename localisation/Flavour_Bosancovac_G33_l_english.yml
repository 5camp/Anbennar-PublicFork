  bosancovac_reconciliation_title:0 "Reconciliation"
  bosancovac_reconciliation_desc:0 "The Grebniesth gardens have always been a good place to conduct diplomacy, perhaps if we bring along emissaries from Amacimst and Malacnar we can work out our differences."

  bosancovac_subdue_the_rabblerousers_title:0 "Subdue the Rabble-Rousers"
  bosancovac_subdue_the_rabblerousers_desc:0 "The troublemakers in Bostynn have been raising havoc for too long. We need to send over peacekeepers from the city guard to handle it."

  bosancovac_repatriate_the_tromseloc_way_title:0 "Repatriate the Tromseloc Way"
  bosancovac_repatriate_the_tromseloc_way_desc:0 "When the Ynnic Empire collapsed, the Tromseloc way fell to Veykodan raids and wendigo attacks with most of the population fleeing to Bosancovac. With support from the city guard, we have the resources to patrol it again and many want to return to their ancestral home."

  bosancovac_reimagining_the_dams_title:0 "Reimagining the Dams"
  bosancovac_reimagining_the_dams_desc:0 "The ynnic dams are architectural marvels and are a source of stability throughout the Ynn. They are majestic, but surely they can be improved. With help from local artists, we can envision what they could be like given proper funding and foresight."

  bosancovac_just_doing_business_title:0 "Just Doing Business"
  bosancovac_just_doing_business_desc:0 "The newcomers to the Ynn, Cannorians, have a different look on life and how they do business. To them having a silver tongue is just as good as silver itself. We can use this new strategy on our subjects to help improve their lands for little investment ourselves."

  bosancovac_a_gemstone_currency_title:0 "A Gemstone Currency"
  bosancovac_a_gemstone_currency_desc:0 "Vels Domfan has a monopoly on our currency, being the holder of the mint. Moving the mint to Bosancovac could prove disastrous, so an alternative currency would be preferable. New gemstones coming from Argezvale seem to be a viable alternative, must notably their rubies."

  bosancovac_technological_showcase_title:0 "Technological Showcase"
  bosancovac_technological_showcase_desc:0 "With our growing progress in technology, we should make a show of it to the Cannorians. Though perhaps with a small incentive for them to show up."

  bosancovac_a_noble_rivalry_desc:0 "The noble realms of Amacimst and Malacnar are each known for their prowess in battle as well as their rivalry with each other. We can exploit this to our advantage if we were to fan the flames of their rivalry until it reached a boiling point. We shall show our intent of joining their rivalry in the hopes that one will seek to overthrow the other."
