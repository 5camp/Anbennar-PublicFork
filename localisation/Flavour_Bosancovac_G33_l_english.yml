  bosancovac_reconciliation_title:0 "Reconciliation"
  bosancovac_reconciliation_desc:0 "The Grebniesth gardens have always been a good place to conduct diplomacy, perhaps if we bring along emissaries from Amacimst and Malacnar we can work out our differences."

  bosancovac_subdue_the_rabblerousers_title:0 "Subdue the Rabble-Rousers"
  bosancovac_subdue_the_rabblerousers_desc:0 "The troublemakers in Bostynn have been raising havoc for too long. We need to send over peacekeepers from the city guard to handle it."

  bosancovac_repatriate_the_tromseloc_way_desc:0 "When the Ynnic Empire collapsed, the Tromseloc way fell to Veykodan raids and wendigo attacks with most of the population fleeing to Bosancovac.

  bosancovac_reimagining_the_dams_title:0 "Reimagining the Dams"
  bosancovac_reimagining_the_dams_desc:0 "The ynnic dams are architectural marvels and are a source of stability throughout the Ynn. They are majestic, but surely they can be improved. With help from local artists, we can envision what they could be like given proper funding and foresight."

  bosancovac_just_doing_business_title:0 "Just Doing Business"
  bosancovac_just_doing_business_desc:0 "The newcomers to the Ynn, Cannorians, have a different look on life and how they do business. To them having a silver tongue is just as good as silver itself. We can use this new strategy on our subjects to help improve their lands for little investment ourselves."

  bosancovac_a_gemstone_currency_title:0 "A Gemstone Currency"
  bosancovac_a_gemstone_currency_desc:0 "Vels Domfan has a monopoly on our currency, being the holder of the mint.

  bosancovac_technological_showcase_title:0 "Technological Showcase"
  bosancovac_technological_showcase_desc:0 "With our growing progress in technology, we should make a show of it to the Cannorians. Though perhaps with a small incentive for them to show up."

  bosancovac_a_noble_rivalry_desc:0 "The noble realms of Amacimst and Malacnar are each known for their prowess in battle as well as their rivalry with each other.

  bosancovac_finding_a_niche_title:0 "Finding a Niche"
  bosancovac_finding_a_niche_desc:0 "With the growing production of rope and oil for lanterns, it seems these new goods have a large demand from the newcomers in the Ynn.

  bosancovac_improved_metallurgy_title:0 "Improved Metallurgy"
  bosancovac_improved_metallurgy_desc:0 "Clockwork is not new to the ynn, though it's so far been limited to small trinkets. A promising scientist in Bosancovac has learned of a new technique to create better springs that could be used for larger scale projects."

  bosancovac_standard_time_clock_terminal_title:0 "Standard Time Clock Terminal"
  bosancovac_standard_time_clock_terminal_desc:0 "Watermills have long been a feature seen on the Ynn's riverside. However with our advancements in clockwork, improvements could be made to them to incorporate clockwork into their designs. Also with the increased prevalence of clocks, a central clocktower should be build in Bosancovac to accurately coordinate the clocks throughout the Ynn."

  bosancovac_clockwork_city_title:0 "Clockwork City"
  bosancovac_clockwork_city_desc:0 "With the expansion of clockwork across the Ynn, it has come time for Bosancovac to upgrade the floating city."

  #Col 3

  bosancovac_secure_more_materials_title:0 "Secure More Materials"
  bosancovac_secure_more_materials_desc:0 "Bosancovac is growing, too much in fact. The foundations are old and in need of repair, and besides that room in the city is running low. To expand our foundations, we must secure more lumber and look to the architects hosted in Brelar for their expertise."

  bosancovac_the_gem_of_dolindha_title:0 "The Gem of Dolindha"
  bosancovac_the_gem_of_dolindha_desc:0 "Bosancovac is primed to become the most important city in Dolindha. Already having passed the old Ynnic Capital of Vareynn, a growing population and more trade flowing through the city will raise Bosancovac past the likes of Malacnar and Amacimst."

  bosancovac_expand_the_merchant_fleet_title:0 "Expand the Merchant Fleet"
  bosancovac_expand_the_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "As our presence atop the Ynn increases, so too does our reliance on lumber to create more vessels. The nearby forest in Drevonsred is the key to furthering our ambitions."

  bosancovac_sway_their_clergy_title:0 "Sway Their Clergy"
  bosancovac_sway_their_clergy_desc:0 "The lords of the Arganynn and Ancovynn are compliant, yet still scheme amongst themselves. With a sizeable donation, we can convince their devout that we are the true rulers of the Ynn, and their lords should be put in line."

  bosancovac_rise_of_the_patricians_desc:0 "The influence of the patricians of Bosancovac is growing. With the increase of trade and manufacturing, the most prominent families have grown wealthy enough to overshadow all the smaller ones and yet seek to grow their power further. "

  bosancovac_formalize_succession_title:0 "Formalize Succession"
  bosancovac_formalize_succession_desc:0 "Choosing the successor to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has always been an informal affair, either the ruling [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] picks someone or the other priests put forth someone to the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. With a patrician's child as current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] however, it is time to formalize how the succession works. By establishing rules and processes that favor the patricians, they effectively can choose who becomes the next [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

  bosancovac_centralize_the_temples_title:0 "Centralize the Temples"
  bosancovac_centralize_the_temples_desc:0 "The other temples of the Ynn, Svemel and Adbrabohvi, have ruled separately from us for too long. Now that we are the leader of the Ynn, spiritually, economically, and politically, the temples of the ynn should be more directly under our control."

  bosancovac_downriver_relations_desc:0 "Keeping good relations with the lord of Vels Bacar is important to be able to conduct trade and ferry the toll payments made for monarchs passing through the dams.

  bosancovac_support_the_merchant_fleet_title:0 "Support the Merchant Fleet"
  bosancovac_support_the_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "Our Holy Merchant Fleet is what most people of the Ynn know us for. Bolstering it to allow for more trade would benefit us greatly.

  bosancovac_establish_trading_ports_title:0 "Establish Trading Ports"
  bosancovac_establish_trading_ports_desc:0 "Establishing our holy ports along the Ynn is beneficial to all, though us most of all. By creating a network of ports, trade throughout the Ynn will increase with less restrictions."

  bosancovac_influence_of_the_confluence_title:0 "Influence of the Confluence"
  bosancovac_influence_of_the_confluence_desc:0 "With all the lords between Vels Bacar and Mocbarja as our Iosahar, we can exert our influence to let the flow of goods run free through our ports."

  bosancovac_revitalized_administration_title:0 "Revitalized Administration"
  bosancovac_revitalized_administration_desc:0 "With so many Iosahar now, we must rethink our governing and create a new structure to adequately rule over the Ynn."

  bosancovac_hostile_takeover_title:0 "Hostile Takeover"
  bosancovac_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "Controlling all of Dolindha is a great opportunity to expand our trade. Instead of leasing out a port for a few years, we can have the holy ports become permanent fixtures along the Ynn, districts that can support more trade than ever."

  bosancovac_remove_the_false_belief_title:0 "Remove the False Belief"
  bosancovac_remove_the_false_belief_desc:0 "By killing the dragon Varlengeilt, we can turn the Rzentur people back to worshipping the Ynn. Also by doing this, we can expand our markets into Rzenta and hold great sway in those lands through their clergy."

  bosancovac_upriver_exercises_desc:0 "With assistance from a riverblade instructor, we are attempting to train our hired Paddleboard Knights with our standing army in order to more closely integrate them. In an attempt to test our neighbor's border, we have been doing these exercises on the outskirts of Malivab while the Amacimst army is busy elsewhere."

  bosancovac_knights_aboard_title:0 "Knights Aboard"
  bosancovac_knights_aboard_desc:0 "The Paddleboard Knights are now trained to work in tandem with our army. If we built larger vessels, we could transport our troops along the Ynn and allow them to strike anywhere along the riverside."

  bosancovac_create_a_path_to_the_source_desc:0 "The revelation of finding the source of the Ynn sent ripples throughout Bosancovac with many wanting us to secure a route there in order to make pilgrimages. While securing a foothold in the Forest of the Cursed Ones will be difficult, there have been disturbances in the forest so someone else may have already gotten started."

  bosancovac_secure_the_lake_title:0 "Secure the Lake"
  bosancovac_secure_the_lake_desc:0 "We have made our way back to the source, though in order for pilgrims to have a calm peace of mind we will need to figure out a way to prevent attacks on our base there."

  bosancovac_establish_holy_site_title:0 "Establish Holy Site"
  bosancovac_establish_holy_site_desc:0 "With a secure route established, now all that needs to be done is to create some infrastructure along the way for pilgrims to stop at. The fork in the river would make for an excellent place to build up the most as it's halfway point and has good connections via the rivers. \n\nThe holy site will feature an area where pilgrims can enter the source and be cleansed by a priest overseeing the ceremony. Along with this, there will be a great temple overlooking the water with an attached stable for pilgrims to make a trip around the source atop an antler horse. Of course, for these services the church must collect a tithe from the devout making the trip."
