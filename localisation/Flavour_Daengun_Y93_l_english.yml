 desc_daengun_isolation_disaster:0 "As King Jeong-Hun reaches his final days, now too ill to even give orders, the peace he built in Daengun finds itself under threat. The struggles of the court factions have reached a peak and the kingdom's administration is paralyzed, as competing factions dispatch conflicting orders and many bureaucrats simply refuse to do anything not previously authorized by Jeong-Hun himself. The Kingdom is in its most precarious position yet and if not handled properly, Odheongu may still return to the civil wars of the Sewengun Period."
