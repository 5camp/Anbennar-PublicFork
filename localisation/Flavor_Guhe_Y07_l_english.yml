 guhe_centralized_defense_title:0 "A Centralized Defense"
 guhe_centralized_defense_desc:0 "The League is on the verge of collapse, even if few will openly say it. Years of complacency left our alliance utterly incapable of facing the growing threat to our north, and the loss at Yaocing is a testament to that. As the great river is reddened by Yanszin's blood, growing threats find themselves ever more emboldened by the opportunity to pounce. \n\nA new strategy must be adopted - one where the League needs not rely on the neglected and ill-managed armies of our sister-states but rather on a strong, centralized military with Guhe at its head."

 guhe_strategic_ed_title:0 "Strategic Education"
 guhe_strategic_ed_desc:0 "Even as the League falls ever closer to peril, the great school of Yangcheng is ever hesitant to commit to decisive action. Even now, as threats loom from all directions, they prioritize studying old tomes and petty politics. \nOur place as the de facto military of the League has gained us a certain degree of influence over our sister cities - particularly Yangcheng, who has always been a weak link in our armed forces. With a small application of pressure, we may be able to secure a greater education for our growing officer corps."

 guhe_yanzhong_aid_title:0 "Demand Yanzhong Aid"
 guhe_yanzhong_aid_desc:0 "Of all our allies, Yanzhong has been the most tiresome to deal with in matters of our new military. Citing hyperbolic issues of manpower, the centralized Yanszin forces are repeatedly called on by the trade city to solve matters beneath even a common guardsman. \nIf they wish to lean on our military to this extreme, we must ensure that they will pay proportionately.
