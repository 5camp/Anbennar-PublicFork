 marble_harvesting_finest_marble_desc:0 "We, the working and sweating dwarves of the mountains of Serpentreach pride ourselves in our grit and hardiness. While we may be short and rigid, we are tough and resilient. Hence, we dutifully work hard for our pay, be it from trade or from barter. As such, we have been granted an opportunity from our ancestors a grand trade for a simple stone. The low-lying peoples of Bulwar seek our marble, as their grand palaces and structures require the resources of many lands - which includes ours. These elves, humans, whoever may it be, are very resourceful people. They understand the true gift of our hold, hence we must honor their wishes through the promise of marble."

 marble_legacy_of_marble_desc:0 "The process of making marble from a beautiful piece of natural rock to a beautiful piece of artwork to line the halls of courts and palaces across the world is long and hard. Starting from the quarries in the Marble Galleries, Shazstundihr, and across lesser quarries in and around the Serpentreach and Bulwar, the stone is harvested in big chunks, cut down to size, and brought down hundreds of miles from mountains to cities. In these cities, the marble is sold in various different forms: from slabs to small cuts and even full sized chunks for those who use it for large construction. Across the world, the marble harvested from any other mines pales in comparison to the ones harvested in the areas around Shazstundihr. Purely white marble, easy to carve, and easy to mine and deliver. Desired by many, controlled by us. We control the marble trade, a true monopoly on an expensive good.\n\nShazstundihri marble can be found everywhere now, for cheap and for plenty. When one now visits a town in the Harpy Hills, or Brasan and Bulwar even, they will not see the weak and ugly stone of before, they will see the strong marble lining the city with art carved into it with care.\n\nThe legacy of marble has become legendary. One may even say it has become more desired than diamonds, mithril, and damestear. The greatest of sculptures and most astounding buildings seem to all now be credited to Shazstundihri marble. We shouldn’t just sell our marble, but celebrate it for what good fortune it has brought us."

If we, the working, sweating Dwarven men of Shazstundihr promise peace, bread, and trade with all who gaze upon our gates, why is it that these wretched dirthobbit scoundrel ravage and barbarize our work? It was once said that only a being with the capability to think can differentiate a stone from a gem. If true, then the goblins only think of our marvelous work as nothing short of a trove of loot, for them alone and for no one else's. This grave insult to our ancestors, to our very own livelihood, This cannot go on for long.

The fort is white and constructed of marble, with clear resemblance to early Shazstundihri architecture. It was also recently discovered through excavation around the area, that the designer of the fort was fond of our ancestors' architecture, and had visited Shazstundihr many times before when our gates remained open. \n\nIt is our job to bring the fort’s full potential out, and to make it shine once more. If we don’t, how can we call ourselves the best builders around? Let us begin the redesigning!"

As such, it was used by the goblins as a passage into the outside world. If we are to protect our new home from future invasions, we must reach Bulwar – and rid it of such squatters.\n\nWhile we are used to preparing and carrying out expeditions into hostile lands, this one will require much more effort from our part: we must seek to befriend whatever men live there, and we ought to be ready for their response."

That did not stop, however, the first foreign delegation to cross the Marble Gate in centuries from gazing in awe at our ongoing works. Halls, tunnels and bridges all clad in white, pink and black tones of our namesake stone, all seemed to greatly relieve the guests as they entered.\n\n“We came to these halls dreading darkness”, one of the diplomats remarked, “it was not our expectation to find a place so fresh and enlightened”. So it happens that part of this hold is within the sunlight’s grasp due to marble’s reflective nature – allowing the creation of a small diplomatic facility for our light-accustomed friends.\n\nA new diplomatic facility will solidify our alliance, in addition to securing guidance for further expeditions into the lands bathed by the Sun."

If we don’t want to collapse on our own weight, then reform is a necessity. But, where to start? Thanks to our scholars, we have an idea.\n\nWhile most records of old Shazstundihr have long been destroyed, we were able to recover a small few which gave us insight on how the hold operated. One institution that came up multiple times is the ‘White Stone Council’, a chamber of government that only allowed the most skilled citizens within the hold’s domain to participate within it, where they advised the monarch in all things that fell under their field of expertise. Not long after this revelation, there has been a vast amount of support from our officials for restoring the Council, and the King has little reason to disagree."

Modern interactions have also tended toward hostility, with the new elven Sun Cult proclaiming the elves as the divine living scions of the one true god, holding dominion and stewardship over the whole of the world.\n\nBut the Elves of Bulwar today are not the lords of the Phoenix Empire of centuries past, and this New Sun Cult is scarcely a generation old to most Elves. Both our peoples have been humbled by internal strife and the ravages of time. It is as strangers to this land that we come to Bulwar, and it is time to put the old enmities to rest. We can make inroads, plan economic and administrative systems to benefit both our peoples, and forge a new future where strife can be settled with negotiation rather than force of arms."

In modern times, all that was built 3000 years ago has now been built over by the Bulwari, with inspiration from the Shazstundihri shown throughout.

Statues, buildings, and monuments are visible in every part of the country to represent not just the Shazstundihri, but all that live inside it. People are free to practice and express themselves in any way they want. From humans, to elves, to dwarves and even harpies, they no longer have to fight pointless wars based on prejudice and race.\n\nThere is now Peace In Our Time, and Bulwar now knows how good it can be to unite together as brethren. While some still look on with disgust and hatred, they see soon enough that as servants of liberty and equality, the Kingdom Of Marble will stand steadfast against all opposition."

But our awe soon turned to sorrow, and then to rage as we realized we are still merely seeing the husk of a once great society, one whose great white walls still failed to save it from the hordes of wretched Goblins who couldn’t perceive the splendor they destroyed. Ages of greatness, lost forever, like the last copy of a prized storybook thrown into a fireplace, burnt to cinders…\n\n…But, unlike there, Shazstundihr’s story doesn’t have to end. Even if what has been lost can never be recreated, we will create new works to replace the old. A new chapter for the story of our hold, a new slate, a new beginning!

Regardless, if we want to take the Serpentreach back for all Dwarvenkind, we cannot allow this to divide us!

Far, far older. Though the winds may surge and twist and howl, they will never batter down the mountains that stand unflinching and motionless. It is in pursuit of our ageless traditions that we have sought to restore Shazstundihr and unite the peoples of Bulwar, and it is to this Dwarven obstinancy that we appealed to in order to counter the Harpies' argument for tradition. The mountains have come, and the Harpies may join our people in prosperity. If other Bulwari nations had conquered them first, the Harpies would undoubtedly face enslavement or extinction, and our offer is exceedingly reasonable in comparison.\n\nMany Harpy Matriarchs were not convinced of our sincerity or would not abandon ideas of a Bulwar dominated by Harpies, but some saw the appeal of Shazstundihr's vision. Over months, word of the talks became common knowledge among the Harpy population, and conflict sparked between the traditionalists and those who would make common cause with us. The Matriarchs, fearing that they will lose control as more and more Harpies answer our call, now plan open rebellion to regain their independence and dislodge the influence of Shazstundihr.
