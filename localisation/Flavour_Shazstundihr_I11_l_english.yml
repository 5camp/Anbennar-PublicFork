 marble_harvesting_finest_marble_desc:0 "We, the working and sweating dwarves of the mountains of Serpentreach pride ourselves in our grit and hardiness. While we may be short and rigid, we are tough and resilient. Hence, we dutifully work hard for our pay, be it from trade or from barter. As such, we have been granted an opportunity from our ancestors a grand trade for a simple stone. The low-lying peoples of Bulwar seek our marble, as their grand palaces and structures require the resources of many lands - which includes ours. These elves, humans, whoever may it be, are very resourceful people. They understand the true gift of our hold, hence we must honor their wishes through the promise of marble."

 marble_the_food_basket_desc:0 "With expansion always comes the problem of logistics. We have set our sights on bringing our prosperity to the rest of Bulwar, and for that we need to have the infrastructure to handle a larger population and and army. Ensuring we can provide food for the hungry will require significant investment from the council, because while this isn't the flashy side of expansion, it is needed."

 marble_preparation_for_expedition_title:0 "Preparations For The Expedition"
 marble_preparation_for_expedition_desc:0 "Shazstundihr sits at the southern heights of the Serpentreach, having served as a point of entrance to Bulwar until its fall. As such, it was used by the goblins as a passage into the outside world. If we are to protect our new home from future invasions, we must reach Bulwar – and rid it of such squatters.\n\nWhile we are used to preparing and carrying out expeditions into hostile lands, this one will require much more effort from our part: we must seek to befriend whatever men live there, and we ought to be ready for their response."
 marble_a_guide_into_light_title:0 "A Guide Into The Light"
 marble_a_guide_into_light_desc:0 "We are still a long way to restoring the splendor Shazstundihr had before its fall. That did not stop, however, the first foreign delegation to cross the Marble Gate in centuries from gazing in awe at our ongoing works. Halls, tunnels and bridges all clad in white, pink and black tones of our namesake stone, all seemed to greatly relieve the guests as they entered.\n\n“We came to these halls dreading darkness”, one of the diplomats remarked, “it was not our expectation to find a place so fresh and enlightened”. So it happens that part of this hold is within the sunlight’s grasp due to marble’s reflective nature – allowing the creation of a small diplomatic facility for our light-accustomed friends.\n\nA new diplomatic facility will solidify our alliance, in addition to securing guidance for further expeditions into the lands bathed by the Sun."
 marble_reforging_the_council_title:0 "Reforging The Council"
 marble_reforging_the_council_desc:0 "As we continue to expand and develop, it’s becoming apparent our current methods of governance won’t suffice. Already our departments are reaching their very limits while bloat prevents the truly talented from rising above the filth that has begun to fester. If we don’t want to collapse on our own weight, then reform is a necessity. But, where to start? Thanks to our scholars, we have an idea.\n\nWhile most records of old Shazstundihr have long been destroyed, we were able to recover a small few which gave us insight on how the hold operated. One institution that came up multiple times is the ‘White Stone Council’, a chamber of government that only allowed the most skilled citizens within the hold’s domain to participate within it, where they advised the monarch in all things that fell under their field of expertise. Not long after this revelation, there has been a vast amount of support from our officials for restoring the Council, and the King has little reason to disagree."

 marble_integrating_elves_title:0 "Integrating The Elves"
 marble_integrating_elves_desc:0 "Relations between the Dwarves and Elves have long been fraught, dating back millennia to a primordial conflict between our Ancestors and the Precursors of the Elves. Modern interactions have also tended toward hostility, with the new elven Sun Cult proclaiming the elves as the divine living scions of the one true god, holding dominion and stewardship over the whole of the world.\n\nBut the Elves of Bulwar today are not the lords of the Phoenix Empire of centuries past, and this New Sun Cult is scarcely a generation old to most Elves. Both our peoples have been humbled by internal strife and the ravages of time. It is as strangers to this land that we come to Bulwar, and it is time to put the old enmities to rest. We can make inroads, plan economic and administrative systems to benefit both our peoples, and forge a new future where strife can be settled with negotiation rather than force of arms."
 marble_simbur_plan_title:0 "Simbûr's Plan"
 marble_simbur_plan_desc:0 "How does one unite polar opposites?\n\nAn feat unthought of, similar to trying to connect like sides of two large magnets: the closer they get, the harder they push back. Although, just because something looks hard, doesn't mean it can't be done.\n\nSimbur, who has proven himself an advocate for peace and unity, has come to the council with his latest plan to build a bridge between the New Sun Cult and the Old Sun Cult, in an attempt to lessen the stigmas that have risen from this eternal conflict between them. We will require a large amount of support though, especially from the New Sun Cult, who are unrelenting in their beliefs of elven superiority, before we can continue forward with our mission."
 marble_appeasing_opposers_title:0 "Appeasing The Opposers"
 marble_appeasing_opposers_desc:0 "There are many who doubt our intentions, they say we are conquerors ruling for wealth, they say we desecrate their faith and spit on their traditions. We must show them they are wrong. We will be better than their rulers once were, we must be in order to secure peace. By the will of Simbur there will be a reckoning in these lands, a reckoning against injustice, against poverty, and against suffering. That will prove them all wrong."

 marble_a_new_slate_title:0 "A New Slate"
 marble_a_new_slate_desc:0 "When we first set foot in the White City, our breaths were taken away as we gazed upon the hold. Even ruined, it held great splendor. But our awe soon turned to sorrow, and then to rage as we realized we are still merely seeing the husk of a once great society, one whose great white walls still failed to save it from the hordes of wretched Goblins who couldn’t perceive the splendor they destroyed. Ages of greatness, lost forever, like the last copy of a prized storybook thrown into a fireplace, burnt to cinders…\n\n…But, unlike there, Shazstundihr’s story doesn’t have to end. Even if what has been lost can never be recreated, we will create new works to replace the old. A new chapter for the story of our hold, a new slate, a new beginning! And this time, we will not fall again!"
 marble_pave_the_way_title:0 "Pave The Way"
 marble_pave_the_way_desc:0 "Upon our arrival to our hold, we learned not long after of the existence of a neighboring one. Arg-Ôrdstun, home to the Diamond Dwarves and once rival to the capital itself. They have a proud history, yet that history has made them arrogant, even in the face of near extinction at the hands of the Goblins! Regardless, if we want to take the Serpentreach back for all Dwarvenkind, we cannot allow this to divide us! For us to truly prosper we must join one another as brothers and unite against the evils that seek to undo us. If they cannot see that…\n\nthen the sword will succeed where the quill has failed."
