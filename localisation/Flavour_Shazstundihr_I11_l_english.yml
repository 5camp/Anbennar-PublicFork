 marble_harvesting_finest_marble_desc:0 "We, the working and sweating dwarves of the mountains of Serpentreach pride ourselves in our grit and hardiness. While we may be short and rigid, we are tough and resilient. Hence, we dutifully work hard for our pay, be it from trade or from barter. As such, we have been granted an opportunity from our ancestors a grand trade for a simple stone. The low-lying peoples of Bulwar seek our marble, as their grand palaces and structures require the resources of many lands - which includes ours. These elves, humans, whoever may it be, are very resourceful people. They understand the true gift of our hold, hence we must honor their wishes through the promise of marble."

 marble_legacy_of_marble_desc:0 "The process of making marble from a beautiful piece of natural rock to a beautiful piece of artwork to line the halls of courts and palaces across the world is long and hard. Starting from the quarries in the Marble Galleries, Shazstundihr, and across lesser quarries in and around the Serpentreach and Bulwar, the stone is harvested in big chunks, cut down to size, and brought down hundreds of miles from mountains to cities. In these cities, the marble is sold in various different forms: from slabs to small cuts and even full sized chunks for those who use it for large construction. Across the world, the marble harvested from any other mines pales in comparison to the ones harvested in the areas around Shazstundihr. Purely white marble, easy to carve, and easy to mine and deliver. Desired by many, controlled by us. We control the marble trade, a true monopoly on an expensive good.\n\nShazstundihri marble can be found everywhere now, for cheap and for plenty. When one now visits a town in the Harpy Hills, or Brasan and Bulwar even, they will not see the weak and ugly stone of before, they will see the strong marble lining the city with art carved into it with care.\n\nThe legacy of marble has become legendary. One may even say it has become more desired than diamonds, mithril, and damestear. The greatest of sculptures and most astounding buildings seem to all now be credited to Shazstundihri marble. We shouldn’t just sell our marble, but celebrate it for what good fortune it has brought us."

It was once said that only a being with the capability to think can differentiate a stone from a gem. If true, then the goblins only think of our marvelous work as nothing short of a trove of loot, for them alone and for no one else's.

The fort is white and constructed of marble, with clear resemblance to early Shazstundihri architecture. It was also recently discovered through excavation around the area, that the designer of the fort was fond of our ancestors' architecture, and had visited Shazstundihr many times before when our gates remained open. \n\nIt is our job to bring the fort’s full potential out, and to make it shine once more.

If we are to protect our new home from future invasions, we must reach Bulwar – and rid it of such squatters.\n\nWhile we are used to preparing and carrying out expeditions into hostile lands, this one will require much more effort from our part: we must seek to befriend whatever men live there, and we ought to be ready for their response."

Halls, tunnels and bridges all clad in white, pink and black tones of our namesake stone, all seemed to greatly relieve the guests as they entered.\n\n“We came to these halls dreading darkness”, one of the diplomats remarked, “it was not our expectation to find a place so fresh and enlightened”. So it happens that part of this hold is within the sunlight’s grasp due to marble’s reflective nature – allowing the creation of a small diplomatic facility for our light-accustomed friends.\n\nA new diplomatic facility will solidify our alliance, in addition to securing guidance for further expeditions into the lands bathed by the Sun."

If we don’t want to collapse on our own weight, then reform is a necessity. But, where to start? Thanks to our scholars, we have an idea.\n\nWhile most records of old Shazstundihr have long been destroyed, we were able to recover a small few which gave us insight on how the hold operated. One institution that came up multiple times is the ‘White Stone Council’, a chamber of government that only allowed the most skilled citizens within the hold’s domain to participate within it, where they advised the monarch in all things that fell under their field of expertise. Not long after this revelation, there has been a vast amount of support from our officials for restoring the Council, and the King has little reason to disagree."

Both our peoples have been humbled by internal strife and the ravages of time. It is as strangers to this land that we come to Bulwar, and it is time to put the old enmities to rest. We can make inroads, plan economic and administrative systems to benefit both our peoples, and forge a new future where strife can be settled with negotiation rather than force of arms."

In modern times, all that was built 3000 years ago has now been built over by the Bulwari, with inspiration from the Shazstundihri shown throughout.

People are free to practice and express themselves in any way they want. From humans, to elves, to dwarves and even harpies, they no longer have to fight pointless wars based on prejudice and race.\n\nThere is now Peace In Our Time, and Bulwar now knows how good it can be to unite together as brethren.

Ages of greatness, lost forever, like the last copy of a prized storybook thrown into a fireplace, burnt to cinders…\n\n…But, unlike there, Shazstundihr’s story doesn’t have to end.

Far, far older. Though the winds may surge and twist and howl, they will never batter down the mountains that stand unflinching and motionless. It is in pursuit of our ageless traditions that we have sought to restore Shazstundihr and unite the peoples of Bulwar, and it is to this Dwarven obstinancy that we appealed to in order to counter the Harpies' argument for tradition. The mountains have come, and the Harpies may join our people in prosperity. If other Bulwari nations had conquered them first, the Harpies would undoubtedly face enslavement or extinction, and our offer is exceedingly reasonable in comparison.\n\nMany Harpy Matriarchs were not convinced of our sincerity or would not abandon ideas of a Bulwar dominated by Harpies, but some saw the appeal of Shazstundihr's vision. Over months, word of the talks became common knowledge among the Harpy population, and conflict sparked between the traditionalists and those who would make common cause with us. The Matriarchs, fearing that they will lose control as more and more Harpies answer our call, now plan open rebellion to regain their independence and dislodge the influence of Shazstundihr.

Lifts for transportation and mobility, sturdier platforms, and general quality of life improvements. Unfortunately, adding any big projects has been an issue, for it poses risks to our non-harpy stonemasons. Thus, we found a nearby mesa, and established a road network from there to the main city. With enough space to fit one major construction people are vying to compete for who’s idea will be turned into reality. One Harpy General has offered her soldiers and equipment to the country in return for letting her have the land. Another Harpy wants to assist her brethren in integrating into Harpy society via a school of education.

Standing in the middle of the crater, were the risen Vîhtebloth, along with the mages, standing firm. Skin of hardened marble, eyes white as snow. One of the soldiers, walks forward, and declares, “I am Ungrim Gray- No, I am Ungrim Shazstunbloth, and as the leader of the Vihtebloth, we are here to serve Shazstundihr with every fiber in our body.""

Now that it is in our control, we will make sure to take full advantage of this opportunity by once again devoting our resources into making renovations, and a new Marble Building. Locals have petitioned for a renovation of the local city square, so they can have a communal center. This may bring in more travelers and prosperity to the city. Intellectuals have been arguing for renovations to the local university, so that they may be able to expand their studies. Finally, a local general has asked for funding for a new military academy in the region. Our dwarven troops are still learning about the Bulwari tactics and ways of fighting, thus it may be a good idea to invest into the general’s ideas. We once again must choose wisely, for only one shall be built!"

 shaz_events.19.d:0 "Brasan is a historical city of the Bulwari, for it is said that a genie of the same name gave liberation to all humans in its grounds. Now it has become the greatest city across the Divenhal, thanks to our guidance, of course. Our Marble Trade reaches from the edges of Sorncost to the northern edges of the Dameshead, down to the beaches of Kheterata and Sarhal, and then returning to Brasan once more. With this influx of trade going in and out of the city, we find ourselves overwhelmed attempting to keep everything in order. To make sure that we are able to keep up and sustain the trade of Brasan, the White Stone Council has decided to renovate the city to increase its capacity. As the infrastructure is expanded to even greater heights, a plan on how to make sure we can control the reigns of the Divenhal is still being decided. Three plans stand out as unique and most likely to succeed. Two involve rehaulting the port completely, which would take some time, but would end up allowing us to increase our capacity. The traders of our nation are split on whether to dedicate the new areas to be added to the port for ships or for markets. Another proposition has been made by foreign investors to construct an exchange in Brasan, where people would be free to invest their ducats into whatever they felt like, and where they could store their money as well. Brasan could use for all three of these buildings, but local resources are limited and workers are expensive, thus we only have time for one. The course of our trade across the Divenhal may be decided here."

Now, people fight over the beliefs of superiority, and inequality, all pushed forwards due to religion at the forefront. The Sun Cults, now practically at each other’s throats, fight to prove who is right in the name of their god, who even they make conflict over his name. It’s nothing more than a foolish bout. People are free to have discourse and debates, and discuss the nature of their gods, but the violence perpetrated here is something our ancestors have never seen, from Cannor and back into the Serpentreach.\nWhat is the need to fight here? Why can't we just agree to disagree? The people leading these kingdoms sure seem to love to preach the beliefs of elven superiority, and having the blessings of Surael. Maybe it's time for a change of pace, a new era, where the Sun Cults could at the very least, attempt to live in peace. I hope you all will help me on this journey.\n\n-General Simbûr."

 shaz_events.24.d:0 "In ancient times, the Marble Gate served two purposes. First, it would be closed to defend the Dwarves from intruders. Second, its engravings exhibited the artistry of Shazstundihr's stoneworkers, and was emblematic of the marble hold and its trade. But in our time, both of these purposes are lost. After we stepped beyond its threshold and built peace in Bulwar, there are no longer any intruders to repel and many Dwarves spend much time on the surface among our new citizens. When we considered how to restore the Marble Gate, we realized that it must embody a new purpose to reflect the changes we have wrought.\n\nA sea of onlookers watched over many days as the ruin of the gate was methodically repaired, with thick marble plates covering the worn and damaged exterior and the frame itself being entirely replaced. Once complete, the two doors of the gate were closed, and the great work began. The masons began engraving on both sides, but those outside the gates could only see what occurred from their side. Massive linear dwarven runic patterns were engraved on the outside face of the gates. But one day, the Dwarves stopped their carving while the doors overall seemed quite bare, and the onlookers were puzzled at first. Surely the restoration of the Marble Gate could not be completed so quickly and so simply by the skilled Dwarves? These murmurs were silenced when people closer to the gate shouted that they could still hear hammering and chiseling. The work was continuing from the inside.\n\nAfter weeks, the crowd's patience was at last rewarded. Grinding stone reverberated out as the colossal doors slowly opened, and all stood under the bright white shadow of the Marble Gates. The insides of the gate doors had been expertly engraved with scenes from throughout four thousand years of Bulwari history: the genies and the God-kings; the rise of the Sun Cult; the establishment of the Bulwari Accord; the Akalšesi Renaissance, the landing of Jaher; and crowned with the refounding of Shazstundihr. More than just a monument to Shazstundihr or Bulwar, it was clear to all that the Marble Gate glorifies civilization itself, in all its successes and struggles. The future is built over the past, and in Shazstundihr we have erected an eternal marble foundation that all posterity will be constructed on. We looked to those who came before, and now we shall lead and inspire those who come after, with gates perpetually open."

 shaz_events.25.t:0 "Building Bulwar"
 shaz_events.25.d:0 "Bulwar is the most important city in Bulwar, at least, at one point it was. For years now, the city of Bulwar has been under the rule of a small city state, subject to obedience by the gnolls and elves. Before that though, its legacy was great, as the capital for many great empires. They all have left their mark in the cities architecture, with their extravagant art and gilded walls. Much of what they have learned though, originated from our hold, and our famed architects. \n\nNow that the hold is in our hands, it is time for us to leave our mark on the city, and certify to our people that we rule not for conquest, but for all that is serene and harmonious. This building shall come to represent to our people, their kin, and the rest of their descendants, the legacy that our hold left on Bulwar. If we want something big, grandiose, and history making, three things come to mind. The Walls Of Bulwar could represent a legacy of protection, and safety for our people. The Dams of Bulwar could tell a story of agriculture, production, and good harvest. The Palaces of Bulwar could come to show a kingdom of great rulers, and prosperity for our kingdom.\n\nHow can the legacy of a kingdom be decided by buildings? It cannot always be. Some kingdoms' legacies are decided by the blood and battle they have shed. Others have had them decided by the amount of land conquered into their kingdoms. Only a few ever have their kingdoms decided by the peace they bring, and the culture and art that comes from. Fewer have something to show for it, with their era being lost to times of death and war. Shazstundihr though, its buildings shall stand high. This is much bigger than the small buildings we’ve built throughout the lands for harpies, elves, and humans alike. This is us, the people, united under one common banner. We must be wise, and think long and hard, for when the day is over, we begin."

 shaz_events.26.d:0 "This note was found in the Simbur Residence in Aqatbar, which was given to the state per the will of the last surviving member of the family. It was supposed to be given to the King of Shazstundihr, after Simbur’s passing at the age of 397, but was lost between the relocation of their family from Shazstundihr to Bulwar.\n\n“To a dear friend,\n\nI don’t think that I have to be so formal with you. When we first met you were simply a noble, but as we talked, I realized our ideologies, ideas, and will proved to be all too alike. You are an idealist, and that is worth well enough praise on its own. It wasn’t just that though. Thanks to you, we managed to save tens of thousands of people from oppression and gave them a chance at a free life. \n\nWhile I spent my younger days slaughtering hordes of goblins and orcs, I came to learn as I grew ever older that even they are worthy of respect and honor in their own right. Each of these beings had to complete a course of trial and tribulation, and eventually succeeded in their own ways, even if we don’t have the best of relations. By destroying the pseuds who called themselves the “Rightful Owners of Bulwar,” we managed to clear out an illness that had been plaguing the region for so long: oppression through hierarchy.  From my bed I can now see harpies flying above the clouds, dwarves building hundreds of towers, and elves serving alongside humans to protect the city of Aqatbar.\n\nAs I lay in my bed, tired and needing assistance to get around anywhere, I thank you for helping me give others long and fruitful lives, just like mine. You are an inspiration to all, and I am thankful to have served alongside you.\n\nAs my final wish, I grant you my family title, of which you have done nothing but embody and become a true exemplar of. I hope our paths may cross once more in another life."

The Bulwari humans have inhabited the area for eons under different kingdoms, and it represents a center of culture and community for them. Then, the city layed devastated from conflict and the rise of the rivalry between Bizartanseshi and the Dartaxi. Now, Akal Uak has once again risen to become a center of human prosperity thanks to our hand, and many of the Old Sun Cult have returned. The people of Akal Uak have asked for renovations to one of the religious buildings in the city. Unfortunately, the public remains divided on which. One group has been fond of an ancestral temple on the outskirts of the city, which supposedly has ties to many families across Bulwar, and possibly even further. Another group has asked for the temple of Surakel to be refurbished in the city square, so that people may come and pray to their lord as they please without having to deal with rundown infrastructure. Finally, the Magi of the city have asked for the old Magi palace to be renovated, so they may continue their magical studies.

The Gelkali are the dominant peoples in the far east of Bulwar, living off the mountainous terrain with the assistance of the famed Gelkar Goats. Their capital lay in one of these rugged hills, and is an important stop for all who traverse the land. This is why the White Stone Council decided that investment was necessary for continued success in the region. The city was made more accessible by road, and its buildings and monuments refurbished. Finally, to leave our mark in the city, we decided to begin plans on a new building located nearby the city of Gelkalis. We purchased a large plot of land, and began hearing out ideas for what should be placed there. Many of the locals have asked for the lands to become dedicated farmlands, and for the infrastructure around it to be repurposed as barnyards and farms. A dwarven general suggest we take advantage of the position of Gelkalis and to turn the area into a mountain fortress, impenetrable to all forms of attack. Finally, a local coalition of miners has asked for the area to be turned into a great mine, and for railways and minecarts to be brought in for ease of transport. Each of these ideas brings value to the table, so we must consider each very carefully."

That they suffer under a regime that enforces prejudice and turns it into the golden standard? That question is rhetorical, for they know that they may be caught up in whatever pointless conflict that their overlords end up in. It isn’t they, the foolish men who bicker over who is better suited to rule over Bulwar, but the subjects of those people who pay the price for their craze and lust for power.\n\nHow can someone bring peace to the people? This is a question that seems to have no clear answer, for when a kingdom tries to bring about an era of peace, it always seems like their neighbors attack like savage dogs, ripping their lands to shreds and continuing this perpetual cycle of war and conquest. The anomaly though, is clear. We have given the people arable land, safe housing, and a shield to protect them from the terrors that lay along our border. The lands we have restored from the goblins, elven aristocrats, and crazed religious radicals, have welcomed prosperity never before heard of. The people now live alongside each other, elven or human, and even harpy. Outside of our borders though? They bicker like animals. \n\nHow can peace in our time be achieved? The legacy that the Phoenix Empire has left upon Bulwar has been a detriment to all people, of all cultures, in and out of Bulwar. It seeps across the land, guiding people into chaos. Only when you remove the cause does the stench go away. Peace in our time is indeed achievable, but only through the abolishment of the Phoenix Empires Legacy. This will be done, through the removal of its remnant states and the abolishment of the elven stronghold over Bulwar!"
