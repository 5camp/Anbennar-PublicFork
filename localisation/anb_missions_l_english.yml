 A12_trade_league_title:0 "Form a Trade League"
 A12_trade_league_desc:0 "A popular practice among the merchant republics in the Damescrown is forming a league of smaller countries of mutual defense and trade cooperation. If we haven't already done so, doing so now is very important."
 A12_anbenncost_trade_title:0 "Anbenncost Trade"
 A12_anbenncost_trade_desc:0 "A major source of goods entering the Damescrown is ships entering from the south, passing by Anbenncost. Direct control of this trade won't be possible without conquering too far away, but methods such as trade ships, and expanding our newly formed trade league will give us greater influence on the goods entering the Damesneck."
 A12_viswall_trade_title:0 "Small Country Trade"
 A12_viswall_trade_desc:0 "Beepeck's position as the primary route for traders from the Small Country to reach the Dameshead is very valuable. It is time to take full advantage of this and get a near monopoly on halfling trade in the Dameshead."

 A12_utilize_the_estuary_desc:0 "The Widderoy estuary flowing through the Saltmarshes is key to Beepeck's position as controller of the trade from the Small Country. By constructing markets along the river we will use this to its full advantage."
 A12_honey_bacon_title:0 "Honey Bacon"
 A12_honey_bacon_desc:0 "The halflings of the Strip have been farming pigs to supply Beepeck with food for ages now, and the Saltmarshes have always been valuable for the preservation of food. Some methods of preservation have a value beyond just lasting longer though. Salt-curing strips of pork creates a delicious food. Greater production from the Strip allows more to be brought to Beepeck, and for experiments in new tastes. Honey glazed bacon will be a brand new delicacy, attracting traders to Beepeck over other ports for a chance to try it."
 A12_the_honeycomb_title:0 "The Honeycomb"
 A12_the_honeycomb_desc:0 "The Honeycomb is the name of the Beepeck City Treasury. Keeping a backup supply of gold is valuable in case of emergency, and can help mitigate inflation."
 A12_house_stacking_title:0 "House Stacking"
 A12_house_stacking_desc:0 "Halfling house stacking is a famous architecture technique created in Viswall after the Viswall Rebellion. The partition of the city into two halves, and defined borders eliminated the ability for the city to grow further outwards. So instead they grew their city upwards. It's not literally full houses stacked on top of each other, but rather multi-floor buildings with different houses on each floor. Beepeck's peninsula is getting crowded, so introducing this technique will allow for easier growth."
 A12_largest_small_city_title:0 "The Largest Small City"
 A12_largest_small_city_desc:0 "Beepeck has held the nickname of Largest Small City for a while now, but in truth, a united Viswall would be significantly bigger. Truly surpassing Viswall as the Biggest Small City in every respect will greatly increase our power and reach."
 A12_settle_newacre_title:0 "Settle Newacre"
 A12_settle_newacre_desc:0 "Newacre is a sparsely populated part of the duchy of Uelaire with a notable halfling population. It's also good farmland that many more halflings would love to settle on. Simply encouraging more halflings to move in will tip the scale from a Uelairey majority to a halfling majority."
 A12_exwes_mead_title:0 "Mead Brewery"
 A12_exwes_mead_desc:0 "While it was always a possibility, the honey produced from Beepeck has never been used for large scale mead production. This is a missed business opportunity, with the nearest source of mead being all the way in Gerudia. Making it difficult, and therefore expensive to get mead in the Damescrown. With newly available space for our halflings to set up honey farms and mead breweries, we can properly take advantage of this business opportunity."

 A97_conquer_iochand_desc:0 "Iochand was a gnomish duchy in the past. Since recent times though it's been an area split between Reveria and the gnomish city state Portnamm. This land includes the halfling city of Turnwell, which would already be a part of the Small Country if not for outsider meddling. The Portroy river which mostly flows through the Small Country enters the western ocean through the city of Portnamm. So any expansion aimed towards the western ocean should start with Iochand."

 A97_colonial_dalaire_title:0 "Colonize Dalaire"
 A97_colonial_dalaire_desc:0 "Dalaire is not the perfect farmland halflings of the Small Country want, but it's an issue of distance. Ships can easily reach Dalaire, and there are many halflings that would even be willing to live in Dalaire for the chance of their own farmland. It's not all bad, the South is warm enough."
 A97_colonial_noruin_title:0 "Colonize Noruin"
 A97_colonial_noruin_desc:0 "All halflings wish to own their own farm, but with population growing not all of them can find it in the Small Country. Noruin is the perfect destination for any halfling feeling too crowded. Wide open plains, temperate climate, and even new interesting plants to farm."

As a symbol of halfling unification, we have also united their alcohols: combining cider with perry, and distilling the result, has given us an excellent new liquor we have appropriately named after the city of Viswall: Viswall Brandy! While its popularity among halflings owes something to symbolism, its high alcohol content ensures its popularity even further."
