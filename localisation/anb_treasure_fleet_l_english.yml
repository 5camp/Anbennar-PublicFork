 treasurefleet.2.t: "How to deal with Pirates"

 treasurefleet.3.t: "Treasure Fleet in Moduk"
 treasurefleet.3.d: "The Treasure Fleet has arrived in [Root.GetName], seemingly surprised by our occupation of the area. It has historically stopped here as a pit-stop on its way to Haless proper, and would like to continue meeting with the locals. While ship-making developments have made the stop unnecessary, they view it as tradition at this point, and would take offense if we rejected them."

 treasurefleet.7.d: "this event is hidden (might not be for testing purposes)\nthis will add the Port Visited, this is correct as it also works as 'skipped'"
 treasurefleet.7.a: "why are you here"
 
 treasurefleet.8.t: "Treasure Fleet visits [Root.GetName]"
 treasurefleet.8.d31: "[Root.GetName] holds a special place in the hearts of the Treasure Fleet sailors, for they know it is here they find their kin. Distant cousins are reunited, and crowds gather to hear stories of the Federation or simply marvel at the exotic ships. The wealthy merchants native to the city invite their counterparts to banquets and grand exchanges of maritime knowledge.\n\nWhile [Root.GetName] is not the wealthiest city the Fleet visits, it is the one its sailors look forward to the most."
 treasurefleet.8.d32: "A shining and shifting rainbow glimmers above the Gate of Lights as the Treasure Fleet passes under it, and colored explosive 'fireworks' are deployed in celebration of the decennial visitation of the Fleet. The citizens of [Root.GetName] have always gone out of their way to welcome their kin from abroad, but with the wealth of Aelantir now flowing into [Root.GetName], the magnificence of the festivites is unparlleled.\n\nWith [Owner.GetName] ships now frequently visiting the Fleet's homeland, many have taken to view the actual commerce of the Fleet as a formality, and instead the entire city is in a season of holiday until the time comes for the Fleet to set sail again to other ports."
 treasurefleet.8.d51: "As the Treasure Fleet navigates the aptly named Jellyfish Coast, it effortlessly cuts through a bed of thousands of jellyfish, their mindless suspension only momentarily disturbed by the deep draft and wide hulls of the Treasure Fleet. At night, the jellyfish flare up a light bioluminescent blue. The Treasure Fleet is as small pinpricks of darkness, inverted stars in the canvas of the sea. The jellyfish soup starts to thicken as cooling congee does the closer the Fleet gets, signifying arrival in Feiten Bay and, finally, sight of the mouth of the river that sweeps into the ocean the nutrients from inland that make these massive jellyfish blooms possible. \n\nThe city of Feiten itself is a relatively new one, by Yanshen standards, having been just a minor fishing town before Jaher’s invasion. The beneficiaries of waves of refugees and a burgeoning whaling industry, Feiten is a new stop for the Treasure Fleet. No captain’s favorite port, on account of the unescapable smell of rotting whale and underdeveloped facilities of the city, but those considerations paled in comparison to the opportunities for commerce in Feiten. "
 treasurefleet.8.d52: "More than any city, Feiten has embraced the potential of whale oil. The distinctive muddy yellow of hundreds of whale oil fired lamps and buildings blaze into the dark, a guiding light for the Treasure Fleet as it arrives. It is only as the day dawns, as the power of the lamps give way to advancing rays of sunlight, that the other wonder of Feiten is revealed – dozens of hot air balloons, the preferred vessels of the city’s merchant elite. They rise into the sky, their envelopes filled by hot air heated with whale oil. Red streamers, looking much like the tentacles of a jellyfish, slowly unfurl into the misty dawn, casting long shadows on the city below. Although most sailors could not read the ornate gold calligraphy running down the streamers, they could guess that the words likely signified what household or individual each balloon belonged to.\n\nThough the backbone of Feiten’s mercantile power still stood with its seafaring fleet, the balloons enabled far faster and convenient transport for high value, light goods such as certain Raheni spices whose potency could fade during a long ocean voyage. These exotics as well as the ever-expanding catalog of products that could be made from whaling were now the primary exports of Feiten, exports that the Treasure Fleet were now more than happy to exploit."
 treasurefleet.8.d53: "While most other ports along the Treasure Fleet’s route could be taken in with a left to right sweep, this was not the case with Feiten. With the advent of airship technology, Feiten had finally started to conquer the rough hillsides and sheer cliffs that had stymied its growth for so long. What seemed like hundreds of airships of different designs and size crowded the airspace above the city, perched like nesting seabirds on the hillsides.\n\nThe arrival of the Treasure Fleet prompted a clamour of smaller, personal airborne vessels unattaching from their posts and speeding along to the port, all eager to be the first to reach the Treasure Fleet. Goods could be transferred from the airship’s holds to the Treasure Fleets later, but first, there was negotiation to be done!"
 treasurefleet.8.d81: "Two things catch the eye when the Treasure Fleet approaches Keoaden: the mines that sit atop each of the city's many hills, and the Nha Nuhoanha temple. Oh sure, the city has markets and houses and docks of course, but they are dull to the eye when compared to the two features that define the port that claims to be Thidinkai's crowning gem.\n\nOnly roughly a tenth of the vast gem mines are visible to the eye, even as the city nears, given how much they tunnel underground seeking new seams of emerald and ruby and sapphire. Still, they make themselves known, as each gem-bearing hill iis topped with a stout fort flying a host of banners, which ensure their product's safety (even from the mine's employees).\n\nThe great Nha Nuhoanha, on the other hand, is imposing to even the most seasoned of crew-mates. Some may feel a flash of annoyance, given the city's best gems adorn the petrified queens which lay within, and they must trade for the lessers, but most treat it with an awe (if not the reverance) rivalling Keoaden's own residents. A few sailors must look to the docks to pull aside a wharf perhaps a few are belowdecks resting for the night to come, but for all the rest -- the Nha Nuhoanha is all they see as the Treasure Fleet comes into port."
 treasurefleet.8.d131: "This journey is the Treasure Fleet's longest, and the sailors are growing weary as they round the dry cape of Dvipaskaya to approach south-eastern Rahen's greatest port. They are still many miles away when a faint glow becomes visible on the distant coast; a first-timer might worry the city has caught fire, but as the fleet nears, the light's true provenance becomes clear.\n\nIt is Rahen's blazing sun, reflecting off the gold-plated roofs of Sarkhashabid's many palaces. Though not as abundant as those that litter the Dhenbasana plain, these vast abodes more than make up for it in grandeur. After all, they are home to some of the Raheni most adherent to the Silk Turban school, who seek to emulate the High Gods themselves by means of becoming as rich as possible.\n\nAs the fleet approaches the port, and the palaces grow larger in view, other features catch the eye as well: the marble imported all the way from Shazstundihr, polished to a shine; dark wood cut from the Deepwoods, which seems to still have a faint glow. It is only when pulling into the wharves that the port-side slums become salient, where the lower castes eke out a living. They will be delivering the goods off-loaded here, but will consume none of them -- after all, any business the Treasure Fleet has is with Sarkhashabid's harimari elite (and perhaps a few particularly entrepreneurial middle-castes)."
 treasurefleet.8.d: "Continuing on its decennial journey across the eastern seas of Haless, the Treasure Fleet makes its stop here at the ports of [Root.GetName]. Our goods will be sold, their goods will be bought, and the local economy flourishes for a precious few weeks before the Fleet departs again."
 treasurefleet.8.a: "Another profitable visit!"

 treasurefleet.12.a: "Glory"
 
 treasurefleet.13.t: "Treasure Fleet visits [Root.Owner.GetName] in [Root.GetName]"
 treasurefleet.13.d: "Glimmering lights, explosive fireworks, local teas, and goods from across Eastern Haless await the Treasure Fleet in [Root.GetName]. Even the festivities of years past pale in comaprison to the splendor and wealth on display during the Fleet's visitation to the port that has become its second home.\n\nWidely considered the mercantile event of the decade in Haless if not the entire world, goods from all over the world find their way to the many shops on the many streets the merchants make their way down. What was once a few weeks of merryment still remains, but now it is followed by entire months of commerce as well as diplomacy.\n\nIt is only after half a year that the numerous sails of the Treasure Fleet raise once more, and sail out to the sea again ceremoniously escorted by the finest vessels [Root.Owner.GetName] has to offer. While the departure is traditionally during the day, the guiding lights are tuned to their maximum capacity, and are still visible to the sailors one last time that night to bid the Gate of Lights one last farewell."
 treasurefleet.13.a: "Wealth is grandest when shared with family."
