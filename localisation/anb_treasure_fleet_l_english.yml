 treasurefleet.7.a: "why are you here"
 
 treasurefleet.8.t: "Treasure Fleet visits [Root.GetName]"
 treasurefleet.8.d31: "[Root.GetName] holds a special place in the hearts of the Treasure Fleet sailors, for they know it is here they find their kin. Distant cousins are reunited, and crowds gather to hear stories of the Federation or simply marvel at the exotic ships. The wealthy merchants native to the city invite their counterparts to banquets and grand exchanges of maritime knowledge.\n\nWhile [Root.GetName] is not the wealthiest city the Fleet visits, it is the one its sailors look forward to the most."
 treasurefleet.8.d32: "A shining and shifting rainbow glimmers above the Gate of Lights as the Treasure Fleet passes under it, and colored explosive 'fireworks' are deployed in celebration of the decennial visitation of the Fleet. The citizens of [Root.GetName] have always gone out of their way to welcome their kin from abroad, but with the wealth of Aelantir now flowing into [Root.GetName], the magnificence of the festivites is unparlleled.\n\nWith [owner.GetName] ships now frequently visiting the Fleet's homeland, many have taken to view the actual commerce of the Fleet as a formality, and instead the entire city is in a season of holiday until the time comes for the Fleet to set sail again to other ports."
 treasurefleet.8.d81: "Two things catch the eye when the Treasure Fleet approaches Keoaden: the mines that sit atop each of the city's many hills, and the Nha Nuhoanha temple. Oh sure, the city has markets and houses and docks of course, but they are dull to the eye when compared to the two features that define the port that claims to be Thidinkai's crowning gem.\n\nOnly roughly a tenth of the vast gem mines are visible to the eye, even as the city nears, given how much they tunnel underground seeking new seams of emerald and ruby and sapphire. Still, they make themselves known, as each gem-bearing hill iis topped with a stout fort flying a host of banners, which ensure their product's safety (even from the mine's employees).\n\nThe great Nha Nuhoanha, on the other hand, is imposing to even the most seasoned of crew-mates. Some may feel a flash of annoyance, given the city's best gems adorn the petrified queens which lay within, and they must trade for the lessers, but most treat it with an awe (if not the reverance) rivalling Keoaden's own residents. A few sailors must look to the docks to pull aside a wharf perhaps a few are belowdecks resting for the night to come, but for all the rest -- the Nha Nuhoanha is all they see as the Treasure Fleet comes into port."
 treasurefleet.8.d131: "This journey is the Treasure Fleet's longest, and the sailors are growing weary as they round the dry cape of Dvipaskaya to approach south-eastern Rahen's greatest port. They are still many miles away when a faint glow becomes visible on the distant coast; a first-timer might worry the city has caught fire, but as the fleet nears, the light's true provenance becomes clear.\n\nIt is Rahen's blazing sun, reflecting off the gold-plated roofs of Sarkhashabid's many palaces. Though not as abundant as those that litter the Dhenbasana plain, these vast abodes more than make up for it in grandeur. After all, they are home to some of the Raheni most adherent to the Silk Turban school, who seek to emulate the High Gods themselves by means of becoming as rich as possible.\n\nAs the fleet approaches the port, and the palaces grow larger in view, other features catch the eye as well: the marble imported all the way from Shazstundihr, polished to a shine; dark wood cut from the Deepwoods, which seems to still have a faint glow. It is only when pulling into the wharves that the port-side slums become salient, where the lower castes eke out a living. They will be delivering the goods off-loaded here, but will consume none of them -- after all, any business the Treasure Fleet has is with Sarkhashabid's harimari elite (and perhaps a few particularly entrepreneurial middle-castes)."
