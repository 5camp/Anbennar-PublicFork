 anjiang_words_of_wisdom_title:0 "Words of Wisdom"
 anjiang_words_of_wisdom_desc:0 "The seers of Tughayasa have long since been among our closest allies. While logistics have typically made direct military support impossible, the boons of this kinship are far more valuable than any number of blades. The seers are possessed of a gift in foresight - a gift they are willing to share the spoils of with us. It is imperative that we do not allow this relationship to fade."
 anjiang_pull_back_curtain_title:0 "Pull Back The Curtain"
 anjiang_pull_back_curtain_desc:0 "Dark tidings arrive from the seers - Our erstwhile allies in Yingzhin are, according to their sight, plotting some grand scheme against us. \n\nWhile we may not be fortunate enough to know the details quite yet, we at least know where to find them."
 anjiang_often_travelled_title:0 "A Path Often Travelled"
 anjiang_often_travelled_desc:0 "The road between our lands and Tughayasa are controlled by a number of different powers. While many welcome the business that the steady stream of our envoys provides, others require a more discrete course. We must ensure that our runners can reliably navigate those foreign rodes, be it by friendship or subterfuge."
 anjiang_blade_evil_title:0 "A Blade Against Evil"
 anjiang_blade_evil_desc:0 "The wretches of Jinqiu have been a threat to the League for as long as anyone can remember - doubly so since the fall of Caoying granted them a direct border to our own lands. While their cities are by no doubt grander than ours, they remain politically isolated. \n\nA proper coalition of states may very well prove sufficient to restore the League's lands, and more besides."
 anjiang_strike_first_title:0 "Strike First"
 anjiang_strike_first_desc:0 "With the truth revealed, Yingzhin has been by large ousted from the League. With neighbors on all sides eyeing hungrily at their lands, a great many of our own ranks call to return the smallfolk of the area to the League's protection. \n\nUnder our banner this time, of course."
 anjiang_blade_red_title:0 "A Blade Stained Red"
 anjiang_blade_red_desc:0 "Even further west lie the Oni and their tributaries. Demons and corruptors of men, these horned beasts are even more wicked than the monsters of Jinqiu! \n\nThese monsters, and the men who have made pacts with them, must be put to the sword so that the land may be put to righteous use by righteous men, such as ourselves. What's more, a second successful military campaign might just win the favor of other states of the League."
 anjiang_second_seat_title:0 "Second Seat of the Oracles"
 anjiang_second_seat_desc:0 "In recent years, the section of the Golden Highway between our capitol and Tughayasa has been increasingly known as 'The Seers' Walk'. Many of our land's promising students venture to their mountains for tutelage, and many of their Oracles spend as much time in our lands as they do theirs. \n\nTo many, Anjiang is already called 'The Second Seat of The Oracles'. We must ensure our capitol is worthy of the title."
 anjiang_summit_river_title:0 "Summit Of The River"
 anjiang_summit_river_desc:0 "Recent years have seen our once-strong League fracture and fade. Territory has been lost, allies have turned against us, and even the ill-fated city of Tsaicun chose to die alone rather than stand at our side. A summit has been proposed of the remaining members of the League - one where we shall seek out a unification of our states. \n\n"
