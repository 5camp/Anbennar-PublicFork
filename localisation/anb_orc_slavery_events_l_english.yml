 orc_slavery.1.d:0 "After the Greentide many orcs were captured and sold to slavery by both enterprising adventurers and fledgling orcish states alike to the civilized realms of Cannor, with cities like Vertesk profiting greatly. By the Age of Unraveling orcish slaves were the staple amongst the colonial empires of Aelantir, filling its plantations with expendable and cheap manpower, even if the practice of orc slave ownership had dwindled in Cannor.\n\nOur colonial governors report that the province of [Root.GetName] has built up a sizeable orcish minority because of this."
