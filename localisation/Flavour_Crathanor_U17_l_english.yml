The Crathanori Merchant Class extends a hand of mercy and invites them to write a new constitution, and despite the ability to completely bully them into cooperating, the ex-nobles and clergy are surprised at the level of dignity and respect they are still showed.

In spite of this, two individuals, one RC and one NSC, stand out, quiet and observant, they seem to lock and and be in agreement, this cannot continue, they both seek the Prosperity of Crathanor, and in order for it to happen, this must not continue. In the midst of all this chaos, they shake hands, intent on making this dream a reality. For now, the Regent Court adherents demand the construction of more temples across our lands, in order to ensure the worship of the Court does not become subsumed by NSC worship, and in exchange they . The NSC adherents are unhappy, but ultimately are convinced to concede, with the promise of future favors by our president, as they fruitlessly try to speak of cooperation and harmony, with the possibility of syncretism a distant dream for now."

Adherents of the Court are pleased by our fulfillment of our promise, however the NSC is quick to remind our leader of the promise of favors they made. They demand we fully take all of Bahar, and allow the NSC clergy (we only took land from the RC clergy earlier on),to deal with and stomp out both the OSC heretics and the Goblinic heathens. Should we fulfill this, we will be one step closer to ensuring their further support for our dream of Religious harmony, and th. The RC is satisfied with this, on the condition that Ourdia be fully RC. The President attempts once more to speak of cooperation and harmony, but they realize without appeasing either side first, they will not listen."

 flavor_crathanor.11.t:0 "The Third Theological Debate"
 flavor_crathanor.11.d:0 "The Third Theological Debate begins with a surprisingly pleasant calm, as members sit down and discuss with each other, their emotions blunted by time. The NSC adherents in parliament are very pleased that we kept our promise, and they will begin preparations to convert the heretics and heathens of Bahar shortly. With both the Court and Cult adherents pleased, the president themself begins their speech. Both sides listen attentively, as the president once more speaks of peace, cooperation, and above all harmony between the Court and the Cult. For the first time since the debates began, adherents to both sides quietly begin to reconsider and agree with the president. The President finally makes his last proposal, that with the newfound unity in the country, Castellos and Surael are one and the same. That Castellos, the head god of the Regent Court, is in fact Surael. Adherents to both are stunned, however with their newfound trust in the state, they do not immediately react with outrage. Slowly, people both within parliament and outside begin to see the truth in the President's words, and philosophers, priests, and every thinker low and high begin to slowly embrace this new syncretism."
