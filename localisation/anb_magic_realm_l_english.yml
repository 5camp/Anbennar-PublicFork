 magic_realm_transmutation.3.d:0 "\"The perfect familiar, the perfect servant, the perfect companion. A being made of pure alchemy... and its alive... ITS ALIVE!\"\n-A Mad Alchemist\n\nA Homunculus (plural: Homunculi) is the ultimate construct, an artificial being brought to life through pure alchemy alone. Perfect Homunculi more often than not take the idealized form of its creator's race, and while they have a telepathic bond and undying loyalty to their creator (unless the creator proves otherwise), they are fully sentient and independent beings. Homunculi do not reproduce nor age, but if well maintained can be preserved indefinitely.\n\nAll Homunculi share the base properties of any construct: they cannot be poisoned or intoxicated, nor can they feel pain in the same way living creatures do - though depending on the creator's intent, they can choose to mimic such things that blur the lines of difference.\n\nEach Homunculi is built to serve a specific purpose or goal, and as such may have different traits and appearances. However, most if not all are gifted with enchanced physical prowess in addition to greatly empowered learning capabilities, allowing them to learn and master any craft with ease. Despite their magical origins however, they are incapable of learning magic, but are instead immune to all its effects."
