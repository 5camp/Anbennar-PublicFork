    flavor_ravenmarch.2.d:0 "Having traveled through the narrow pass along the Karnvrord river in the Godshield Mountains, our emmisaries find themselves in the dark forested hills of the Blackwoods. Once the Vertbern Basin was proudly populated by the Korbarid peoples, until their oppression under Castanor following Daravan's disaster forced them into poverty. By the occupation by the Phoenix Empire in the 11th century, only the Blackwoods remained proudly Korbarid. In these past four centuries, they have dwindled ever further, with their nobles being replaced by elvenized-Corvurians and their lands being squandered under oppressive feudal law. \n\nUs Ravenmarchers and Korbarids of the Blackwoods are kindred; our people are composed primarily of the same Korbarid people who instead persisted and endured in the mire-soaked Folly. So too have we endured hardships under the Corvurian crown and forced into bleak conditions. But now the Korbarids of the Ravenmarch have claimed a verdant land in which we are finally free to prosper! \n\nWe offer our cousins in the Blackwoods a hope for the future: we can ensure that they find peace in our state, free from Corvurian oppression. But the elders of the Korbarids disagree, having long been disillusioned by generations of hardship. They state that any such proclamation from us would only cause them more suffering, but that should we need it they may assist us by sabotaging Corvuria from within. The day comes to a close, and the secret summit with it."

A servant wearing a simple red mask, hands [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] a fine glass of Toarnen Black, before swiftly departing, leaving [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to survey the ballroom.\n\nSizing up the ballroom, three people catch [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s eye. Standing on the terrace, a man in a grinning oni mask swirls his wine, alone but for his thoughts. Engaged in conversation, a woman in an ornate bird mask lightly laughs before starting to cross the floor. Near the front of the ballroom, a tall man in a fanged wolf mask cracks a joke, causing the people around him to chuckle before moving on, leaving him alone."

A pleasure to meet you. Tell me, do you know much about governance? I happen to manage many estates and keeping them all running smoothly is quite a task, why one time…" It’s clear that he intends to go on for some time."

"Ah, delighted to meet you.", she says as she drops into a curtsy, "These affairs lose so much of their charm when there are no new faces, so I make sure to keep an ear out for fresh blood. Tell me, what are your thoughts on Escann? Many here view it as a backwater that we are lucky to have the Godshield preventing us from being associated with. Old money and power like them find any change distasteful, no matter what it is.""

Would you care to join me? I assure you that here only those of appropriate pedigree are allowed. The only commoners present know their place is beneath us, serving our drinks." He throws back his half-full glass of wine as a servant passes, before snatching another one out of their hands. "You simply have to keep them on their toes, so they know their place, wouldn’t you agree?""

    flavor_ravenmarch.8.d:0 "As you spend the evening in conversation, drinking wine, and dancing, [Root.Monarch.GetName] cannot help but notice that as the masquerade progresses, more and more people seem to be eyeing them. As a servant hands you another glass of Toarnen Black, a young man with a crimson and gold mask firmly bumps you from behind with their shoulder, almost causing [Root.Monarch.GetName] to spill the full glass.\n\n"It looks like the entertainment has arrived everyone!", the young man shouts, smirking, "Watch as a backwater provincial tries to blend in with real nobility! Tell me, does the far side of the Godshield have civilization, or is it just rabble emulating their betters and pretending they saved the world from something that couldn’t even leave Escann? You adventurers who went off to fight, tell me, did they teach you how to use a sword, or did they simply have you punch the orcs?""
    flavor_ravenmarch.8.a:0 "Shall I show you how we fight in [Root.Country.GetName], or are you too soft to duel?"

[Root.Monarch.GetName] selects a simple, practical saber, with filigree on the handguard, while their opponent selects an ornate, engraved rapier.\n\nA murmur ripples through the attentive crowd as both take up dueling stances.\n\nThe young man unleashes a rapid barrage of thrusts and feints, pressing [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s guard, before dropping low and thrusting upwards. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] dives out of the way, landing in a roll and slashing as they rise. While the young man pivots to face [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], the tip of the saber presses to his throat. The room is silent save for the sound of his sliced cape falling to the ground and his voice calling out.\n\n"Clearly I was misinformed about [Root.Country.GetAdjective] skill with a blade. I yield.""

    flavor_ravenmarch.12.d:0 "In the weeks after the masquerade, word has spread of the chivalrous behavior of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Many clergymen and pious nobles have reached out with offers of assistance and public donations. Several sermons in the many steeples of Gablainé have highlighted how [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] embodies the might and honor of Corin, the grace of Ryala, and the keen judgment of Nerat. Should we accept their offers, our standing in the eyes of the faithful will surely rise."

    flavor_ravenmarch.13.d:0 "A gasp ripples through the crowd as the saber opens the impertinent duelist’s throat, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] tosses the sword to the ground with a clatter, before calmly spinning and walking through them to an empty balcony, shutting the door behind them. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] places their arms on the balcony and leans over the edge, from the side, a voice speaks.\n\n"That was quite an impressive display of swordsmanship. While many of us had our eyes on you and your nation, I feel confident in saying that with the… eagerness you dispatched that young lordling, many of us would be happy to lend you some assistance."\n\nGlancing around, [Root.Monarch.GetName] notices a man dressed in crimson formalwear who was not on the balcony a moment ago.\n\n"I represent a group of individuals who have been handling power with similar ruthlessness for far longer than most of those you left inside. We can offer your foundling nation many opportunities, provided your taste for blood extends to more than just ballroom dueling.""

    flavor_ravenmarch.14.d:0 "After the display at the masquerade ball, several nobles have spoken out about the treatment of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] at the gala. Some have donated portions of their wealth to the state, while others have offered to assist in other ways."

    flavor_ravenmarch.15.d:0 "After closing shut the small door, your eyes slowly begin to adjust to the dim room. Three windows scatter light into the room: from the red shield and sword the strongest light of the noon sun shines, the intermediate from a heart with two rings with remnants of the morning sun, and the dimmest from a the set of scales that has yet to receive the evening glare. Situated where they converge is a simple pedestal and altar, displaying a thick book with a long red ribbon marking yesterday's readings. \n\nThis chapel of the Triumvirate Court has long been your favorite, situated in a forgotten corner of the palace, a far cry from the grand cathedrals of Vernham. But yet it is here you prefer to read and ponder, away from the bustle of the grand temple and responsibilities of court. Within the prayerbook are the traditional recountings of the gods of the Regent Court, along with the new writings of the heroine Corin protecting all of Cannor with her own life. The goddess Ryala features prevalently, a favorite of the Ravenmarchers since long before they left Dostanor. A noble lady and a gallant knight, a lowly maid and humble farmer; both virtuous and industrious, elope and utter their vows to each other, a comforting reminder of love to the suffering peoples. So too does Nerat, Judge of the Dead; All must wither and crumble into dust, but in his charge all are judged fairly on their actions in life. \n\nWhich of the Triumvirate deserves your praise? Ryala the Maiden of Love, Corin the Guardian, or Judge Nerat?"

Of late the curious emmisaries from the Ravenmarch have graced your court with their bold claims, and it seems that they are calling upon your favor today. They claim the lands of the Daravan's Folly, despite it being a putrid and worthless mire, and call for you to heed no call to assist the Imperial prince who squats upon it."

Searching for the buried civilization of Dostanor has so far been unremarkable, only uncovering stone foundations and the odd trinket.

While originally intended to publish information that we deem important for the public, the insolent printers have taken to producing illegal pamphlets behind the scenes. Not only do they disrespect our government and its policies, they are also pushing out the honest industries of the city. Most recently they have even claimed that our government has been repressing the free printers with vampiric assasins! The affected guildsman have petitioned your government to place heavy regulations on the printing industry, and arrest and prosecute the libel spreaders."

Day by day the land has recuperated, with flora growing tall and fauna multiplying. Maybe even one day it will be possible for this land to prosper on its own without magical assistance. \n\nNatural scholars have studied the impact of our spells on the land, and have concluded that with some alterations of the ongoing rituals the land may be exploited. They have prepared a list of natural goods that may be possible to produce: clean salt from the brackish waters, sour but bearable wine, fur from estuarine rodents, and gargantuan mushrooms that thrive in the waterlogged mire."

And with our glorious reconquest of Dostanor, we find our possessions seperated into disparate regions. The newly reclaimed lands in the Folly remain the farthest from our governance, with New Corveld being the only center of civilization. In the tainted Vertbern Basin, the Order of the Ruby Scale struggles to fight the damned creatures of the night. \n\nIn these changing times, it may be best to establish a new capital to govern the newly reformed Dostanor. But we are torn between two different homes: one nostalgic of glory long buried in the marshes of Daravan's Folly, and the home we have established in Old Vernham. Gablainé, while being the heart of a Corvuria that was cruel to us, may serve the best chance to embolden our hold over the region and establish our Corinite faith throughout the region."

You turn as a velvety darkness douses the pale moonlight, and replaces it with a heady perfumed vision. \n\n'I hope I haven't kept you waiting,' a fanged tooth glints, 'it would not do if you were to drop from exhaustion. You've not quite got the strength of your father. Say, I could do for a refreshment,' the Lady states as she saunters over to the upholstered chair and beckons towards a wine ewer. Despite the darkness of the room, her jet-black hair and elaborate gown is all but indistinguishable.'  \n\n'Well don't just stare, we've got some very important work to discuss! My little birds have twittered across many leagues: I'm sure they have gossip you might enjoy.' She hands you a scroll almost as pale as her hand. Is that ruby red stain from blood, or the wine she just spilled? 'I'll give you a moment to read it and ponder.' \n\n................ \n\n'I hope that's been enough time; you cannot possibly be that dense.

While this order may operate in the shadows away from the view of the public, the Neratic Inquisition respects that all should be given a chance at trial. Or perhaps they delight in seeing their prey beg for mercy, before delivering slow and deliberate punishment? \n\nBut today the Neratic Inquisition has acted outside your wishes. Normally working with cooperation with the Lady's Birds on apprehending rogue vampires, the Inquisition has delivered justice on their own terms.

But not everything has to built anew: a small perfumery operating out of a temple to Ryala has become popular recently. With some funding and expansion of their operations, the sensation of smell may be pleasant instead of noxious. An illusionary world built for those who need nothing but distraction."

    ravenmarch_daravans_folly_desc:0 "Mundane means can only do so much to reverse Daravan's Folly, for cursed magic has permeated and forever ruined this land. No matter how much we divert the channels and drain the marshes, it will not help with the ever-present withering. But what was once ruined by magic, may be restored by it. Through our long campaign in Escann, we have found great use for the magical arts, even those not sanctioned by the Magisterium. And so too does our ancient Korbarid blood bolster our arcane abilities, that once empowered Daravan himself. We will stud the Folly with magical circles across the ley lines, and when all the mages are assembled, we will bathe the land in more magic that has ever been seen since that fateful day."

Let us give our veterans one last task: to protect them on their way, so they all can settle the Ravenmarch together."

The self-proclaimed lord of Corveld, Jergan lead his band of equally landless nobles throughout Daravan's Folly. A tall-tale of high adventure, tragedy, and romance was told across the land of Jergan's endless struggle against the Flamemarked Gnolls. \n\nBut behind every legend is a nugget of truth: Jergan and his compatriots were extraordinary cavalrymen, despite dwelling in the cursed swamp. They spared no expense to keep their steeds healthy and strong, and wisely knew when to eschew armor for mobility. After leaving Daravan's Folly for Escann, Jergan and his fellows kept their old habits. Sometimes seen as deranged by adventurer captains, Jergan and his men routed Greentide hosts with charges across terrain once deemd impassible to cavalry. \n\nThe Sons of the Mire have pledged to hold onto these proud traditions, with many commanding vast influence in the realm. Once humble mirelords mocked by society, they are now beloved heroes."

We will give the last Korbarids the protection they deserve, for if Corvuria was once the heir to the Korbarid Kingdom, it has lost its right and its claim.
