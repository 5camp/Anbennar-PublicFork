 flavor_lodhum.1.t:0 "The Reign of Gerin Orcrend"
 flavor_lodhum.1.d:0 "Once, Gerin Orcrend was a Castellyrian adventurer. Once, he awoke to hundreds of Orcs dead at his hand, and a dead friend beside him. Once, he decided to single-handedly purge the Dwarovar of orcs. Once, he saw the Greentide march, and he slew what he could but trusted in the White Walls of Castellyr to hold off the rest. (Once, he was wrong). Once, he saw the potential of the Dwarovar unfurl before him, a whisper of the greatness that was and that could be again.\n\nOnce, he met a dwarf named Dwalra. Once, he failed to hold off the Orcish assault that saw her husband killed, her son Balgar made fatherless. Once, Dwalra fell in love with him. Once, married, they returned to the Hold of her birth. And once, Gerin's possession of the sapphire gem of the Dwarovkron and the sword that had won him the name Orcrend saw him elected as Lord Mayor, to lead the Hold's rebirth.\n\nBut that was long ago. Now, he walks with the support of a cane, and leaves his sword at home. Now, the scars blur together, as the details of their woundings fade from view. Now, he rests easy, sleeps at night without fear of being set upon by Orcs, surrounded by walls he has inspected and guards he has trained. And now he can sit, and watch his son learn to lead.\n\nAnd soon he shall sleep, knowing Ovdal Lodhum shall lead the Dwarovar's reclamation. But as long as dwarves inhabit the Dwarovar, there shall be legends of the one they call Trickster, the one they call Orcrend, the faceless figure who had slain hundreds of thousands of orcs, a number matched by none before or since."

 flavor_lodhum.10.t:0 "The Wounded Elf"
 flavor_lodhum.10.d:0 "Our patrols just beyond the labyrinths of Verkal Skomdihr do not tend to be all that eventful, save the encounter with the occasional goblin or orc raider. This time, however, they came across a badly wounded elf, leaning against a tree, who was passing in and out of consciousness. After he was brought into the hold to recover, we tried to find out what happened to him. We could not understand him, but after he was handed a piece of chalk he drew a figure that every dwarf in the room recognized. Angry grumbling and cursing filled the room, and the elf recoiled in fear before he realized that not he, but the orc he had drawn, was the target of our rage. When the dwarves had calmed down after every last one of them had personally sworn vengeance, the elf managed to explain through gestures and further drawings that his clan still survived, but was hard-pressed by the wars with the orcs and goblins."

 flavor_lodhum.10.a:0 "We will not allow our ancestral enemy to wipe out another civilization!"
 flavor_lodhum.10.b:0 "His vengeance is our vengeance, these monsters will know our anger!"

 flavor_lodhum.11.t:0 "A Land in Turmoil"
 flavor_lodhum.11.d:0 "We have just begun to receive comprehensive reports from our scouts out of the Serpentreach to re-establish contact with the lands to our south. In doing so, we have encountered someone in the territory outside of Glogund Cave, an injured human from the lands of Bulwar, a realm of hills, rivers, and sand baked by the heat of the sun. This is not the first time in our memory that we have found a human seeking sanctuary and respite. We have learned he is a Gelkali, from the lands often known as Gelaklis- and of that realm's plight. His homeland struggles- or suffers, the grasp we hold of his language is poor, so it is to make one from the other, but we have learned goblins came in hordes into his people's lands- a tide of goblins spawned by Dookanson's war to unite the orc clans no doubt, and that elves of another kind have essentially made humanity second-class citizens in their own realms.  A species of winged women-birds our records indicate to be called harpies have also harassed this land for centuries, abducting males of many species in order to mate and propagate their own kind. Bulwar is a land torn by struggle and strife, and...."
 flavor_lodhum.11.a:0 "...it seems orcs aren't the only evil"


 flavor_lodhum.12.t:0 "Another Grudge"
 flavor_lodhum.12.d:0 "Love can come in many forms, many pleasant, some dark and others twisted. In this case, it is not even one of those times. Our delegation to Arg-Ordstun has returned, battered and evidently unwelcome. They were met at the gates and their case heard, but what came next was unexpected and unacceptable. They called us love-blind fools, insinuating relations with orcs and goblins to pass the days in our hold, and say that if we truly love dwarfkind, we will kneel to Arg-Ordstun and perhaps after we have proven our worth, treat us as if we were a favoured pet or tool, throwing rock dust to hasten their departure. This insult to us cannot go unanswered. The leadership of Arg-Ordstun must pay."
 flavor_lodhum.12.a:0 "We offer love and friendship and they mock us?"



 flavor_lodhum.13.t:0 "In the Halls of the Mountain King"
 flavor_lodhum.13.d:0 "A dwarven hold is nothing less than an architectural marvel. An example would be no less than the Warding Gate of Verkal Skomdihr. While the wards themselves broke during the Day of Ashen Skies, the physical structure itself is an example of lasting dwarven engineering. But to the average Dwarf, these miracles are commonplace. As they live in these holds for their whole lives, their grand and ancient halls are all that they know. So when the first visitors started arriving, we were unprepared for the feelings of wonder and awe. Thus we are reminded of why we carry on the legacy of our ancestors and  why we remember their names. It is because they built the world in which we stand. It is through the eyes of our foreign friends and allies that we see our home for what it truly is, and take pride once more in our heritage."

There was the death of a trickster, the death of a nightmare, when he put down his sword and took up a wife and a son and a cane.\n\nNow, he has faced another death.

 lodhum_down_railway_desc:0 "The majority of the other holds of the Serpentreach can be reached by following the old ruined tracks of the Argrod westward. Verkal Skomdihr, the shield against the Deepwood. Arg-Ôrdstun, ever fiercely defiant. Shazstundihr, the Marble Gate. Orlghelovar, home of the Glasslords. Have they survived, like us?

 lodhum_wooden_door_desc:0 "Though we had not laid eyes on it for many centuries, stories about the Deepwood remained popular among our people. It has a very romantic quality about itself: dangerous but beautiful, magical but treacherous. During the time of Aul-Dwarov, Verkal Skomdihr stood as the bulwark against it and the gateway to it. In spite of its labyrinthine entranceways and warding magic, however, it has fallen long ago, with orcs defiling its ruined halls. Let us reclaim and rebuild it, and let it fulfill its old purpose."

But after the event which emptied the Dwarovar of hundreds of thousands of orcs they, like many others it seems, have come to reclaim their ancestral homeland. Let us then prove that there is a home for them to return to, one with open loving arms, and make use of their new ideas and ways of thinking."

One faction wants to cling to how things were, and isolate the Deepwood from the outside world. Another faction, however, rejects this stagnation. They want Cyranvar to become a proper nation in its own right, and a force for good in the world.

From the territory of Glogund cave to the border of Gelkalis, merchants and diplomats must cross a stretch of territory not controlled by either party, where brigands, bandits, and worst of all goblins roam. We must clear out the infestation and make their territory stretch all the way to our borders- not only will this allow safe travel between our realms, it will give the Gelkali more space to live and breathe beyond their cramped mountainous domains."

For eons, the harpies of Harpylen have raided their villages and towns for men for their roosts, or allowed invaders through the pass to ravage their lands. Next came Jaher and the Sun Elves, and the theft of their religion, Jaher's elven followers bending it to their purpose, suppressing the human's mages and making magic the province strictly of elvenkind, taking from them a powerful means to defend themselves. Finally, came the goblins, who came spilling from Glogund Cave and Shazstundihr creating a period known as the Decades of Devastation. It is up to us to liberate these people from any goblin threat, aid the Gelkali in creating a strong, stable state, and ensure that the threat of the harpies in the surrounding mountains are put to an end."

 lodhum_end_raids_desc:0 "The harpies of the hills have raided the Gelkali people since time immemorial, taking the men they capture, mating with them, and then either letting them go, killing, or kidnapping them back to their roosts. Two of these three options end in the loss of loved ones, and one of these leads to angry loved ones. Enough is enough. The people of Gelkalis have suffered enough! The raids must end!"

 lodhum_respite_desc:0 "The elves of the Deepwood have become very adept at living alongside the fey. However, this is an arduous existence, and some elves have started to seek out the quiet and the solitude of the caverns around Verkal Skomdihr to rest and meditate before returning to the woods. Some have even chosen to stay there, setting up small sanctuaries for those seeking a respite from the fey."
 lodhum_wooden_horsies_title:0 "Wooden Horses"
 lodhum_wooden_horsies_desc:0 "The abundance of high-quality wood that we now have access to from Cyranvar has inspired a lot of new uses by enterprising artisans in Verkal Skomdihr. The most popular use, however, has been making toys for children. These new toymakers create elaborate wooden puzzle boxes and wooden puppets, but also simpler things like wooden horses."

The armies of Ovdal Lodhum can now sometimes be seen using the rapid attack strategies of the elves, while the armies of Cyranvar have adopted some of our closed defensive formations. But more than that, many a dwarven soldier now has an elven brother in arms, whom they have fought alongside for many battles."

 lodhum_mountain_love_title:0 "A Mountain of Love"
 lodhum_mountain_love_desc:0 "The Serpentreach has seen many centuries of conflict and turmoil, but those have come to an end. Through our efforts, we have reclaimed it and made it safe again and free of any orcish taint. But we could not have made such strides alone. With help from the Gelkali and harpies of Bulwar, and the Wood Elves of Cyranvar to protect us from the dangers of the surface, we have acted in turn to defend them from the dangers of the Dwarovar that spilled forth as consequences of the Greentide as well as from each other. It is only right, then, that they too are able to experience the wonders of the Dwarovar like we do. Let us throw wide our gates to our surface dwelling allies and show them what love has wrought.”

Composting orc corpses can only do so much, and after a time you run out of orc corpses. A more long term solution can be found in Bulwar. The land is rich, its farmland fed by rivers which collect the silt of a dozen lands. Let us make an offer to various individuals throughout Bulwar- dwarven yellow gold for their bulwari rich and loamy gold. It will take some time for the caverns we have chosen for this project to be completely overhauled like this as we supplant the existing industries, but it will be well worth it."
 lodhum_vineyards_title:0 "Vineyards in the Caves"
 lodhum_vineyards_desc:0 "Wine has always held a special place in our hearts, it's the drink of love. With the new soil we will make vineyards, but our people are very inexperienced in tending to these and will take a while for them to adapt. Wine, regardless of its origins and those who drink it, has been a symbol of love and romance. Thus, it is only fitting that we turn these new cave-farms of ours into places where a unique vintage unlike any other in the world can be grown. However, we are not farmers by trade or heritage, so it will take time for our workers in these vinyards to really begin accumulating the experience necessary. Regardless, however, this labour of love will be seen through so the lovers of our hold may drink a wine that is truly made from love."

The harpies we have encountered through Gelkalis seem to be more intelligent, and more amicable to words than an orc or a goblin however. We should strive towards an understanding with these harpies more, and protect them. They are, ultimately, only driven to their actions by the need to find a partner and that is something any dwarf of Ovdal Lodhum can understand."
