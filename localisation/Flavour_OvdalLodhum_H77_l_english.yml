 flavor_lodhum.1.t:0 "The Reign of Gerin Orcrend"
 flavor_lodhum.1.d:0 "Once, Gerin Orcrend was a Castellyrian adventurer. Once, he awoke to hundreds of Orcs dead at his hand, and a dead friend beside him. Once, he decided to single-handedly purge the Dwarovar of orcs. Once, he saw the Greentide march, and he slew what he could but trusted in the White Walls of Castellyr to hold off the rest. (Once, he was wrong). Once, he saw the potential of the Dwarovar unfurl before him, a whisper of the greatness that was and that could be again.\n\nOnce, he met a dwarf named Dwalra. Once, he failed to hold off the Orcish assault that saw her husband killed, her son Balgar made fatherless. Once, Dwalra fell in love with him. Once, married, they returned to the Hold of her birth. And once, Gerin's possession of the sapphire gem of the Dwarovkron and the sword that had won him the name Orcrend saw him elected as Lord Mayor, to lead the Hold's rebirth.\n\nBut that was long ago. Now, he walks with the support of a cane, and leaves his sword at home. Now, the scars blur together, as the details of their woundings fade from view. Now, he rests easy, sleeps at night without fear of being set upon by Orcs, surrounded by walls he has inspected and guards he has trained. And now he can sit, and watch his son learn to lead.\n\nAnd soon he shall sleep, knowing Ovdal Lodhum shall lead the Dwarovar's reclamation. But as long as dwarves inhabit the Dwarovar, there shall be legends of the one they call Trickster, the one they call Orcrend, the faceless figure who had slain hundreds of thousands of orcs, a number matched by none before or since."

 flavor_lodhum.4.d:0 "A wounded elf has shown up at skomdihr. we could not understand his language but he managed to draw on the dirt on the forest floor a picture we knew all too well, orcs. At first fear washed over the elf's face because he thought he somehow insulted us. but when a dwarf put his hand on his shoulder with his axe raised, the elf knew the target of our rage (this version is if Salla Ayeth is still alive)"
