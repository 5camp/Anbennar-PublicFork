While it may be possible for the new Castan to refuse to complete the Trials, that would be a decision of great shame.

 castanortrials.98.desc:0 "Every ruler of Castanor has to pass the Trials of Castan to be considered legitimate - that is without question. For most of Castanor's history, the death of a Castan would trigger a scramble for the Trialmount and the Trials, as aspirants competed for the right to become the next Castan. This was the way for centuries, until the Gerudian Ebonfrosts wrested control of the Trials for themselves, instating a policy where only the direct heirs of the Ebonfrost dynasty were allowed onto the Trialmount to take the Trials. We are at a crossroads, as the first to succeed in the Trials in many centuries. With the Trials reinstated now, what shall be our policy?"

 castanortrials.101.t:0 "The Trials of Castan"
 castanortrials.101.desc1:0 "The Trials of Castan - a tradition and mode of succession unique to Castanor - was established in 618 BA. The near-mythical Castan the Progenitor, slain during the First Great Cleansing years after defeating a gnollish invasion headed by the demonic Xhazobine, left behind an interregnum period fraught with uncertainty. The able Castan Beastbane would take up the mantle of Emperor after establishing the Trials of Castan, a series of tests designed to determine a worthy successor for Castanor. Each successive Castan had to pass the Trials left behind by their predecessors, while adding their own test to the Trials at the end.\n\nThe Trials continued on for centuries, until the Sorcerer King brought Castanor crumbling down with his ambitions on the rest of Cannor. His final defeat came at the Battle of Trialmount, where a band composed of Free-Realm heroes and their elven saviors defeated the Sorcerer King. The Trials were irreparably damaged during the battle, its magic either drained, severed, or otherwise rendered useless. Or so everyone thought, at the time.\n\nTo restore Castanor, the first human empire and master of much of Cannor for centuries, our ruler must pass the Trials of Castan, as every ruler of Castanor has done in the past. Starting from the gates of the North Citadel, the traditional setting off point for the Trials, [Root.Monarch.GetName] readies [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] for what would surely be a long and arduous journey."

And even further beyond, one could almost imagine the hazy shimmer of Lake Silvermere.\n\nHere was the trial of Castan V the Great, who heralded a period of near continuous expansion and growth for Castanor millennia past. At the precipice of the ridge was a massive stone desk, with the outline of the entirety of Cannor meticulously scratched on. With a light touch to the unnaturally cold stone, [Root.castanorTrialsNameIdentifier] found that a thin white line appeared wherever they traced their fingers.

 castanortrials.310.desc:0 "The forest starts to thin out as the craggy and imposing face of the Trialmount looms ever closer. Soft and spongy dirt, interlaced with the twists of tree roots, quickly transforms to naked rock. Soon, a deep, wide gash scarring the otherwise smooth path appears, dropping steeply down into a valley. This was the location of the Trial of Castan XXXVI Dragonfriend, as noted by a worn-down rock carving, though the carving was clear of instructions and the sky of dragons. Confused, [Root.castanorTrialsNameIdentifier] starts to make their way around the deep ravine blocking their way.\n\nIn a sudden explosion of noise, a flock of birds dart out of the chasm. Quickly following is a young wyvern, its scales the color of burnished silver. Snapping its jaws futilely at the elusive flock, it soon catches [Root.castanorTrialsNameIdentifier]'s slack-jawed face out of the corner of its eye. With humans a relatively rare sight this far up the Trialmount, the wyvern quickly loses interest in its former quarry and instead flies over to [Root.castanorTrialsNameIdentifier], cocking its head in curiosity."

Were it not for the worn-out, clearly human-made tallies and marks carved directly in the otherwise smooth surface, the forest clearing could have passed for any other out of the hundreds of forest clearings on Trialmount, and the boulder for any other out of the thousands of boulders on the mountain. The tallies clearly marked this particular clearing as the site of the Trial of Castan II Beastbane.\n\nBeastbane was one of the most storied of Castans, with nearly the entirety of his life painstakingly recounted in dozens of murals, statues, and other pieces of art in Castonath's Pantheonway. If the chronicles are to believed, it was Beastbane who rid Escann of the centaurs and fey-infested woods and allowed human civilization to flourish, Beastbane who finally drove the remnants of the gnollish oppressors out of Cannor, and Beastbane who carried his campaign against all things beastly into Bulwar. Finally, it was Beastbane who cleaved deeper into the Salahad, through the heartland of the gnolls, and pushed his Legion into the Gates of Hell itself, sacrificing himself and his men to close the Gates of Hell forevermore.\n\nBeastbane's trial was simple in concept - hunt down a beast in the Trialmount forest, bring its carcass to the very slab of stone in this nondescript clearing, and craft something useful from the beasts remains. Luckily, [Root.castanorTrialsNameIdentifier] had come across the tracks of a young basilisk nearby, a worthy beast to fell for this trial."
