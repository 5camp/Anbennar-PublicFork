 castanortrials.101.t:0 "The Trials of Castan"
 castanortrials.101.desc1:0 "The Trials of Castan - a tradition and mode of succession unique to Castanor - was established in 618 BA. The near-mythical Castan the Progenitor, slain during the First Great Cleansing years after defeating a gnollish invasion headed by the demonic Xhazobine, left behind an interregnum period fraught with uncertainty. The able Castan Beastbane would take up the mantle of Emperor after establishing the Trials of Castan, a series of tests designed to determine a worthy successor for Castanor. Each successive Castan had to pass the Trials left behind by their predecessors, while adding their own test to the Trials at the end.\n\nThe Trials continued on for centuries, until the Sorcerer King brought Castanor crumbling down with his ambitions on the rest of Cannor. His final defeat came at the Battle of Trialmount, where a band composed of Free-Realm heroes and their elven saviors defeated the Sorcerer King. The Trials were irreparably damaged during the battle, its magic either drained, severed, or otherwise rendered useless. Or so everyone thought, at the time.\n\nTo restore Castanor, the first human empire and master of much of Cannor for centuries, our ruler must pass the Trials of Castan, as every ruler of Castanor has done in the past. Starting from the gates of the North Citadel, the traditional setting off point for the Trials, [Root.Monarch.GetName] readies [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] for what would surely be a long and arduous journey."

The marks clearly marked this particular clearing as the site of the Trial of Castan II Beastbane.\n\nBeastbane was one of the most storied of Castans, with nearly the entirety of his life painstakingly recounted in dozens of murals, statues, and other pieces of art in Castonath's Pantheonway. If the chronicles are to believed, it was Beastbane who rid Escann of the centaurs and fey-infested woods and allowed human civilization to flourish, Beastbane who finally drove the remnants of the gnollish oppressors out of Cannor, and Beastbane who carried his campaign against all things beastly into Bulwar. Finally, it was Beastbane who cleaved deeper into the Salahad, through the heartland of the gnolls, and pushed his Legion into the demonic gates leading to the gnoll homeland itself, sacrificing himself and his men to close the gates forevermore.\n\nBeastbane's trial was simple in concept - hunt down a beast in the Trialmount forest, bring its carcass to the very slab of stone in this nondescript clearing, and craft something useful from the beasts remains.

 flavor_castanor.200.desc:0 "The coronation of a new Castan, the first in centuries, was bound to raise some difficult questions for those with the greatest connection with the storied past of Castanor, the Castonath patricians. It seems that they have split into two main factions on the thorny issue.\n\nOne such faction decries [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s actions, fearing that the reestablishment of Castanor would lead to an encroachment of imperial authority upon the patricians to an extent that Castellyr and previous successor states could never have wielded. Though weak, they are rapidly gaining support among the patricians, ever worried about their own wealth and influence. Nominally, they cite the old Proclamations of Castan the Progenitor, decrying the break in traditions and legacy that they believe [Root.Monarch.GetName] committed by taking the Trials without being of clear Castanite blood.\n\nThe opposing faction is headed by the matriarch from one of the oldest patrician families, and warns against any drastic action, believing that working with the crown is in the best interest of both parties."

 flavor_castanor.204.desc1:0 "For [Root.Monarch.GetName], away from the main Castanorian court on a provincial visit, the day begins unassumingly. The sky is perhaps just a little hazier and off colour than expected, the sun just a little hungover. And was that just a hint of a smoky smell in the air? Enough to leave [Root.Monarch.GetName] on edge, perhaps, but there was work to be done that day - documents and edicts to sign, decrees and orders to give. Best to put it out of mind.\n\nUnable to shake a feeling of unease several hours later, [Root.Monarch.GetName] leaves [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] makeshift headquarters - and right into confusion and commotion. Half a dozen couriers and messengers in various states of disarray are talking over one another to one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors, the poor hapless man trying to piece the story together.\n\nWithout question, the Edhardrachon have chosen a member of their own to take the Trials of Castan, finally having the confidence to declare [Root.Monarch.GetName] a illegitimate Castan.\n\nWhat happened next has been interpreted a thousand ways by a thousand different people: some say that the Edhardrachon chosen succeeded and the Trialmount itself roared its approval, shooting ash and fire a mile high. Others say that the Trialmount rejected such a blasphemous act out of hand, filling the air with smoke to prevent the Edhardrachon chosen from sullying the Trials while the previous Castan was still alive.\n\nNo matter the truth, the Edhardrachon apparently has much more power and influence than previously thought. To support their new leader, they have quickly taken control of Castonath and are even now fortifying its formidable walls, ready to fight for every last stone. The battle lines are drawn as the people of Castanor wait with bated breath - who will end up the true heir and successor to Castan and his Empire?"

The Trials were to be restored to their original conditions, but with the added stipulation that only those who could prove themselves true descendants of the original Castanites allowed to take them. In practice, this meant that only the patricians could procure candidates, as only they had bothered to keep track throughout the centuries - exactly as they wanted.\n\nCastanor stands united once again, but for how long?

 flavor_castanor.80.desc:0 "£icon_city_of_stone£\nEntering Castonath's massive gates for the first time in thirty long years, Lianne Auern can hardly believe her eyes. This was not the Castonath she remembered, the Castonath that was her home for so many years, before she left to study and make herself known under the gnomish artificers of Anbennar and Western Cannor. Where were the squalid tenements, built over half-collapsed stone buildings? Where were the endless rows of lots more rubble than anything else, sitting as abandoned and empty as bird nests in the winter? The Castonath she knew was a child trying to fill in their older sibling's old clothes, comically out of place, its inhabitants weighed down by reminders of Castonath's past glory and splendour as they walked through too-wide streets.\n\nThis Castonath - this Castonath was brimming with an indescribable energy and verve. The sounds of construction and renovation filled the air, layering a comforting rhythm underneath the hawks of merchants and the ever-present chatter of the people of the city. More than two dozen dialects and languages provided the backdrop of this chatter, a clear sign that Castonath was attracting immigrants from across Halann. A city's lifeblood was its inhabitants, and Castonath was absorbing new ones as quickly the parched desert sand soaks up water, greedily drinking after centuries of stagnation.\n\nLianne was not here just to reminisce and gawk, though. With a more critical eye, she found what she was looking for. Here and there were what appeared to be little spiderlike, mechanical familiars, scurrying back and forth and up and down buildings and walls. As far as Lianne could tell, these autonomous devices were doing tasks as varied as delivering messages, cleaning up stray marks and animal poop, and conducting small repairs, sometimes all at once! These were work of an independent artificer union within the city - one that Lianne was tasked by the Gommo to report on. This was far from the only invention spreading through Castonath, however, in this perfect storm of Castonath renewal and explosion in magic for the people. Maybe Balgar's careful perfection of old could not be approached by mere mortals and was condemned to slowly decay over time, but perhaps artificery could bridge the gap. This was an age of new ideas, of innovation and progress. Castonath presented challenge and opportunity both - could the old City of Stone be brought into the Age of Artificery? And now that Lianne had seen all this for herself... maybe she could arrange for a longer stay in Castonath than she originally expected."

 flavor_castanor.81.desc:0 "£icon_city_of_stone£\nThe Grand Bazaar needs no introduction, as the greatest market in all Escann, and perhaps all Cannor. Since it was completed, its sprawling levels have been filled up with hundreds of stores and stalls, with spaces in its most central market coveted enough to elicit a glint in any merchant's eyes. The Grand Bazaar is once again host to goods from the world over. The smell of Raheni spices permeates the air and exotic Aelantiri birds screech their sonorous cries through the air, while other more clandestine goods can be found displayed in the darker corners of the complex, ready to be whisked away from sight at a moments notice.\n\nInformal communities have started to spring up like sprouts after a long winter, leading to the formation of different quarters in the Grand Bazaar. Halfling cooks sell their recipes to hungry workers in one such quarter, while dwarven smiths compete for customers in another. Though small at first, consisting of only the merchant and their closest families and friends, these communities are growing incredibly fast and attracting immigrants from all over, who take advantage of Castonath's many empty buildings and lots and recently cleared tenements in Lower Castonath."

 flavor_castanor.82.desc:0 "£icon_city_of_stone£\nThe Silverfall - or the Shitsfall, to many, on account of its suspiciously muddy waters and foul reek - separated Lower Castonath from the upper districts of the city, crashing down mightily in a spray of foam before winding its way under dozens of bridges as it meanders its way through Lower Castonath. Making the journey from Lower to Upper Castonath- or vice-versa, though few from the upper districts were too enthused to take that opposite route - was no small task. Travelers could walk up one of the many sets of stairs or take a rickety lift, sure, but heavier loads of goods or raw materials were bottlenecked, hampering connectivity between the lower and upper halves of the city and hindering industrial development.\n\nAnd so it was for centuries, until now! Several engineers and artificers have come forth with a plan to harness the power of the Silverfall for our own purposes. They speak of systems of lifts and pulleys to facilitate movement between Upper and Lower Castoanth, of directing the flow of the Nath itself to provide constant power for their workshops and experiments, and even of alchemical concoctions to clean up the stink and color of the river. Much of what they say is wishful fancy, of course, but their suggestions do have some practicality behind them..."

 flavor_castanor.83.t:0 "Dragonforge Steamworks"
 flavor_castanor.83.desc:0 "£icon_city_of_stone£\nWhat is the first thing one sees as they approach Castonath? The brilliantly white walls, perhaps, or maybe the sheer scale of the city as it rises up out of the ground, with the awe-inspiring Trialmount the backdrop. Approach at night however, without the clarity that the sun brings, and the city's walls are shrouded in the hazy dark. Instead, the Dragonforge draws the eye, the massive dragon's head atop the rolling hills of South Castonath lit by periodic bursts of flame from its ever-gaping maw.\n\nWhere does the intense and enduring heat needed to smelt so many tons of ore at all times of night and day come from? Perhaps only the late Balgar and his most trusted of Balgarsmiths, tasked with the upkeep of the Dragonforge throughout the centuries, knows. At least, until now! Scholars have theorized for centuries of a massive chamber of magma underneath Trialmount, the reservoir for the mountain's infrequent eruptions. Our scientists and artificers contend that a small offshoot of this chamber conveniently extends beneath Castonath - close enough for Balgar's mages to have set up long-lasting runic magic at the periphery of this arm that could transfer and provide just enough energy to run the Dragonforge.\n\nBut, why stop with the Dragonforge? Imagine the whole of South Castonath, no, the entire city of Castonath, powered for free, even if indirectly, by Halann herself? Worth experimenting with, at least, and indeed, several artificers in the city have already started doing so, probing and testing the Dragonforge's design and limits. So far, this has culminated in the development of the Dragonforge Steamworks, an impressive complex that even now feeds many workshops and homes in South Castonath with pressurized steam, using residual heat and energy from the Dragonforge in a meld of runic magic and industry."
