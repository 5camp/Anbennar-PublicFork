 grand_duchy.0.t:0 "Imperial Grand Duchy"
 grand_duchy.0.d:0 "When Anbennar was formed in 1221, three major kingdoms in its previous territory received the honor of joining the empire not as mere duchies, but as illustrious Grand Duchies: The Kingdom of the Wexonards, The Kingdom of Esmaria, and the Moonlit Kingdom of Dameria, which would become the Grand Duchies of Wex, Esmaria and Dameria respectively.\n\n These three grand duchies would be very powerful forces within the empire, having a large impact on its politics and proceedings for hundreds of years. However, with the coming of the Lilac Wars in 1348, this would start to change. During this century spanning series of conflicts, born in part from the actions of some of the grand duchies themselves, two out of the three grand duchies would be dissolved due to the discontinuation of their ruling lineages\n\nFirst, in 1365, the death of the Grand Duke of Esmaria would cause the entire region to fracture into various feuding riverlords, which would join different sides of the ongoing conflict. Second, in 1441, the deaths of Adénn Silmuna the Grand Duke of Dameria and the rest of his close family, defined the end of not just the Lilac Wars, but of the Grand Duchy of Dameria as a whole, leaving Wex as the only remaining Grand Duchy,…\n\n…until now. Through careful military and diplomatic maneuvering, one of the territories under the former grand duchies managed to unify enough of their old claim to demand the title of the former grand duchy for themselves. Now, an important question remains for the Emperor: How far should we indulge the claims of this new “Grand Duchy”?"
