 Y15_beyond_horizon_title: "Beyond the Horizon"
 Y15_beyond_horizon_desc: "''I draw north past Somyonghon\nto behold the dark green sea,\nwater spreading vast and calm.\nCraggy coastlines surge and loom,\nwooded thick with tree and brush;\nto vast grasslands stirring, lush,\nruffled by soughing autumn winds.\nBreakers rise and smash and foam—\nthe paths of both the sun and moon\nseem to spiral from those waves:\nthe luminescent Astral Sky\nseems churned within those depths.\nWhat fortune, ah! what joy,\nto be singing there my own song.''\n-Houzhao Targuun"
 Y15_vast_coast_title: "The Vast Coast"
 Y15_vast_coast_desc: "Beyond the deserts of the barbaric bird-riders lies a great expanse of forests, with a people even less organized but even less threatening. To us knowledge of their home is the first coastline frontier for us to explore on our path to discover the Federation upon the lakes."
 Y15_journeys_rest_title: "Journey's Rest"
 Y15_journeys_rest_desc: "These northern lands are wide, but not untamable. Establishing an outpost at the tip of this landmass will prove critical to establishing a proper trade route between the peoples of Zhuhan and Beikdugang. In addition, this can serve as a means to trade with the locals."
 Y15_the_horizon_title: "The Horizon"
 Y15_the_horizon_desc: "Just as we left our horizon and ventured North, we now emerge from the horizon of the Federation, the land of Zhuhan and the peoples like her. For years the Treasure Fleet has come to our ports, and now our own ships shall arrive in theirs.\n\nWhile the journey could considered a mere ride on a boat, to many it is as though we have entered an entirely different world. This world contains both new friends to trade with and horrors to behold"
 Y15_embassy_beyond_title: "Embassy from Beyond"
 Y15_embassy_beyond_desc: "The lands around the Lake Federation are swarmed with vicious Centaurs that are eager to tear down any semblance of civilization. Despite this, the peoples of the lake seek to claim these territories. As peoples who also claim descent from these lands, we ought to stake a claim for ourselves. Where they build new homes for themselves, we will build a port to reconnect them to the outside world."
 Y15_another_coast_title: "Another Coast"
 Y15_another_coast_desc: "Past the Federation, there is a population of humans in great northern forests who worship spirits within this forest. This has piqued interest from scholars who travel with the merchant fleets to study the Federation's peoples. Establishing an outpost among these people will further enable us to trade with the Federation, and provide our scholars access to this strange custom."
 Y15_cultural_ties_title: "Cultural Ties"
 Y15_cultural_ties_desc: "We have learned much from the Treasure Fleets visiting from Zhuhan, but their Federation holds peoples of other customs and other goddesses. There is much to learn from their ways of life, a civilization whose very existence is threatened by rampaging monsters deserves far more assistance, but for now we should learn of their people so that their writings will never truly be extinguished."
 Y15_goods_purse_title: "Goods to Purse Faction"
 Y15_goods_purse_desc: "The Federation has organized itself in order to better combat the centaurs that plague them. The Purse faction, the economic wing of the Federation, exists to fund the war efforts. While are not nor part of the Federation and have no obligation to contribute, sending economic aid regardless will earn us great favor from the Federation, and let them view us as their own."
 Y15_guns_sword_title: "Guns to Sword Faction"
 Y15_guns_sword_desc: "The other wing of the Federation, the Sword faction, exists to physically send soldiers into battle against the centaurs. While there is considerable distance between the centaurs and ourselves, they are ultimately a threat to all of humanity, and we owe it to our brethren on the frontlines to send men armed with guns to help them fend off this threat."
 Y15_naval_training_title: "Joint Naval Training"
 Y15_naval_training_desc: "We have traditionally already exchanged maritime knowledge with our counterparts in the Federation. However, this tradition has not kept up with the rapidly developing oceanic developments our nation is going through, and has largely relied on texts exchanged by the Treasure Fleet. Performing naval exercises directly within the Federation's waters will reignite cooperation between our two admiralities."
 Y15_haven_sea_title: "Haven on the Sea"
 Y15_haven_sea_desc: "The Federation is a lonely civilization. Being surrounded on all sides by hostile centaurs has taken a toll on their culture, and for the most part their only friend on the world stage has been us. No matter, we shall reaffirm this friendship across the entire federation so that they know they are not truly alone, and that any future diplomats representing the Federation will be welcomed freely in our courts, and assisted in contacting others."
 Y15_a_constitution_title: "A Constitution"
 Y15_a_constitution_desc: "The Federation has unified itself under an extremely meticulous document deemed their 'Constitution', establishing the guiding principles their nation shall operate under. Various forces such as the local merchants and guilds have brought forward the idea to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to follow in the footsteps of the Federation and create a similar document to guide our government. With the Federation's model to build upon, this need not be as long of a process."
 Y15_one_people_title: "One People"
 Y15_one_people_desc: "Over the years what differences there were between us and those in the Federation have significantly diminshed. Almost every merchant in the nation knows at least one of the Triunic languages, many of our citizens dress in clothes either made in the Federation or in their style. Many of our soldiers have volunteered to fight alongside them in their endless war against the Centaurs, and our coins are often used interchangably. While we may not be one nation with the Federation, we are one people, seperated only by the dark green sea and craggy coastlines."
 Y15_liberty_home_title: "Liberty at Home"
 Y15_liberty_home_desc: "The Eunuch class has ruled much of Yanshen since Harimar conquered the region centuries ago. While created with the intention of creating an administration without self-interest, it has effectively done the opposite, and placed the Yan people under a heel lacking humanity. Infiltrating one of these governments should teach us how to best topple them."
 Y15_first_dominoe_title: "The First Dominoe"
 Y15_first_dominoe_desc: "There are many proud cities under the boot of the Eunuchs, and to take them all down we must first knock one over. From this momentum the rest shall full in turn."
 Y15_fell_caste_title: "Fell the Caste"
 Y15_fell_caste_desc: "No longer shall the Yan people be ruled by a faceless class put in power by a foreign conquerer. No matter their title or nature, people should be led by one who has the interests of them and their nation at heart, rather than maintaining an elite class."
 
 
 Y15_blood_waters_title: "Blood in the Waters"
 Y15_blood_waters_desc: "Like any major city, Tianlou is supported by its countryside. Beikdugang also holds support from its countryside, but to tip the scale in our favor we must cut off Tianlou from its non-urban peoples. Sowing distruct between local administrations should provide a weak point for us to exploit."
 Y15_curious_island_title: "A Curious Island"
 Y15_curious_island_desc: "[5419.GetName] is a peculiar island, the spritual energy of the island is known across Haless, and is of particular importance to the shamanistic Bangujonsi practices. However, the island is in a key position along our desired route to the Federation, and letting that go to waste would be a pity.\nAdditionaly, the Fleet from the North has shown interest in some of the peculiar objects found on the island, with sailors even describing landing on the island to take some with them back home. Offering them for sale could prove very fruitful."
 Y15_northern_isles_title: "Northern Isles"
 Y15_northern_isles_desc: "Our journey towards the Federation has brought many wonders before us. One such excitement is the presence of two islands, utterly disconnected from the events of the world. Many of our admirality have expressed interest in controling the waters around these islands to study the sea currents and weather patterns in the northern seas. Establishing a base here would allow us to exert this control over a sea of potential."
 Y15_northern_lights_title: "Northern Lights"
 Y15_northern_lights_desc: "We have learned a lot in our time observing this northern outpost, but by far the most spectacular thing has been the great illuminations of the skies that occur almost every night, and even sometimes viewable during the day. Our mages have studied these lights intensely, and while their source is unknown, they do seem to follow understandable patterns and follow certain geometries. They have concocted a plan to make use of these lights to guide our ships sailing in the northern regions they appear in, and illuminate our path towards a brighter future."
 Y15_trade_ties_title: "Trade Ties"
 Y15_trade_ties_desc: "The Treasure Fleet has brought wealth and prsperity to Yanshen, albeit briefly due to the infrequence of their trips. More importantly, their visits brought the various ports of eastern Haless together by this mutual point of contact, fostering trade in the region. Just as they have visited all of the ports of Yanshen and beyond, we shall visit their numerous ports, and foster trade in their region."
 Y15_autumnal_isle_title: "Autumnal Isle"
 Y15_autumnal_isle_desc: "Many oddities have been seen in this eastern land, but something of particular strategic interest is a volcanic island jutting out from the sea a few days voyage from the mainland. Our basic observations haven noted that this island seems special to the natives in some fashion. We do not know much of the strange people that inhabit these lands, but they do seem to have poltiical divisions like any other group of peoples do. By introduce ourselves as a new potential ally, we can turn them against each other to serve our interest of claiming this island, and even learn about it in the process."
 Y15_volcanic_base_title: "Volcanic Base"
 Y15_volcanic_base_desc: "The natives speak highly of this volcanic island, and we have learned much from them. The 'Eordan' people each worship various seasonal forces, while some directly worship 'fey' forces located in a magnficiant forest centrally located in the region. The season of worship varies between these peoples and is a great source of division we can explioit. The island we seek is currently in control of Autunmal forces. So long as we are respectful towards at least some of these factions, there are many willing to look the other way as we sail in and claim the sparkling jewel of their seas."
 Y15_market_relics_title: "New Market for Relics"
 Y15_market_relics_desc: "The Lake Federation is our greatest trade partner, and it is no surprise that merchants there are interested in the various relics we have encountered in Aelantir. There is considerable room for profit by establishing a trade route specficially for these relics to them, and we are happy to answer the call. It is only a matter of ensuring enough sources of them to meet the demand."
 Y15_trade_privledges_title: "Trade Privileges"
 Y15_trade_privledges_desc: "As we begin to supplant the legendary Treasure Fleet as the main link between the Federation and the outside world, ensuring a steady flow of goods is important. Enabling this will take investment in our ports and a trade fleet up to the task."
 Y15_disrupt_piracy_title: "Disrupt Piracy"
 Y15_disrupt_piracy_desc: "For generations the Treasure Fleet has been plagued by pirates swarming in the Ringlet Sea to our south. The Fleet is equipped fairly well but does not have the logistics necessary to deal with those organized under the banner of Pinghoi. We owe it to our friends to relieve them of this issue."
 Y15_artery_trade_title: "Artery of Trade"
 Y15_artery_trade_desc: "As international trade continues to expand, a developing trade route has been towards Sarhal in the south. The Ringlet Isles, situated directly between us and that continent, would make a perfect position to capitalize on this development and ensure our northern route is not outdone."
 Y15_TBD_title: "Exotic Seas"
 Y15_TBD_desc: "§RThis section will be expanded upon in both the Sarhal and Insyaa updates.§!"
 
 
 Y15_sea_land_title: "By Sea and Land"
 Y15_sea_land_desc: "Tianlou, widely considered the 'Jewel of Yanshen' due to its advantageous position alonge the Yanjiang river, has been a bitter rival to our mercantile interests for centuries. Even in the days of elven invasion we were happy to cooperate with Jaher towards the end of seeing Tianlou besieged and conquered. While they have enjoyed the fruits of mere positioning, Beikdugang has toiled to develop herself as a worthy counterpart, but to frustratingly futile results.\n\nThere is no other path forward. If Beikdugang is to truly rise, Tianlou must fall. The first step on this path is to prepare our forces on both land and sea, for to triumph over only one will not earn us true victory over Tianlou."
 Y15_stand_stronger_title: "Stand Stronger"
 Y15_stand_stronger_desc: "The showdown between us and Tianlou will be quick and decisive, a battle between two ports. Like any negotiation, the one who leverages greater resources has the advantage. When the fight begins, holding the stronger footing may prove key to victory."
 Y15_incoming_wave_title: "Incoming Wave"
 Y15_incoming_wave_desc: "The Gate of Smoke is quite well defended, a natural response to being the target of invasion by major empires. While larger forces are not always needed to win a battle, it certainly helps to hold more cards to play in your hand."
 Y15_river_gate_title: "Claim the River Gate"
 Y15_river_gate_desc: "The time has come, like a rapid tsunami approaching land, our forces shall overwhelm and crush our sworn enemies in Tianlou. When the waters withdraw, the landscape will come out altered in favor of Beikdugang. While the city of the river descends, the city of the seas shall rise triumphant."
 Y15_rival_vanquished_title: "A Rival Vanquished"
 Y15_rival_vanquished_desc: "At long last, our flag rises alongside the famed Towers of the Sky. With their military forces scattered the time has come to assert our authority over the citizenry and ensure they know the days of Tianlou being a capital are over. Great conquerers have paid the price for mishandling this city, but we are no conquerers, we are liberators. We have liberated Yanshen from the idea that this one city is meant to rule over them all."
 Y15_set_sail_title: "Set Sail"
 Y15_set_sail_desc: "Tianlou, our greatest threat on our home shores, has been defeated. A mighty fleet has been risen to project our might. In foreign northern waters the guiding lights shine, calling us to further seas. The time is ripe for us to set sail to the great beyond, to whatever lies on the far side of the eternal storm. Someday that mystery may be solved, but for now mysteries yet to be known call to us across the waters."
 Y15_seasonal_winds_title: "Seasonal Winds"
 Y15_seasonal_winds_desc: "As the Northern Lights guide us further east, we've begun to notice strage effects in the winds. They seem to call to mind inappropoiate seasons, with even the occasional summer breeze felt with icebergs in sight. Whatever the cause of this, it is surely worth exploring."
 Y15_starry_beaches_title: "Starry Beaches"
 Y15_starry_beaches_desc: "The comparatively disparate 'Fograc' peoples seem connected to the season worshippers to their north, but instead seek guidance from the stars. Their knowledge of the stars could prove useful for navigation around here, where our own records are brand new and hardly usable. Additionally, their hilly cliffs bear resemblance to those surrounding Beikdugang, and would make an excellent staging ground to claim the greater prizes in the north."
 Y15_solstice_title: "Solstice"
 Y15_solstice_desc: "Summer and Winter, Spring and Autumn. This debate rages across the entirety of Eordand, and yet to the outside world this strife is meaningless. In the midst of this battlefield lie what seem to be powerful relics of a by-gone age, put to waste by those too blinded by war and other forces. By establishing ourselves on all sides of this conflict we shall show them that at least some of them can co-exist with each other, and all the while sieze these wonderous items for ourselves, for undoubtedly there will be many interested in filling our coffers for them."
 Y15_gateway_aelantir_title: "Gateway to Aelantir"
 Y15_gateway_aelantir_desc: "Many oddities have been found in our journey following the lights, and the promise of wealth and adventure has risen us among the greatest powers in Haless. Capitalizing on this opportunity will necessiate a grand port to bring these exotic goods of the strange lands to our lands. No ordinary port will do, however. If we wish to truly capture the hearts and spirits of those who visit Beikdugang, we must offer them more than wares. A glorious lightshow comparable to our northern outpost should be on display for visitors to behold, so that all may understand that this port has no equal."
 Y15_port_haless_title: "Port of Haless"
 Y15_port_haless_desc: "Wealth begets wealth, and nowhere in Haless is greater wealth found than in the ports of Beikdugang. Gone are the days when the Jewel of Yanshen was Tianlou, for a new jewel has emerged from the rough. Now Beikdugang stands as the jewel of not only Yanshen, but all of Haless."
 Y15_yanshen_route_title: "Yanshen Trade Route"
 Y15_yanshen_route_desc: "Yanshen, with its relative wealth, prosperity, and abundant ports, it the primary target of commerce for the Treasure Fleet. However, with our rise to prominence there is little need for them to waste their time making dealings with our neighbors when we are happy to offer fair deals to our close friends from the Federation. If we can seccure the major trade posts on the rest of coastal Yanshen, we can offer the Treasure Fleet all that Yanshen brings to the table."
 Y15_southern_ports_title: "Southern Ports"
 Y15_southern_ports_desc: "The lands south of the Phokhao Range hold less wealth than what is found in Yanshen but its exotic goods, such as those of Dwarven make, still prove an enticing purchase for the Treasure Fleet. Gaining access to this market will allow us to offer these exotic goods to our counterparts from the Federation, and cut out the unnecessary middleman."
 Y15_expand_route_title: "Expand the Route"
 Y15_expand_route_desc: "As ship building practices improve, the potential range the Treasure Fleet can reach has improved. Significant interest in Rahen has developed in the Federation, and the Treasure Fleet is preparing to sail around the Lupulan Rainforest and visit their ports. We should do reconnaissance on their behalf and locate the best ports for them to visit."
 Y15_shine_across_title: "Shine Across All Seas"
 Y15_shine_across_desc: "For most, the ocean is a cold and dark place. They pray for safe passage as they cross what they view as a necessary evil for swift travel. For [Root.GetName], the sea is our home. Its brilliant hues call our people to all corners of the world, the mesmerizing northern lights draw our hearts to the cold waters most avoid, the sprinkling stars of the astral wonderously viewed with no settlements to obscure them. Most people work to develop their sea legs, but for us the more frequent problem is our land legs. The glory of the lights is ours to bring to the entire world, and the sea is our vehicle."
 Y15_window_world_title: "Window to the World"
 Y15_window_world_desc: "In the Federation's history of isolation, we have been their means of learning about the outside world. Likewise, we have been the outside worlds means of learning about the Federation, and this has created demand for the goods produced within the Federation. Soldifiying our trade route across the entire northern sea will allow us to profit heavily from shipping Federation goods to Cannor and Cannorian technologies to the Federation."

 Y15_friends_shore_title: "Friends on the Shore"
 Y15_friends_shore_desc: "While Tianlou is our enemy, there is no reason for us to be their only enemy. Making friendly negotiations with our neighbors, or even offers of better treatment of ships through the Gate of Smoke will rally support behind our quest to set Tianlou aflame."
 Y15_worthy_harbor_title: "Worthy Harbor"
 Y15_worthy_harbor_desc: "If we wish to expand the naval capacity of our nation to extent our reach across the seas, we must develop the naval infrastructure of Beikdugang's port.\nThis will also enable peoples from across Haless to move to Beikdugang, such as a distinguished Harimari, whose presence is often indicative of a proper state."
 Y15_room_fleet_title: "Room for a Fleet"
 Y15_room_fleet_desc: "While Beikdugang now provides ample room for trade ships to bring goods in, there must also be room for military vessels so that we may guarentee safe passage for our trade ships. Thankfully, we have plenty of coastline with which to develop more ports to maintain both a trade fleet and a war fleet."
 Y15_pride_east_title: "Pride of the East"
 Y15_pride_east_desc: "As the reach of our ships extends, so to must our means of battle. Building ocean faring war vessels will prove critical in our voyages across the seas. Not only do they provide cannons to bombard any hostile force we may encounter, but the sheer magnificance of them will help us impose our will."
 Y15_buffer_north_title: "Buffer in the North"
 Y15_buffer_north_desc: "It is foolish to not recognize ones weaknesses, and ours is on land. [Y16.GetName], on the other hand, has become well accostumed to fending off the marauding [shuvuush.GetName] from the north. Bringing them into our growing network and granting them the position of being our northern flank will let us focus on our strengths upon the seas."
 Y15_northeast_passage_title: "Northeast Passage"
 Y15_northeast_passage_desc: "The eastern seas seem to be without end, however the journey has become more difficult due to glaciers and intermittent frozen areas. Establishing ourselves on the edge of this frozen sea will enable us to take time to properly chart a course through this terrain. The shining northern lights give promise of a brilliant future, and this obstacle will not dishearten us."
 Y15_the_flamekeepers_title: "The Flamekeepers"
 Y15_the_flamekeepers_desc: "When faced with an obstacle too difficult to circumvent, sometimes the solution is to go through. That is the mindset of some of the mages that have been studying the northern lights and glaciers of this sea of glaciers. They have developed simplistic spells usable on and around ships to help them push through the glaciers, the most basic being just using fire magic to melt said glaciers. It's a tad crude, but it gets the job done. The glaciers reflect the great lights magnificently, and now we have the means to place ourselves in their midst."
 Y15_ship_production_title: "Mass Ship Production"
 Y15_ship_production_desc: "We have amassed great wealth, but are still vulnerable to potentially hostile powers around us. Being able to fend off any would-be usuper of our trade routes is vital to maintaining our grasp on them. Let us build an uncontestable fleet, so that all others know that the coasts of Haless are ours to control."
 Y15_mend_link_title: "Mend the Weak Link"
 Y15_mend_link_desc: "The people of Odheongun have been relatively unreceptive to trade since their Sewengun Period, but their positioning along our trade route to the Federation demands they let themselves be open for commerce. Their Bateobugi ships are formidable, but our navy is up to the task of cracking them."
 Y15_merchant_marines_title: "Merchant Marines"
 Y15_merchant_marines_desc: "Our armies have fought more battles at sea than upon land. With our focus being on maritime affairs it is rare that we need to take up arms in our mainland holdings. Dedicating our forces signficantly to this focus will prove well to our benefit, while ensuring that even our sailors are trained in military affairs that may occur on land."
 Y15_impress_remnants_title: "Impress the Remnants"
 Y15_impress_remnants_desc: "Elves have carried a bad reputation in and around our homeland since the invasion of Jaher centuries ago, but those among them who live fully at sea are worth our attention. They hold a maritime legacy extending all the way to the fall of Aelantir's Precursor civilization, giving them experience that even our own sailors can envy. Demonstrating our naval capabiltiies and the skills of our leadership at sea should convince them of the merits of cooperation."

 Y15_beikdugang_rebirth_title: "Beikdugang Rebirth"
 Y15_beikdugang_rebirth_desc: "Many things travel by sea. Most think of goods and people, but ideas are also an important cargo carried by all ships. The great Fleet from the North is always delighted to exchange writings and tales with those it encounters, and they are but one source of knowledge we have access to. To shape our society to the ideas of all we encounter is to make ourselves like water, always shifting, and in this way our nation will be reborn as the greatest hub of ideas in Haless."
 Y15_ideas_sea_title: "Ideas of the Sea"
 Y15_ideas_sea_desc: "The collection of works around Haless, from the Kelino people in the South to the Odheongun in the North to the people of the Fleet beyond the horizon, lets the Violet Dawn shine upon her coastlines. The future of Beikdugang is bright, waiting only for us to lead it."
 Y15_trade_knowledge_title: "Trade of Knowledge"
 Y15_trade_knowledge_desc: "Just as knowledge has been collected to us, it shall be spread out from us. The tree of knowledge planted within this nation has borne fruit at long last, and sharing this fruit of labor shall provide us an opportunity to profit."
 Y15_goods_ships_title: "Goods for Ships"
 Y15_goods_ships_desc: "Many ships now come to Beikdugang in search of knowledge and foreign goods, however goods originating from the city itself are lacking. We have established ourselves well as a middleman for commerce, but to truly take advantage of our position we must also be a producer for commerce."
 Y15_control_flow_title: "Control the Flow"
 Y15_control_flow_desc: "The ports of lower Yanshen carry a lot of wealth through them. Control over more of these ports gives us acces to that wealth, and with that money government services and armies can be funded. This self-fufilling cycle will either be our path to glory or the nature of our destruction. We must ensure it is the former."
 Y15_coastline_dominance_title: "Coastline Dominance"
 Y15_coastline_dominance_desc: "The cycle of wealth and power continues, and should be pushed further. Expanding the coastline of our nation in both directions will ensure the security of Beikdugang proper. While the rugged hills of the shores around us make for less ideal cities, they make far more useful defensive positions."
 Y15_properity_south_title: "Prosperity in the South"
 Y15_properity_south_desc: "Our position at the edge of Haless has helped us peacefully exist as traders for some time. Others in our periphery, however, have not been so lucky. By extending our reach further inland, we may allow this interior the same prosperity we have been able to maintain."
 Y15_acquire_hardwoods_title: "Acquire Hardwoods"
 Y15_acquire_hardwoods_desc: "Almost every aspect of maritime life depends on a steady supply of lumber. Fortunately for us, the coastal region between us and the Federation is full of strong trees waiting to be cut down and put to use in our navy. Ensuring this resource is controlled by our merchants and used for our ships will allow us to develop more ships and ports."
 Y15_build_arsenal_title: "Build the Arsenal"
 Y15_build_arsenal_desc: "With the materials to build plenty of ships, the question is to have a location to build them. One cannot construct a ship upon any body of water, it requires a variety of instruments and materials available to prepare the finer work of an ocean-going vessel. Consoldiating the means of production into one location will enable us to build an entire fleet from once natural resources in one fell swoop.\nPlacing this majestic arsenal in the hills of [4908.GetName] will allow for a safer location further from civilian ports."
 Y15_push_east_title: "Push East"
 Y15_push_east_desc: "There is now nothing between us and what lies east of the reflecting glaciers except our own will. Let the Flamekeepers keep our bodies and hearts warm as we venture forth beyond the glittering ice. For those who turn back either out of cowardice or to report to the homeland officials, they will bring with them tales of the entities that lurk in this inhospitable terrain."
 Y15_thaw_title: "Thaw"
 Y15_thaw_desc: "As we emerge from the seemingly endless glacial ice, one of the first things we see is other ships, comparable to our own in magnificance but clearly foreign. It is here, below the fringes of the great lights, that first contact is made with people from Cannor. These lands were once spoken of by elves by their brief occupation of Haless, but this is the first knowledge gleaned of this distant land experienced firsthand. Here, at the roof of the world, the ice begins to thaw between two different worlds, and reaching this land for ourself is only one more voyage away."
 Y15_knowledge_exchange_title: "Knowledge Exchange"
 Y15_knowledge_exchange_desc: "These Cannorians offer a different perspective on many topics. The presence of spirits in their lands is unnoticed if present at all. Many of them hold dynasties in higher regard, and there is much strife over the gods they do worship. Despite all of this, they hold technological developments considered impressive by our standards, and the intermingling of the present races creates very interesting dynamics. We would benefit from learning from them, and along the way we could tech them some things as well."
 Y15_modernize_nanxin_title: "Modernize Nanxin"

While many had heard stories from the Treasure Fleet about our way of life, many nonetheless clamored to hear of our spriritual practices, to which have likened to the Kukatodic people to their North.\n\nHouzhao Targuun, now beginning to reach his middle age, has decided to retire from his service in the navy.

 flavor_beikdugang.3.t: "Houzhao Targuun"
 flavor_beikdugang.3.d: "Even as a young boy, Houzhao Targuun was a common sight when the Zhuhan Fleet came to our ports. The son of admiralty, he always had a fascination with the sea and what went across it. He spent days on end asking the merchants of their legendary homeland, hearing folklore of their goddesses and tales of frightening human-horse hybrids. When they set sail he had spoken to every last person on every ship at least once.\n\nBy the time of the Fleet's next visit, Houzhao was a teenager, and by this point had made a point of tracing his lineage back to the forefathers from Zhuhan (or Zurkanrek as they called it), and could even hold a conversation in their native tongue, albeit with some difficulty. While his child-like wonder for their homeland had diminshed, he was nonetheless enthusiastic to spend his days in the markets with them, only to join them in dining among the merchants and admirals that comprise the upper echelon of Beikdugang. When the Fleet left for other shores, it took consdierable effort to convince him to not abandon his life here and join them. After their departure, Houzhao spent several nights on the balcony of his family's estate looking out to the sea, being roused only by the realization that by following his family's footsteps and becoming an admiral himself he could sail alongside the foreign fleet that had captured his heart.\n\nBy the time of the Fleet's third visit in his lifetime, Houzhao had graduated from his studies at Nanxin Naval Academy unparalled in his knowedge of all things nautical. While many of those he spoke to as a child had retired from the fleet, those who knew him were astonsihed by his immaculate knowladge of the weather patterns and and the very sea creatures that could be eaten along their route in the event of emergency, several of which they did not know themselves. Those who did not know him thought he was the very [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Beikdugang due to the level of formality to which he presented himself to them, and the banquet he hosted in their honor. When Houzhao, now Admiral Targuun, offered to muster a few ships and escort the Tarde Fleet for the rest of their time along the Eastern Halessi coasts, they were delighted to let the flag of Beikdugang fly alongside that of the Rising Sun. Over half a year later he would return to his home port, sated for the time being but nonetheless determined in his life's quest to sail to their port himself.\n\nThis vision of his is a catalyst for a greater destiny for Beikdugang, one that sees the flag of the Violet Dawn in ports that cannot even be concieved in the minds of those in the era he lives in. This destiny calls to us, much like how the sea calls to her sailors. Our path is to answer this call, and venture forth to the endless seas."
