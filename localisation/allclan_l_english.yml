 allclan.10.t:0 "Council Debate: How to Move the Orcs to the New Farms."
 allclan.10.d:0 "The Nezkaru council has called a special assembly to deal with the newest item of policy. It is a remarkably calm one, with only two bombings and a poisoning that have disturbed the proceedings so far. The issue currently under debate in the council is that of the orcs, specifically how best to move them to the new farms we have prepared.\n\nThe debate, as it always does, has coalesced into three policies supported by one of the major political factions.\n\nThe Zukovinkraty position is that the process offers an excellent opportunity to test the latest inventions and give our military some practice. Their plan might take longer, but offers to make the enterprise serve a dual prupose.\n\nThe Fubaristi plan is to simply force the orcs to move the old fashioned way. They claim it will be both swift, cheap, and nationally important to allow the goblin masses to push the orcs out as a united effort. No doubt a ploy to win themselves some influence with some of the easier fooled masses, but a workable and likely swift suggestion.\n\nFinally, the Kartelklanovi see this as another opportunity to make money. They claim that the council can encourage various cartels to put their own money into the whole affair by offering farm production futures and land allotments to goblins for sale, meaning more money all around. The hidden impact of their plan is that we will likely make more money selling them once the orcish labor is in place, but the impact might not be so much."
