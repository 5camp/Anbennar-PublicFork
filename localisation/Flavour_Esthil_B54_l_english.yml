 flavor_esthil.2.t:0 "An Ambitious Plan"
 flavor_esthil.2.d:0 "Caranec, the first lich. While the name might strike fear or anger into some, for Varina, it held neither. A certain amount of healthy respect, of course, but in truth, she would have loved to have met the man in his time. \n\n Instead, she has settled for reading his works. Copied by the furtive hands of acolytes and poseurs who wished to emulate him or keep his knowledge in circulation, pages and documents written by the man have survived in secret places. But while the collection she holds in her hands now is great, perhaps greater then any before, they are not enough. Key text are missing, and the only place in the world they might rest is in the hands of the Orda Aldresia who defeated the first lich so long ago. \n\n The only way forward is to take what they have locked away."
 flavor_esthil.2.a:0 "It shall be done."

 flavor_esthil.3.t:0 "The Question of Agents"
 flavor_esthil.3.d:0 "Directly attacking the Orda Aldresia is out of the question, so the only other reasonable solution is to take by stealth what cannot be taken by force. To that end, Varina considers her options carefully. A single professional thief could get the job done, but would be expensive. Some of the locals of the Ordas' territory may be bribable, and that would be cheap, but how effective could they be? /n/n Another possiblity is the use of not one professional, but a band of them. Such a group would almost certainly be able to finish the job, but would be much more expensive. /n/n Of course, Varina could always put her trust in her magical skills."
 flavor_esthil.3.a:0 "Let us hire a true professional. A master thief."
 flavor_esthil.3.b:0 "A group of local thugs will do. The Order doesn't rule well."
 flavor_esthil.3.c:0 "Only the best of best will do. Where one thief might fail, five shall not."
 flavor_esthil.3.d:0 "Only the best of best will do...Luckily I have just the spell!" 

 flavor_esthil.4.t:0 "A Way In"
 flavor_esthil.4.d:0 "With the choice made, the agents must come up with a plan to get through the front door of the fortress-monastery; this is made more difficult that the Orda Aldreis is designed, by its very nature, to be paranoid of people attempting just what Varina is. Every armor has a weakpoint, however /n/n The most straight forward solution would be to try and breach the monastery by night. If succesful, perhaps no one would ever know they were there at all. /n/n A less parsimonious action might be to simply bribe the custodian in charge of the vault. A small fortune for the man should make him forget any vows he had, especially if we are vague about why exactly we want to get in. The Order has become infamous for corruption, but even that goes only so far." /n/n Where stealth and bribery may fail, guile may win out. Esthil is a legitimate state, after all, and such states often send out diplomat missions; most diplomats double as spies, and everyone does it anyway. A delegation sent under the guise of official business could easily be left to their own devices for a few hours..."
 flavor_esthil.4.a:0 "Let none know you were there; sneak in at nightfall."
 flavor_esthil.4.b:0 "We shall bribe the Order custodians. All things glitter."
 flavor_esthil.4.c:0 "Perhaps a disguise would be best. Ready the documents!"

 flavor_esthil.5.t:0 "The Vault"
 flavor_esthil.5.d:0 "The Vault is no mere room for storage; instead it is a complex of individual cells and storage areas, meant to contain a mixture of magical items, both the rare and highly dangerous. Individual cells can themselves be a complex, and Varina's agents find themselves faced a labyrthian maze made all the more dangerous by traps. /n/n The only way forward is through the traps; Several solutions offer themselves, but only three allow for speed. Setting off the traps from a safe vantage point might do it, but could be very loud and potentially fatal. Disabling or moving through them safely must be an option, or else the Orda could not check on their charges; and at first glance, there are many artifacts magical in nature that could very well disable, or at least nullify, the traps."
 flavor_esthil.5.a:0 "Discharge them - hopefully this wont be too loud."
 flavor_esthil.5.b:0 "No system is perfect; they can find a way through, silently."
 flavor_esthil.5.c:0 "Perhaps we can use on of the other stored items to get rid of the traps?"

 flavor_esthil.6.t:0 "In Our Grasp"
 flavor_esthil.6.d:0 "The final lock is as mundane as could be. Complex, but mundane. Near silence fills the otherwise empty vault as clothed hands carefully manipulate tumblers until, with a soft click, the lock releases. /n/n Inside the box, so carefully warded and protected, is a plain looking leather journal. To the eyes of the agents it would be as indiscernable as any other tome. Now they simply needed to extract the item they were hired to, hopefully without being found out."
 flavor_esthil.6.a:0 "It is ours, and with it, knowledge"
 flavor_esthil.6.b:0 "Our getaway was not as clean as we had hoped; the world trembles in anger and fear"

 flavor_esthil.7.t:0 "The Assembly"
 flavor_esthil.7.d:0 "At long last, the Iron Scepter has achieved its goals; through conquest, diplomacy, and adventuring, the ragged band of former magisters, adventurers, and explorers is now in position to stake a claim, not merely as a company, but as a country. Houses replace tents; warcamps become forts; and forage land becomes farmland. \n\n With their end goal clearly in sight, a great assembly is called of various influential company members, captains, explorers, magisters, and settler-folk; with no less a goal then the establishing of a new Escanni nation. One of the first, but most important decisions, is who will lead them in the coming years."
 flavor_esthil.7.a:0 "Let us hope for a swift decision."

 flavor_esthil.8.t:0 "The Deadlock"
 flavor_esthil.8.d:0 "After days of arguments, negotiations, votes, and decisions, it all ends in a deadlock. \n\n On one side sits Ardor. An old hand in the company, and a former professor from the Magisterium, he is well known amongst the veterans and seems to have the vote of many of the more conservative elements of the company. The Iron Scepter has flourished under men like him, and many members who have served along side him spread talk of the celebrations that were held after victories. His opponents vary in opinion, from those who simply find him too conservative, to those who dislike his tendency to meddle and enter choleric tempers, while some of the older members of the company recall the rumors of abuse of his substantial skill in enchantment. \n\n On the other sits Varina. A relative newcomer to the company, she has nonetheless shown competence in leadership and strategy. While many of the more conservative members of the Iron Scepter remain ill at ease with her methods, her ability cannot be denied. A necromancer of exceptional talent, her actions on the field have led to more than one victory. She is ruthless to her enemies, and holds a burning hatred of the orcs occupying the land, which is no penalty amongst the Iron Scepter. Her base are largely the young, the radical, and those truly seeking to break the chains that held magic back for so long. Had her mindset been allowed, they argue, perhaps the Greentide would have failed." \n\n With a hush, the final voter raises their voice, and calls out for..."
 flavor_esthil.8.a:0 "Ardor - The wisdom of age and experience shall guide us! §R(Currently not in)§"
 flavor_esthil.8.b:0 "Varina - We are entering a new age, and require new ideas to see us through."

 flavor_esthil.9.t:0 "A New Dawn"
 flavor_esthil.9.d:0 "After the initial cheering is done (for even most of those who voted against her in the last round still respected her), Varina rises gracefully and takes her place at the center of the assembly. A hush falls over the crowd as the young woman begins to speak, her voice distant, but full of conviction \n\n 'My people. I have my thanks to give, but most of all, I swear on this day you have chosen the path of strength. Too long have our minds been shackled to the old world; shackled to ideas about how strength should be used, and where strength should come from. About what is right, and what is wrong' \n\n 'My people, I stand before you today to tell you that what is right is not merely surviving, but thriving. From the ashes of the old world shall arise a new order, one that I will build, with your help, and soon we shall all reap the rewards of it; I pledge to you that before my time is done, this new nation shall be a nation of abundance.' \n\n 'My people, from this day forth know that no orc shall threaten us, no goblin take our children for their stewpot; no mother be driven from her home with only her clothes and her child; no soldier dying for some corrupt noble fleeing with his wealth; no farmer starving while the wealthy grow fat.' \n\n 'Let us begin our great works, and claim what is rightfully ours by our strength!'"
 flavor_esthil.9.a:0 "Long Live Varina!"

 flavor_esthil.12.k:0 "On the other hand, we don't need to move today."

 flavor_esthil.13.t:0 "A Shadow Upon the Vale"
 flavor_esthil.13.d:0 "The people of Marrhold have been long used to the long shadows of the morning light; as the sun rises in the east, the great mountains block its rays, and the valleys and the dales fill with light as if by pouring. But today, a shadow is cast from the west, as the sun sets.\n\n With the setting sun behind it it, the people of Marrhold look up, and see the magnificence of Morgurax, it's shadow piercing across the valleys towards the entrance to mountain itself. The Archmage had arrived.\n\n Below her gaze, valleys laid out like the claws of some vast beast zigzagged back and forth, rising up to the great mountain entrance of the conquered peoples home hold. Griffon riders were already in the air to receive her, ready to receive their new ruler and her entourage."
 flavor_esthil.13.a:0 "I am sick of the cold already."

 flavor_esthil.14.t:0 "A Shadow Upon the Blade"
 flavor_esthil.14.d:0 "Past the dark tower of Estíl, Morgurax moved as languidly as the river that flowed through Bladeskeep. The former capital of one of the great hegemons of Escann once again fell in shadow, this time from the floating necropolis, and beneath the gaze of the Archmage it seemed as a whispering shadow compared to the grandeur of the palace, no matter how the restoration was proceeding.\n\n The people of Bladeskeep could but look up and know that their future was assured by the Archmage, who had bought safety, security, and order. In the shadow of the palace, they were reminded of their new place in history."
 flavor_esthil.14.a:0 "I wonder where the sword went."

 flavor_esthil.15.t:0 "A Shadow Upon the Road"
 flavor_esthil.15.d:0 "The sentries at the entrace to Khugdir had perhaps the greatest view of the magnificent necropolis in the world; high above the hills below, above the Khugsroad, the floating palace could be seen coming around the curve of the land below, as a dark haze at first, then solidifying into well polished black stone.\n\n Never again would the realm be threatened by monsters pouring forth from the dark 'neath the world, the Archmage had promised, and so they would not. For here at the Khrugsroad they could watch and see and stare into the darkness; and they would make sure that the darkness blinked first."
 flavor_esthil.15.a:0 "I can see my house from here!" 

 flavor_esthil.16.t:0 "A Shadow Upon the Tournament"
 flavor_esthil.16.d:0 "With the arrival of the necropolis at the tourney grounds, one could observe in glance something men of letters had long sought to capture. Below, the once proud staging ground for the ancient tourneys, a noble and glorious tradition long since past its necessity or use, and one some say condemned Escann to death. Above, the grand necropolis and palace of the Archmage of Esthil, which had promised and built a brighter, safer future for the people of the empire, using its might to ensure it.\n\n For the Archmage, the ancient city below represented the weakness of the old world; arguments had been made to raze it to the ground. But throwing away such infrastructure was wasteful, and the people still craved entertainment. But never again would the land suffer the vanity of fools holding jousting matches, where strength must instead prevail."
 flavor_esthil.16.a:0 "Pompous fools." 

 flavor_esthil.17.t:0 "A Shadow Upon the Ironworks"
 flavor_esthil.17.d:0 "Even floating above the vast ironworks of the south, the noise of the forges ringing was audible. As the hungry Deadmines to the north churned out ore at rates beyond mortal capacity, so to did the forges of the south thirst for it, and the ancient ironworks of Vernham were no different. The shadow cast by the grand necropolis was hardly noticed by the denizens of the ironworks, being only a slightly darker shade of black to those who dwelt beneath the endless smoke.\n\n Winged servants of necrotic flesh swooped and swept the outside of the palace, making sure the dark stone remained polish even in the onslaught of smoke, with their controllers having little hope of success; and nothing could cover the sound of the hammers below."
 flavor_esthil.17.a:0 "This place is too loud." 

 flavor_esthil.18.t:0 "A Shadow Upon the Lake"
 flavor_esthil.18.d:0 "The undead workers, moving mechanically, did not even glance up as the sun disappeared in the midst of their day. Their controllers, however, did, as did the few agricultural experts who advised them. Floating serenely, peacefully, the great palace of the Archmage made its way towards the lakes edge, and the great silos that held the bounty of their harvest. Necromancer and expert alike removed their hats respectfully, a silent tribute to the being who had ensured that never again would their families face hunger.\n\n High above, the Archmage had to admire the beauty of the land transformed to the use of man. For miles, as far as the eye could see, were well laid out irrigation ditches and farmland and roads, with the port city at the head. Carts flowed in and out, and ships with high mast carried the precious cargo across the lake to other ports. Their was always an irony in such life flourishing at the hands of the dead."
 flavor_esthil.18.a:0 "It's growing nicely." 
 #Decision
 B54_move_morgurax_title:0 "Move Morgurax"
 B54_move_morgurax_desc:0 "Morgurax is a floating citadel, and does not need to sit in one place if the Archmage so desires. It is possible to move the great palace around the Empire, so the Archmage may personally overseer the land."

 flavor_esthil.19.t:0 "Theft within the Vaults"
 flavor_esthil.19.d:0 "The Custodian of the Vaults went about his grim business, his underlings bringing him a steady string of reports from the vault beneath as they checked the security systems. Someone had broken through, and now came the audit, to find what was taken.\n\n With a falling silence echoing up the corridor, the custodian looked up to see one of the young members of the order, his face drained of all blood. The Custodian looked at him, then down at the great ledger, his hand trembling as he traced his finger down to the one unaccounted for item.\n\n The History of the Undead, the personal research notes of Caranec, First Lich, was gone."
 flavor_esthil.19.a:0 "We must prepare for the worse."
