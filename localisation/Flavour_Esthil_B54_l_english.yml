 B54_palace_in_the_skies_desc:0 "With the foundations laid, it has been realized that merely sitting upon the edge of one city is not enough; should a ruler not look after all their people?

 B54_finishing_touches_title:0 "Finishing Touches"
 B54_finishing_touches_desc:0 "Floating majestically, Morgurax now dominates the skyline for miles around.
