 magic_estate.3.t:0 "Host Magical Feast"
 magic_estate.3.d:0 "The basic test of journeyman conjuration is looking at images and summoning a magical copy of it, essentially creating a duplicate.\n\nMasters however, can created entire rooms and decorations with their mind and imagination, making the most fantastical ideas true and possible for the short time the conjuration spell lasts."

 magic_estate.4.t:0 "Encourage Plant Growth"
 magic_estate.4.d:0 "Apprentice mages learn life-related transmutation magics but experimenting on plants, which is agreed to be a much safer way to teach the consequences of failing to alter living things rather than using animals or people.\n\nA more talented mage can use this rudimentary skill set to encourage growth in plant life, creating healthier, faster and even tastier crops and food."

 magic_estate.5.d:0 "Scrying is the act of looking through a medium (usually a crystal ball) to see far-away events or even foretelling the future. It is the foundation of most divination spells, and in this case refers to the base-level spell of seeing events happening elsewhere during the present.\n\nScrying is most effective when given as a recurring task for a group of mages, as it allows a larger area to be watched at all times, in addition to a greater support network.\n\n§B(The mana cost for this spell will increase depending on the size of the target countries)§!"

 magic_estate.7.t:0 "Empower Wards"
 magic_estate.7.d:0 "Defensive Wards can come in all shapes and fashions, from enhancing the resistance of objects such as walls, creating magic shield and barriers to glyphs and runes acting as traps.\n\nMost contemporary castles had some sort of ward, at least to protect them from low-level magic attacks like fireballs or magic missiles, and was the source of steady work for many beginner mages."
 magic_estate.8.t:0 "Rite of Conception"
 magic_estate.8.d:0 "The Rite of Conception is in-fact a series of magical spells and concoctions combined to increase the chances of having a magically-gifted child.
