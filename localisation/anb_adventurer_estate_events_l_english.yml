 adventurers_estate_events.1.d:0 "The status of the $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$ does not rest on the priviliges of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or the // of $ESTATE_CHURCH$ or the wealth of $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. Instead they have had to make their own fortunes by bravery and fighting skill. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. While not as prestigious business is in many ways the backbone of our economy and through their control over the means of production the $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$ have managed to increase their power over our country."

 adventurer_estate_events.4.d:0 "The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ complain that an increasing number of serfs are deserting the safe homes provided to them to seek their fortune among the $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$. They feel we are to blame as we have allowed the $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$ to grow too powerful which is inspiring the serfs to abandon their rightful masters.\nRepresentatives of the major families now demand that we limit the power of the $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$ so that they can expand their latifundia in the regions bordering the steppe. This way, they argue, the wild fields can be tamed and the laws of the realm upheld."

 adventurer_estate_events.5.d:0 "Tension between the $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$ and the other estates is very common, if nothing else because of their uncommon manners and diverse backgrounds. Lately, however, this have increased considerably. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are alarmed at the $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$ raids and accuse them of robbing their traders. The $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$ themselves claim that they are only attacking monsters and bandits in the area and that the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are simply mistaken. As there is little in the way of government representation in the area it is difficult to ascertain the truth but there is clearly friction between these two groups and we are expected to either reprimand or sanction one side in this conflict."
