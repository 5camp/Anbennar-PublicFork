 flavor_sugamber.999.t: "Lisolette's Legitimacy Called into Question"
 flavor_sugamber.999.d: "After losing both sons in the Lilac wars and his wife to disease, Duke Ewald II legitimized his daughter, Lisolette. As she was a bastard from an affair with a kitchen maid, however, her claim to the throne is seen as less than legitimate to many in Sugamber. This has especially drawn the ire of Ewald II's cousin Ethelbert, as he is now no longer next in line for the throne."
 flavor_sugamber.999.a: "Ashes!"
 flavor_sugamber.1000.t: "Sugamber Succession Crisis"
 flavor_sugamber.1000.d: "A succession war is brewing in Sugamber. Ewald II's old hatred of Ethelbert has finally come back to bite him, as Ethelbert grows restless after being snubbed in the line of succession. Now, Ethelbert plots for his revenge while the nobles of the realm choose sides. The lines have been drawn, and only time will tell who comes out on top."
 flavor_sugamber.0.t: "The Plot Takes Shape"
 flavor_sugamber.0.d: "Now that Ewald II is dead, a group of pro-Ethelbert nobles have hatched a plan to assassinate Lisolette and take over the capital. However, this plan requires the cooperation of the Ducal Guard."
 flavor_sugamber.0.a: "The Ducal Guard contains many who are appalled by Ewald's treatment of his cousin."
 flavor_sugamber.0.b: "The captain of the guard honorably informs $MONARCH$ of this treason immediately."
 flavor_sugamber.1.t: "The Plotting Continues"
 flavor_sugamber.1.d1: "Apparently the rebel nobles and their collaborators weren't the largest fans of subtlety: they decided to just storm the palace, using treason within the guard to easily take it over and kill $MONARCH$ and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family. Whilst successful and quick it wasn't the best way to prevent unnecessary chaos."
 flavor_sugamber.1.d2: "Having infiltrated the ducal guard the conspirators were able to penetrate deep into the palace. They managed to bribe $MONARCH$'s cup bearer and taster and took [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] out with poisoned wine. Whilst Ethelbert's supporters were quick to acclaim him the rightful ruler, there are already rumours being spread by people who noticed the suspiciousness of the whole thing."
 flavor_sugamber.1.d3: "Having infiltrated the ducal guard the plotters assumed that their victory was certain, but they didn't count on wine loosening one of their tongues. In a drunken stupor one of them accidentally hinted to their plans, the innkeeper revealed this to $MONARCH$ in the hope of a reward. The defective guards were arrested in their beds, one of them betrayed everyone in the conspiracy in exchange for clemency. The remaining conspirators were then lured into the palace in the delusion that everything was going according to plan. Not a single one escaped."
 flavor_sugamber.1.d4: "On the last moment the conspirator responsible for contacting the captain of the guards got cold feet and delayed meeting him, unwittingly delaying his end. But it wasn't enough to save the conspirators, another one of them got cold feet and betrayed the plot in order to save himself. All the other traitors were caught in the night, with most ending up dead."
 flavor_sugamber.1.d5: "After receiving word of the conspiracy $MONARCH$, immediately sends the ducal guard to root out the traitorous nobles hiding in Rhinmond. Now they prepare their siege equipment to go after any accomplices who managed to escape towards their castles. This moment, however, gives the survivors of the plot an opportunity to take the initiative."
 flavor_sugamber.1.d6: "After receiving word of the conspiracy, $MONARCH$ immediately sends the ducal guard to root out the traitorous nobles hiding in Rhinmond. However this left the palace weakly defended which allowed a small group of the conspirators to sneak in and kill $MONARCH$ and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family. At the same time the ducal guard spread itself thin which allowed the rebels to pick them off in groups and take over the capital."
 flavor_sugamber.1.a: "Now Ethelbert can march victorious into the capital."
 flavor_sugamber.1.b: "Now we need to hunt down the surviving traitors before they can reorganize themselves."
 flavor_sugamber.2.t: "Pro-Lisolette Rebels Rise Up"
 flavor_sugamber.2.d: "After receiving word of the coup in the capital, a few officials loyal to Ewald II's will have called upon the people to rebel against the 'usurper' Ethelbert and avenge Lisolette. They are joined by a few aristocrats who see this as an opportunity to fight against rival noble houses. Their leader is Baldwin of Lockcastle, another cousin of Ewald II, who sees this as a possibility to gain the duchy for himself."
 flavor_sugamber.2.a: "Don't they see that resistance is futile?"
 flavor_sugamber.3.t: "Ethelbert Launches a Rebellion"
 flavor_sugamber.3.d: "After learning of what happened in the capital, Ethelbert quickly called on nobles friendly to his case and mercenaries to form an army and march on the capital. Whilst previously the privy council advised Lisolette to show leniency to Ethelbert, as they thought he might have been unaware of the plot him on the throne, the speed of his reaction proved he was aware of the plans of those traitorous nobles. Only force of arms can decide who will get the crown now."
 flavor_sugamber.3.a: "Death to the traitors!"
 flavor_sugamber.4.t: "Ethelbert Launches a Rebellion"
 flavor_sugamber.4.d: "After the death of the duke's daughter, Lisolette, the next heir to the throne is the duke's cousin Ethelbert, with whom Ewald II has a strong mutual dislike, going back to their youths. Now Ewald II has disinherited Ethelbert just to spite him, instead preferring his other cousin Baldwin as heir. Unsurprisingly, Ethelbert didn't take this well. He quickly called on nobles friendly to his case and mercenaries to form an army with and take with swords his birthright."
 flavor_sugamber.4.a: "Death to the traitors!"
 flavor_sugamber.5.t: "Gnolls Might Start Making Trouble"
 flavor_sugamber.5.d: "The province of Gnollsgate was conquered by Anbennarian forces a few years before the Lilac Wars and was thus never properly settled with loyal subjects. Now it appears the local gnollish population is up to something as reports of disappearing tax collectors reach our ears."
 flavor_sugamber.5.a: "Just ignore them."
 flavor_sugamber.5.b: "Preempt rebellion by make them fight the rebels."
 flavor_sugamber.5.c: "Keep them quite by lowering their taxes."
 flavor_sugamber.6.t: "The Civil War Hurts Our Agriculture."
 flavor_sugamber.6.d: "The civil war is destroying our crops! The need to fight keeps farmers away from their fields, while the fruits of their labour are being plundered by bandits and the enemy. In a normal war we could prevent the worst by using the surplus of unravaged provinces, but now this system is breaking down as the entire country is taking sides, spreading combat everywhere and creating a situation where villages don't know which side their neighbours are a part of."
 flavor_sugamber.6.a: "Why can't the peasants eat cake?"
 flavor_sugamber.6.b: "Just import food from abroad."
 flavor_sugamber.6.c: "Someone must be hoarding food, we must seize it."
 flavor_sugamber.7.t: "Siege of Escandar"
 flavor_sugamber.7.d: "The great fortress of Escandar has stood a bulwark upon the Khenek Range since Calasandur the Magnificent finished its constuction. Having impenetrable walls and sturdy battlements is no help, however, if one from within decides to betray its secrest. A local group of nobles taking shelter in Escandar have decided to switch sides to the rebels, greatly speeding up their siege."
 flavor_sugamber.7.a: "Ashes!"
 flavor_sugamber.8.t: "Our Soldiers Desert"
 flavor_sugamber.8.d: "The hardships of war and destruction of our grain surplus has led to many a civilian to abandon their homes. With no end in sight, our soldiers are also starting to desert in large droves."
 flavor_sugamber.8.a: "Let them go"
 flavor_sugamber.8.b: "Increase their pay"
 flavor_sugamber.8.c: "Our soldiers need the food more than our peasantry"
 flavor_sugamber.9.t: "Rebel Army Leader Captured"
 flavor_sugamber.9.d: "We have routed one of the rebel armies and in the process, have captured a group of noble instigators. Even now, many of the children are crying while the men and women alike beg for mercy and leniency. How shall we respond to their pleas?"
 flavor_sugamber.9.a: "Pardon them"
 flavor_sugamber.9.b: "Execute them and loot their holdings"
 flavor_sugamber.10.t: "A Succession War in Sugamber"
 flavor_sugamber.10.d1: "A succession war has broken out in our neighbor, with the two cousins of the previous duke fighting each other for the crown. We could try helping the rebels in order to weaken them, but if they end up losing this might strain our relations. Bisan and Celliande may even support the rebels in the hope that they might return the territory they lost in the Lilac wars."
 flavor_sugamber.10.d2: "A succession war has broken out in our neighbor. the former duke's cousin Ethelbert lost the right the throne and has now begun a rebellion to claim to crown. We could try helping Ethelbert in order to place someone indebted to us on the throne, but if he ends up losing this will strain our relations. Bisan and Celliande may even support the rebels in the hope that they might return the territory they lost in the Lilac wars."
 flavor_sugamber.10.a: "Send some unruly subjects to the rebels as 'volunteers'."
 flavor_sugamber.10.b: "Give the rebels some monetary aid."

 flavor_sugamber.17.d: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has just defeated the last of the rebels, whom rose up to take his throne. Despite saying no names he did mention in a speech he won't forget about any foreign powers who helped the 'traitors'."
 flavor_sugamber.17.a: "Not mentioning any names? That's how you recognize someone who's bluffing."
 flavor_sugamber.17.b: "Oh, good thing we didn't support the rebels then."
 flavor_sugamber.18.t: "Gnollish Officers?"
 flavor_sugamber.18.d: "One of the commanders of the gnollish mercenaries we hired appears to be a rather talented individual, who not only seems to be skilled in strategy, but also shows surprisingly little corruption and cruelty (for a gnoll). We could offer him a permanent job in our military, as not only would he prove helpful in strengthening our forces, but would also send a signal towards other subjugated gnollish communities that they will be rewarded if they make themselves useful."
 flavor_sugamber.18.a: "Give him a high function."
 flavor_sugamber.18.b: "We could give them a staff function behind the scenes"
 flavor_sugamber.18.c: "Gnolls already cause enough havoc without receiving high positions."
 flavor_sugamber.19.t: "To the Victor's Supporters go the Spoils"

 flavor_sugamber.20.t: "Returning Territory to Bisan?"
 flavor_sugamber.20.d: "In our struggle to enforce $MONARCH$'s rightful claim to the throne, we were forced to ask foreign powers for help. Those include Bisan who made clear they wanted the return of the territories they lost in the Lilac wars in exchange for their support, though as we gave them nothing but vague promises we might get away with few concessions."
 flavor_sugamber.20.a: "They can have Gnollsgate, the gnolls only make trouble anyway."
 flavor_sugamber.20.b: "Give them Countsbridge."
 flavor_sugamber.20.c: "Fullfill all their claims."
