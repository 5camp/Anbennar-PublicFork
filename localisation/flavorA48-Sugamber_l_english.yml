The defective gaurds were arrested in their beds, one of them betrayed everyone in the conspiracy in exchange for clemency. The remaining conspirators were then lured into the palace in the delusion that everything was going according to plan, not a single one escaped."
 flavor_sugamber.1.d4: "On the last moment the conspirator responsible for contacting the captain of the gaurds got cold feet and delayed meeting him, unwittingly delaying his end. But it wasn't enough to safe the conspirators, another one of them got cold feet and betrayed the plot in order to save himself. All the other traitors were caught in the night, with most ending up dead."
