#missions
B62_cursewood_connections_title:0 "Cursewood Castles"
B62_cursewood_connections_desc:0 "The half-elf kingdom of Farraneán maintained a network of fortress-cities, called the Caseáns. The structures themselves are in ruins now, but the logic behind them remains sound regardless of the failures and mixed blood of those who built them; great fortresses, with satellite villages dedicated solely to their supply and reinforcement, shall be established in the Cursewood to defend our lands from any Ibevari elf or Arbarani mongrel daring to attack us before we are ready for the Great Reclamation."
B62_agroda_weapons_title:0 "Agroda Weaponry"
B62_agroda_weapons_desc:0 "The discovery of ancient Agroda weaponry has excited our scholars! Once we have sufficient industry, we should adopt modernized versions of these weapons as our army's standard sidearm. Though blades may have little usage in modern warfare, their physical presence will connect our soldiers to their glorious past, ensuring they keep the martial legacy of our people in mind."
B62_archaeology_title:0 "Agroda Archaeology"
B62_archaeology_desc:0 "With control of the Agroda homeland, we can finally find relics showing the Agroda tribes to have spread wide and far throughout Escann, justifying our continued expansion as their heirs. And if we cannot find such relics, we shall simply create them."
B62_prepare_ritual_title:0 "Prepare Temple Site"
B62_prepare_ritual_desc:0 "With the rebirth of Agrador, we can begin the construction of a great temple to Agrados. This will allow us to centralize all infernal rituals, preventing the growth of any local power blocs as well making it easier to clean up after any deals gone bad."
B62_agrador_title:0 "Restore Agrador"
B62_agrador_desc:0 "The holiest site of the Agroda was named Agrador by the Castanite invaders and it's true name is lost to time, as well as it's precise location.

B62_humanity_inheritance_desc:0 "The first part of humanity's homeland, Escann, promised to mankind by our slain father Agrados, has been purified of dwarven and elven taint! With this achievement behind us, we may now advance further into Escann and take our birthright!"
B62_embrace_infernal_title:0 "Embrace the Infernal"
B62_embrace_infernal_desc:0 "The time for subtly has ended. We must openly embrace the Infernal Court if we want to truly share their might! Let us cast off our false faith and show the world the true glory of Moredhal. We may want to be careful though, such an action will almost certainly incite the other nations of the world against us, and our spies have reported that many surviving Escanni have begun rallying against us under the banner of a supposed descendant of the Farrani kings."
B62_unite_wescann_title:0 "Unite the Heartland"
B62_unite_wescann_desc:0 "If we are to build a new empire of humanity, we must secure our immediate surroundings and integrate the population. The region now called West Castanor was once the home of the Agroda tribe, called Agradosians by the Castanites and their descendants, but soon it shall be known as only the Moredhalic Heartland."
B62_build_agraced_title:0 "Build Agraced"
B62_build_agraced_desc:0 "The city of Castonath stands as a legacy of Castanor and so, if we are to forge a new Escanni culture, must be destroyed and remade in our image. Let us build a new city atop its ruins, a city built to glorify our conquest of this land; Agraced, City of War."
B62_army_of_man_title:0 "Army of Mankind"

B62_bal_mire_desc:0 "The citadel of Bal Mire was created by Balgar the Builder in 457. We must not only rebuild this citadel but, to show the superiority of human engineering over dwarven masonry, we must improve on it! We shall build a new Bal Mire that puts the old to shame."
