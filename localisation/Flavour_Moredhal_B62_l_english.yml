#missions
B62_cursewood_connections_title:0 "Cursewood Castles"
B62_cursewood_connections_desc:0 "The half-elf kingdom of Farraneán maintained a network of fortress-cities, called the Caseáns. The structures themselves are in ruins now, but the logic behind them remains sound regardless of the failures and mixed blood of those who built them; great fortresses, with satellite villages dedicated solely to their supply and reinforcement, shall be established in the Cursewood to defend our lands from any Ibevari elf or Arbarani mongrel daring to attack us before we are ready for the Great Reclamation."
B62_agroda_weapons_title:0 "Agroda Weaponry"
B62_agroda_weapons_desc:0 "The discovery of ancient Agroda weaponry has excited our scholars! Once we have sufficient industry, we should adopt modernized versions of these weapons as our army's standard sidearm. Though blades may have little usage in modern warfare, their physical presence will connect our soldiers to their glorious past, ensuring they keep the martial legacy of our people in mind."
B62_archaeology_title:0 "Agroda Archaeology"
B62_archaeology_desc:0 "With control of the Agroda homeland, we can finally find relics showing the Agroda tribes to have spread wide and far throughout Escann, justifying our continued expansion as their heirs. And if we cannot find such relics, we shall simply create them."
B62_prepare_ritual_title:0 "Prepare Temple Site"
B62_prepare_ritual_desc:0 "With the rebirth of Agrador, we can begin the construction of a great temple to the heir of Agrados, Kazraiel! This will be the first of seven planned temples to the Infernal Court, allowing us to centralize not only their worship but even more importantly the summoning of their devils.\n\nWe will now be able to ensure that if any infernal contracts go wrong, the damage can be contained, and if they go well we can easily take our cut."
B62_agrador_title:0 "Restore Agrador"
B62_agrador_desc:0 "The holiest site of the Agroda was named Agrador by the Castanite invaders and it's true name is lost to time, as well as it's precise location. However, we do know enough to place it in the Cannwood, which we now control. Let us make this name our own as we build a new Agrador!"
B62_humanity_inheritance_title:0 "Humanity's Inheritance"
B62_humanity_inheritance_desc:0 "The first part of humanity's homeland, Escann, promised to mankind by our slain father Agrados, has been purified of dwarven and elven taint! With this achievement behind us, we may now advance further into Escann and take our birthright!"
B62_embrace_infernal_title:0 "Embrace the Infernal"
B62_embrace_infernal_desc:0 "The time for subtly has ended. We must openly embrace the Infernal Court if we want to truly share their might! Let us cast off our false faith and show the world the true glory of Moredhal.\n\nWe may want to be careful though, such an action will almost certainly incite the other nations of the world against us, and our spies have reported that many surviving Escanni have begun rallying against us under the banner of a supposed descendant of the Farrani kings."
B62_unite_wescann_title:0 "Unite the Heartland"
B62_unite_wescann_desc:0 "If we are to build a new empire of humanity, we must secure our immediate surroundings and integrate the population. The region now called West Castanor was once the home of the Agroda tribe, called Agradosians by the Castanites and their descendants, but soon it shall be known as only the Moredhalic Heartland."
B62_build_agraced_title:0 "Build Agraced"
B62_build_agraced_desc:0 "The city of Castonath stands as a legacy of Castanor and so, if we are to forge a new Escanni culture, must be destroyed and remade in our image. Let us build a new city atop its ruins, a city built to glorify our conquest of this land; Agraced, City of War."
B62_army_of_man_title:0 "Army of Mankind"
B62_army_of_man_desc:0 "If we are to conquer the rest of Escann, we must build an army. Establishing the necessary infrastructure for the rapid training of new soldiers is the ideal first step. Once this is achieved, we can rely on our superior training methods and sheer size to overwhelm our rivals."
B62_bal_mire_title:0 "Restore Bal Mire"
B62_bal_mire_desc:0 "The citadel of Bal Mire was created by Balgar the Builder in 457. We must not only rebuild this citadel but, to show the superiority of human engineering over dwarven masonry, we must improve on it! We shall build a new Bal Mire that puts the old to shame."
B62_prepare_reclamation_title:0 "Prepare Reclamation"
B62_prepare_reclamation_desc:0 "Our control over Escann has now been assured with the destruction of the Farrani, as well as all other rebels. However, before we can push west and reclaim the heart of Cannor, we have to deal with local problems; the elves of the Forlorn Vale and the Deepwoods must die./n/nWe shall also have to decide what to do with the many orcs and goblins we have gained control over with our unification of Cannor; are they fellow sons of Agrados, albeit inferior ones, or merely another rival to crush while we establish humanity's dominance over the world?"
B62_entering_the_woods_title:0 "Entering the Woods"
B62_entering_the_woods_desc:0 "Before we can seek to purify the Deepwoods, we must secure a foothold within it. The Mountain Grove, home of the Ciranmyna mountain, is an excellent first target; not only do we have easy access to this grove, but the mines of Ciranmyna alone could be as valuable as the rest of the Deepwoods if properly exploited.\n\nOur generals have also identified the Silent Lake grove as an excellent target, perfectly placed for a future push into Daravan's Folly, but in truth so long as we conquer enough of the Deepwoods to stake our claim on its entirety the specifics don't matter."
B62_end_the_aldresians_title:0 "End the Aldresians"
B62_end_the_aldresians_desc:0 "The Orda Aldresia is not only responsible for the defeat of the White Pestilence, but is also the origin of some of the most successful adventurers that came to Escann. We must remove them from the Forlorn Vale before we can safely focus on the elves, otherwise we may find ourselves the target of a new Aldresian Crusade."
