 LILACWARS_NAME:0 "Scions of the Lilac Wars"
 LILACWARS_DESC:0 "A year has passed since the end of the Lilac Wars, a dynastic war of succession between the imperial Grand Duchy of Dameria and its neighbour, the Kingdom of Lorent. Lorent stands tired yet victorious, due to the betrayal of their Damerian enemies by their imperial allies like the Grand Duke of Wex, whom now holds the imperial seat. The balance of power is broken and new challenges will arise, but will the dream of Anbennar (unity) finally be achieved or will Cannor once again descend into chaos?"
 GREENTIDE_NAME:0 "The Greentide"
 GREENTIDE_DESC:0 "The Dookanson is dead, and with him any semblance of orcish unity. The realm's saviour, Corin, the avatar of the disgraced god of war Agrados, has paid for her life to end the near-unstoppable onslaught of orcdom that started a mere 20 years ago that killed even the White Dragon of the East, the Kingdom of Castellyr, in mere months. Escann remains in the grip of orcdom but new and heroic adventurers flock east every day seeking fortune, glory and victory over the orcish invaders, hoping to banish them to the darkness whence they came. Escann is ripe for the taking: will the orcs unite and bring death upon the rest of Cannor, or will the adventurers prove triumphant and recreate Escann in their vision? Whatever happens, whoever or whatever comes from the ashes of the east will surely upset the balance of power against the old guard of the west."
