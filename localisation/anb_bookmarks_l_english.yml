 LILACWARS_NAME:0 "Scions of the Lilac Wars"
 LILACWARS_DESC:0 "A year has passed since the end of the Lilac Wars, a dynastic war of succession between the imperial Grand Duchy of Dameria and its neighbour, the Kingdom of Lorent.
Lorent stands triumphant against its would-be-pretender, the Grand Duke of Dameria, Adénn the Skylance, lies dead – slain in battle, betrayed by his neighbouring imperial allies after his father, the once-Emperor Vincen I of Anbennar perished in 1422.
The civilized world stands in a period of recovery. Lorent stands tired from war against its imperial neighbours and faces internal conflict within. The Empire of Anbennar’s balance of power is shaken, its previous rulers, Dameria, wiped to near-extinction, replaced with by its enemy the Grand Duke of Wex as the new Emperor. New challenges arise, but will the dream of Anbennar (unity) finally be achieved or will Cannor once again descend into chaos?"
