Their motivations were that the Sil na Loop dynasty had increased too many taxes and levies in naval areas of the county over the decades.

Adelaïde dances in a frantic way until the crowd only looks at her and for a brief moment takes a serious attitude. The young woman shout to the dizzy crowd, "Death to Lorent!" "Our homeland isn't lost and if it is, we will recreate it!" as two guards unfurls two banners, one with the Toarnen flag and the other with the traditionnal emblem of Roilsard. To a mixture of applause and uncontrolled laughter, the queen declares that this party is the last of her reign and that now, in order to realize this dream, the whole duchy must prioritize a stronger society."            
 toarnese_events.2.a:0 "You heard that? Cheers! Another round to the Queen and to Roilsard!"

Adelaïde thought she would be welcomed like a hero returning from war but only a delegation is waiting at the port, the small group quickly join the palace. The ruler of Saloren proposes two nobles, both from good families who have nothing to lose by sending one of the many heirs away. One comes from a family of rich winemakers recently ennobled while the other comes from a family of knights known for their desire for independence from Lorent, Adelaïde hesitate for half a day but when the sun sets, she have made her choice."

 toarnese_events.6.t:0 "The Winner of the Contest!" 
 toarnese_events.6.d:0 "The final game is one of the most impressive since tournaments are made in Aiscestir. You start by the common Toarnese opening while your opponent defend with the Busilari defense. The Aldres' variation put your first line at risk but you manage to transform your opening into a King's Lorentish Attack. You can see his sweat while he try a Gnomo-Bulwari Defense.

The mansion is shaken by thunderous applause and the servants bring the trophy, your crown and a bag full of gold."

 toarnese_events.7.t:0 "Like petals on a calm sea" 
 toarnese_events.7.d:0 "Something unexpected arrived: Lorent administrators knew our plan since the start and let many Roilsardi go. As farmers depart, Lorentish landlords and loyalists come. Roilsard rebels will never be able to rise up but at least, Toarnen is their new home. But requesting a exceptionnal tax to "free our kin" don't make our population happy, thus organizing a shorter migration wave would help our finances and the population would be more favorable to our plans. But a bigger migration would make Toarnen much stronger on the long-term, and a real example of how we never forgotted our roots."          
 toarnese_events.7.a:0 "Let's fund a short migration, take onboard only the most loyal to Roilsard."

The walls of the forteress had been breached and the door exploded as cannonballs fired at it. Then, chaos ensued. The plaids became red and black like the mantle of some crusaders of the old times. The population remaining in the city was white like chalk due to their bloods being used by the vampires who revealed their powers after being forced to fight fifty-to-one. But how to recognize a vampire, and kill it? Nobody in the Toarnen army knew the answer. After the most powerful vampires were overwhelmed, hacked to pieces, thrown and burned at every side of the burning city, the remaining population suffered the same fate."

As [Root.Monarch.GetName] put the crown on his head a flag-bearer reveal a flag with a red background, the crowns of Roilsard and Toarnen merged in the center, the Corvurian white crow to the right and the Crusader's emblem to the left."
