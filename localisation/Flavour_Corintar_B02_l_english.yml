 corintar_the_fields_of_burnoll_title:0 "The Fields of Burnoll"
 corintar_the_fields_of_burnoll_desc:0 "Burnoll, now, is not much to behold: green grass, trees, a few nascent farms. But, under that earth is buried a considerable legacy. It is where Castan the Progenitor defeated the Xhazobine, the gnollish horde burned away with silver fire, and a new nation was born from its ashes.\n\nOur patron is Corin, not Castellos, and we are all entrusted with the responsibility of continuing her work, rather than leaving it to a distant silver dragon. But seeing these fields growing, a land that has known rivers of blood (and mountains of ash) learning peace and prosperity, marks a suitable start for our own work just the same."
 corintar_corinite_riders_title:0 "Corinite Riders"
 corintar_corinite_riders_desc:0 "\"I never liked horses. And they never liked me. Or Arosha. Or Creekwhistle. Thankfully, the Circle had little in the way of mounts when stuck behind enemy lines, though I know Sir Cecill missed the feeling of a good charge.\" -A brief aside in the memoirs of Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna\n\nSome have interpreted this passage, and Corin's own style of fighting, as proof the Corintar should shun cavalry altogether. In truth, such steeds will be necessary, whether it be messengers to keep knit our lands as they slowly heal or a rapid-response force to quickly meet orcish raids. Resettling Themin and reclaiming the lands' scattered herds will give us adequate stock to do so."
 corintar_aid_from_anbennar_title:0 "Aid From Anbennar"
 corintar_aid_from_anbennar_desc:0 "\"Evil knows no borders. Neither does your cause, nor your destiny.\" -Dominic of Gallowspeak, to Corin, in their conversations about her resurrection.\n\nTo the west, the Empire of Anbennar stands tall, the place where Corin's blade was sharpened and her skills honed. It proclaims unity, but goodness without action means nothing -- we must ensure they take up her work with vigor."
 corintar_return_of_the_farmers_title:0 "Return of the Farmers"
 corintar_return_of_the_farmers_desc:0 "Corin left her ruined farmtown in Eswall, only to return to Escann a heroine -- and more. We must not expect the same transformation from every returning refugee. It will be enough for the people who know the land best to tend it once more, and see it grow lush and verdant under their care."
 corintar_clear_the_woods_title:0 "Clear the Woods"
 corintar_clear_the_woods_desc:0 "Most Escanni shun Oldhaven, speaking in hushed tones of a generations-old curse. Even those that stayed would speak of a land that seemed to fight back against its inhabitants.\n\nBut we are not most Escanni. We are the Corintar, and we do not shy from evil. We will clear these haunted woods and banish whatever lingering shadows remain."
 corintar_enchanted_rain_title:0 "Corin's Blessing"
 corintar_enchanted_rain_desc:0 "\"How does she speak to us? She doesn't. She has already told us everything that needed saying, gave all the guidance we would need. Now it's on us to protect and strike true.\"\n-Lothane Bluetusk\n\nNone would argue with the sentiment of Bluetusk's teachings, but a torrential downpour of crimson rain was certainly more direct of a message than any would predict. Even now that the Deluge is passed, its message and impact lingers on. Its divine magic has seeped into the soil itself, Corin's blessing to her land and people, and all we require is a simple ritual to unlock its potential."
 corintar_rise_of_new_cities_title:0 "Rise of New Cities"
 corintar_rise_of_new_cities_desc:0 "From camp to small hamlet, from hamlet to walled village, and from village to thriving city- the new political and cultural centers of Escann may someday rival great Castonath itself.\n\nThough Corin is Mistress of War, the cities flourishing in our land show that in her wake, there is a deep and lasting prosperity. With her light shining bright, and all darkness banished, we grow and thrive and prosper."
 corintar_monastic_education_title:0 "Monastic Education"
 corintar_monastic_education_desc:0 "\"I learned more in one battle at Corin's side than in a decade at Nerat's temples. You will too.\" -Dominic of Gallowspeak\n\nFor most of the Corintar's history, even the most erudite of our members served as soldiers and generals simply as a matter of survival. Peace, and the simple prosperity it brings, has made that less of a guarantee. It is impossible to understand Corin's teachings without also knowing how to stand strong behind a shield, or how to wield a sword in pursuit of justice. We must codify our own curriculum to ensure new members learn these skills, even alongside Dominic's teachings and Bluetusk's memoirs."
 corintar_grannvale_recruits_title:0 "Grannvale Recruits"
 corintar_grannvale_recruits_desc:0 "An emissary has come from Grannvale, a small hamlet in Escerfork. The blue-haired half-elf, Seliff, is the son of the local baron, Sigurd, who ruled the area before the Greentide. Seliff served with the Marcher Lords, but struck out to Grannvale after the Battle of Castonath, seeking to rebuild his ancient home. Though he has made some progress, he claims that with our help the land could be made even brighter -- and promises that for as long as his line rules, every man born in Grannvale will serve five years in the Corintar.\n\nThis brave soul is emblematic of Corin's fire itself -- let us see his plan through!"

 corintar_lothanes_legacy_desc:0 "\"I could live a thousand lifetimes and still not match what she has done for us. I can only hope that I have done enough.\" -Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna, during his retirement speech\n\nWhen many Corin's Circle scattered on her death, Lothane stayed behind to guide her most faithful followers through a new era. His military and administrative reforms turns the Corintar from a simple adventuring band into a modern state, the organized political and military arm of Corin's will. With his passing, the Corintar mourns, though the institutions he built continue to thrive today."

Where Corin taught honor, many caved to greed. And where Corin taught equality, many turned aside. We cannot sit idle while this perversion of Corinite festers -- we will end orcish slavery for good, through guile and trade if we can, through blood and steel if we must."
 corintar_orcish_resurgence_title:0 "Orcish Resurgence"
 corintar_orcish_resurgence_desc:0 "It has been a long journey, fraught with challenge and opposition, but the green orcs once on the brink of destruction have returned to Escann. This time, they are not conquerors under the Dookanson, but acolytes under Corin. It was always her dream for orcs to walk among humans as equals, and death again fails to halt her ambition."
 corintar_carmine_red_title:0 "Carmine Red"
 corintar_carmine_red_desc:0 "A redtusk logger was the first to discover it: the fly that buzzed around him as he harvested another sturdy oak did not bleed when it was crushed -- it held a deep red dye inside. Richer and more easily woven into cloth, it became the dye of choice for local redtusk communities. In mere weeks, the woods across the Corintar were abuzz with loggers crushing Carmine Red. [Root.Capital.GetName] became an epicenter of the dye trade almost overnight, and Carmine Red is now bought and sold all across Cannor.\n\nToday, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stands at his balcony and surveys the fruit of this discovery -- eighty thousand soldiers stand before him, holding eighty thousand shields, each one painted with the burning red insignia of the Corintar."

 flavor_corintar.2.d:0 "With the recent declaration of Castellos' death, some have proclaimed that Corin is the true heir to the Regent Court and is most-fit to protect the divine and worldly realms from evil. It is our duty as her chosen to be the vanguards of her new, just, and good world!"
 flavor_corintar.2.a:0 "For Corin!"

 flavor_corintar.3.t:0 "Lothane Bluetusk's Leadership"
 flavor_corintar.3.d:0 "Memories. Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna has lots of those.\n\nHis earliest, the soft hands and warm tears of his mother, Ellis the Blue; a relic of hers to add to the Silmuna name and the blue scarf forever tied around his left tusk. His most recent, standing mere steps away from Corin, yet seemingly galaxies apart, as she rose her shield to defend him, slew and was slain by the Dookanson, and he watched the woman who had saved his life and his heart become something more.\n\nBut there are plenty of others that thrum through his brain as he sits in his tent in [Root.Capital.GetName], knowing soon he must rise and speak to Corin's — now whose? — Circle. His bitterest, watching sprawled on the ground, his sword and the two fingers it had carved from Karagh Bloodfist laying mere meters away, yet his arm still numb from the warleader's victorious blow in the Ozarm'Chadash, as his fellow half-orcs were executed to the man. His darkest, the time in a pit after that, cursing every god he knew the name of. His brightest, the sight of a human face, the red hair encircling it lit bright by the setting sun, offering him freedom from the pit in the ground and in his soul.\n\nAnd from there, it seems Corin is a bright red thread tangled through all his memories. His proudest, rising in a council of the Marcher Lords, seeing every face turn to him to outline their strategy — but his eyes only caught one other's. His most perplexed, as they spoke one night of her death at Rottenstep, and he strained his mind to encompass it. His most joyful, the night in her arms, and she in his, not two weeks prior.\n\nBut all that is the past now, severed as permanently from the present as Corin is now from mere mortality. It is just another thing he carries, like the scarf on his tusk. And so it is time for him to rise, speak to Her circle and Her followers. Her work is not yet done, and it is up to us on Halann to see it through."
 flavor_corintar.3.a:0 "We are the Corintar, and Bluetusk shall lead."

 flavor_corintar.4.t:0 "Lothane Bluetusk Retires"
 flavor_corintar.4.d:0 "It's not easy work, leading the Corintar. In fact it's quite difficult, shepherding this ragtag band of adventurers turned something more. Even though the manic chaos of those first few years has passed, when he forged a broken circle into Escann's sword and shield, Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna's work hasn't ceased.\n\nThere are always more campaigns to plan, even if he's not at their vanguard. There are always more adventuring disputes to smooth over, the same arguments arising again and again to the point he feels he could handle them in his sleep. There are always more forms to sign, more work orders to requisition, more trade agreements to be forged, new land to divvy up and old grudges to sort out. It's enough that the days blur by, sometimes. And the weeks, and the months. And the years.\n\nOr so Lothane realizes, one day, as he sits at his desk in the center of [Root.Capital.GetName]. What once was a command tent became the largest room in a hastily-constructed fort, then a similar space in a somewhat more sturdy fort, and now they've relocated him into one of the growing city's new castles. But when he puts down the paperwork, and steps into the stone hallways outside, he realizes he doesn't know anyone in the Corintar by name anymore.\n\nHe can still remember, vividly, Arosha's wicked grin as she bested him in a duel, Foolfoot's smile as he dealt a round of cards, Creekwhistle's fiery anger. But the faces that scurry through dusty corridors and bring him forms to sign, all those souls in the nearby, new-built, houses? They all love and respect him, but not a single one knows him.\n\nHe's pretty sure he's the only one that remembers the heft of Corin's blade, the dented steel of her shield; all the icons that crop up carved into wood or sketched on parchment don't quite capture it. And the ribbon around his tusk has frayed to mere strands.\n\nIt's time to go. Put down the sword, let someone else hold the shield. A quill, and a piece of parchment, and memories of love and loyalty and something more, will do for him now."
 flavor_corintar.4.a:0 "We wish him luck in retirement."

 flavor_corintar.5.t:0 "Funeral of Lothane Bluetusk"
 flavor_corintar.5.da:0 "In Escann, half-orcs die. Like any mortal being, it is the one fate common to each. Mere moments after entering the world for some, after long strife-filled decades for others. They die from battle, from hunger, from illness, from all the scourges of a war-torn land. Only ever-so-rarely do they die having lived a hundred years and change, surrounded by their children, their legacy secure.\n\nBut — defying the odds one last time — that is how Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna died today.\n\nThe past few decades had been busy, but not unkind, for the half-orc. There was a small cottage, in the yet-untamed woods on the outskirts of [Root.Capital.GetName]. There was learning to share what remained of his heart. There was even an unexpected joy, raising children. And above all else, there was the writing, the memories.\n\nBluetusk had traded his sword and shield for quill and parchment, calloused hands working long hours by candlelight. For there was so much to share, so much that needed to be known. His first conversation with Corin, the night after she rescued him from the pit. The lessons in ethics and morals gathered accompanying her into battle. And all those hours the night before the battle of Castonath, the most searing glimpse he ever got of her burning soul. Wherever it was she had gone, he remained on Halann, and so did so many who needed to learn her ways.\n\nBut that is past, now. It is time for him to be laid to rest, his crusade finally coming to an end. He shall be mourned across the Corintar, across Escann. And perhaps, in wherever it is the Gods reside, the lady he gave his heart and soul to shall mourn him as well."
 flavor_corintar.5.db:0 "In Escann, half-orcs die. Like any mortal being, it is the one fate common to each. Mere moments after entering the world for some, after long strife-filled decades for others. They die from battle, from hunger, from illness, from all the scourges of a war-torn land. Only ever-so-rarely do they die having lived a hundred years and change, surrounded by their children, their legacy secure.\n\nBut — defying the odds one last time — that is how Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna died today.\n\nThe past few decades had been busy, but not unkind, for the half-orc. There was a small cottage, in the yet-untamed woods on the outskirts of [Root.Capital.GetName]. There was learning to share what remained of his heart. There was even an unexpected joy, raising children. And above all else, there was the writing, the memories.\n\nBluetusk had traded his sword and shield for quill and parchment, calloused hands working long hours by candlelight. And from him poured every tenet of our faith. That first conversation after being rescued from the pit: a lesson that only a pure devotion to doing good can sustain the soul. The laws of ethics and morals, gathered accompanying her into battle. And the commandment to hunt evil, wherever one might find it, related to him the night before the Battle of Castonath. She had gone to lead the gods, while he remained on Halann, to lead her faithful.\n\nBut that is past, now. It is time for him to be laid to rest, and for us to renew our commitment to the crusade he began. He shall be mourned across the Corintar, across Escann, by every soul sworn to Corin's cause. And perhaps, in wherever it is the Gods reside, the lady he gave his heart and soul to shall mourn him as well."
