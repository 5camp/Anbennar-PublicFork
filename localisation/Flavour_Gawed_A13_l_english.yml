 flavor_gawed.1.t:0 "Burning of the Redglades"
 flavor_gawed.1.d:0 "A cry of "Sire! Sire!" rings out throughout the din of the war room. The clamor of generals and messengers hushes into a terse silence. You wearily trace the disturbance to its source - a sweating, frantic looking youth, disheveled in appearance and sweating with exhaustion. You regard him testily, giving him a brief moment to find his breath.\n\nThe messenger inclines his head and takes a knee. "They are routed! The Gawedi Eagle flies high above the Forest!"\n\nThe tent erupts into a cacophony of cheers, congratulating themselves on the turn of events. You rise hastily, fastening your scabbard to your hip, previous fatigue banished. The youngster, just a boy, really, flinches as your hand falls to his shoulder. "Valiant cousin!" you exclaim, "See yourself dismissed." You bark an order at a retainer, instructing him to accommodate the boy in the reserve camp. You leave the tent, eager to join your men. The sacred elven ground would be put to the torch. They would have their retribution upon that cursed Ioriel. The elves wanted their scourge, well, they would have it. For the Gawedi people refused to be appeasers any more."
 flavor_gawed.1.a:0 "Take heed, fellow man. The Redglades Forest burns!"
 
 flavor_gawed.2.t:0 "Burning of the Redglades"
 flavor_gawed.2.d:0 "You thought they were rumours, but officials have declared it to be true. Smoke and ash flies high above the Redglades Forest, Ioriel's gift upon her elven people for their place in saving the Free Realms during the War of the Sorcerer King. The Redglades were a symbol of gratitude from all of Cannor to the elven people... until now.\n\nThe Gawedi scourge have done the unspeakable and razed the forest to the ground. Scarcely few elves survive to tell the tale, but all is clear: the wanton slaughter and desecration of sacred elven ground confirms the basis that has clouded the minds of the south for too long - that the Gawedi are nothing more than barbarians and should be treated as such."
 flavor_gawed.2.a:0 "This is preposterous! Denounce Gawed!"

 flavor_gawed.3.t:0 "The Alenic Countryside Converts to Corin"
 flavor_gawed.3.d:0 "The poorer country-folk of the Alenic Frontier felt the Greentide harder than most, and it seems now that the message of Corin, particularly the one about just rulers that are in touch with the common people, have resonated with them. The flames of Corinite zeal begin to fester in the countryside, whilst the arguably richer lords along the wealthy river Alen begin to crack down on any Corinite murmurs in reactionary fashion..."
 flavor_gawed.3.a:0 "Ignore them, they're just peasants."
 flavor_gawed.3.b:0 "Corin is the true successor to Castellos!"
 
 flavor_gawed.4.t:0 "Derek Deland"
 flavor_gawed.4.d:0 "Derek Deland was born and raised in Celmaldor to the influential Deland family prominent merchants who made their wealth through trading fabrics along the Reach. The Deland family however fell into hard times, blaming favourable treatment towards elven merchants on their failure Derek came to the court of Gawed seeking their aid in return for his expertise and connections.\n\nWhen Derek arrived Gawed was greatly indebted from grand expenditures by the, at the time, young Prince Welyam III. In order to combat this Derek created an advisory board, the Board of Magnates; composed of the most prominent merchant families of the realm they would advise the king on financial matters. Under their careful guidance Gawed was brought back from the brink and to this day they advise the King on financial matters, bringing great wealth to both the Gawedi treasury and their own pockets."
