 kairncal_prepare_for_southern_eordan_expedition_desc:0 "To the south of Eordand lies an arid peninsula inhabited by the Fograc, a people who long ago rejected the Eordellon faith. These lands would be of little interest were it not for the presence of Precursor ruins. Let us send an Eordan Expedition out, to find these ruins and the knowledge that has been left behind."
 kairncal_convert_the_fograc_title:0 "Convert the Fograc"
 kairncal_convert_the_fograc_desc:0 "The first step of our expedition should be to enlist the help of the Fograc. Although they had rejected our faith, they are our wayward brethren. If we would show them the light of our ways, perhaps they could help us in our expedition?"
 kairncal_venture_further_south_title:0 "Venture Further South"
 kairncal_venture_further_south_desc:0 "The expedition into the Fograc lands has been enlightening but almost disappointing. Their lands are meagre and unimpressive, there surely must be more to the South. The lands south are blessed by the Summer, ever increasingly warmer and tropical. There are also Kheionai merchants who have ventured into the Sarmadfar from the south before. We must mount an expedition further south to discover what riches lie there."

 kairncal_foothold_in_haraf_desc:0 "To the south of the great desert lies a vast land blessed by the Summer's light. Warm and plentiful, they seem like a paradise to the Caamasi. However, this land is not empty. The 'Haraf'ne' lay claim to the more arid north, the Kooras in the savanna, and some curious mouthless peoples who watched our explorers from afar. Regardless of the strange inhabitants, this land has beckoned many Caamasi towards it, the land seemingly blessed by the Summer itself. Let us help them stake claim in these lands."
 kairncal_urdea_samrad_title:0 "Urdea Samrad"
 kairncal_urdea_samrad_desc:0 "The colonization of Haraf has been a success, with many Caamas settling in these warm lands honoring the Summer. A wide river and protected harbor, the perfect location for the keystone of our settlement in Haraf, has been found and chartered. It will be called Urdea-Samrad, the bastion of the Summer and staging point for all our future endeavours. A grand lighthouse tower shall be constructed, a guiding beacon towards our new land."
