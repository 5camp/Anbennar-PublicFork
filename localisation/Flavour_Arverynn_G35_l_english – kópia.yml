 flavor_arverynn.0.d:0 "While we, of house Vyrekynn, would be the rightful rulers of all the Ynn, our claims are denied as most of the land is held by petty lords who only think of themselves. Recently, we have been defeated by one such warlord, Alaran of Trompolere, who after destroying our army seized our castle of Arvezl then marched on Arverynn. To protect the city, we had to pay him with much of the Imperial coffers, convincing him to conduct his razings and pillagings elsewhere, but we still lost greatly from the war."
