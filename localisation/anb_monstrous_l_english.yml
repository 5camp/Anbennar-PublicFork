 monstrous.1.t:0 "Middle of the Road"
 monstrous.1.d:0 "The [Root.Country.GetAdjective] people have made great advances in Demonsterizing, and have managed to validate ourselves someone in the eyes of the greater world. Nations will now think twice before dismissing us as mindless monsters whose only fate is to be driven out and killed. We have proven ourselves as a fledgling state eager to show their their mettle through proper, civil, means!"
 monstrous.1.a:0 "The Road Continues"
 
 monstrous.2.t:0 "[Root.GetName]: Equal Amongst Men"
 monstrous.2.d:0 "Long has been our journey, but finally, we have proven to all those who have doubted us that we are true and respectable members of the civilized and international community... whether they like it or not!\n\nLong are the days of [Root.GetAdjective] people were slaughtered by bands of greedy adventurers, no, now we are the quest givers!"
 monstrous.2.a:0 "A New Beginning"
 
 monstrous.3.t: "Of Monsters and War"
 monstrous.3.d: "Our monstrous nature has allowed our people to be ferocious and savage in combat. For aeons our dominions have been a monstrous frontier, unwelcome to most and dangerous to all. We do not subscribe to the civilities of warfare. Our people have fought for their land. Our people have fought to win. Our people have fought to survive.\n\nBut the reformists in our ranks say that we must hold ourselves to a standard greater than our own, that we must fight on the same playing field as our more civilized neighbours. Take prisoners, not slaves. Show mercy to respectable foes... keep our savagery in check."
 monstrous.3.a: "We must fight with dignity!"
 monstrous.3.b: "We are what we are."

 monstrous.4.t: "Monstrous Borders"
 monstrous.4.d: "Borders and the notion of nation states do not bother monsters. We live free with the land, and the land we own is the land we stand on. The nearby province of [province.GetName] has long suffered frequent incursions by our kind, and by monstrous rights we are able to claim it... but the reformists amongst us say that we should start respecting borders set by others."
 monstrous.4.a: "We must renounce our claim"
 monstrous.4.b: "That land belongs to us!"
 
 monstrous.5.t: "Monstrous Diplomacy"
 monstrous.5.d: "Since our decision to Demonsterize we have been sending envoys to nearby lands to meet and speak with any and anyone rather than fight and kill like the old days. One such event with [country.GetName] has proved great difficulty for our envoys, as their people seem to be intolerant of our ways and look to belittle and insult us on every turn!"
 monstrous.5.a: "We must work harder to reconcile our differences"
 monstrous.5.b: "Curse them. This calls for aggressive negotations!"

 monstrous.6.t: "Protocols of Conquest"
 monstrous.6.d: "Our attempts to legitimize our nation in the eyes of the international community has raised questions on how we conduct ourselves in war, and more importantly: conquest. We are used to the rule by strength. The strong rules. The strong keeps what they earn.\n\nBut apparently the greater world prefers war with just causes, and this ridiculous thing called a 'Casus Belli'! Perhaps learning more about the ways of warfare will teach us a thing or two about conducting ourselves in military affairs."
 monstrous.6.a: "Learn the protocols of war"
 monstrous.6.b: "It's simple: if its ours, its ours!"
 protocol_of_conquest:0 "Protocols of Conquest"
 
 monstrous.7.t: "Newfound Decorum?"
 monstrous.7.d: "Our efforts to Demonsterize and show ourselves worthy in partaking in the wider community as equals has led to our people learning more about how to hold oneself in conversation. Where it be etiquette, to things like bowing or how to eat - and even things like learning their language and offering cultural exchanges.\n\nIf we wish to continue down this path, we could fund and exemplify our efforts in this matter - and it will surely have an effect to the world at large!"
 monstrous.7.a: "Hello, good sir!"
 monstrous.7.b: "GRAAAAAH!"
 monstrous_newfound_decorum:0 "Newfound Decorum"
 
 monstrous.8.t: "Societal Reforms"
 monstrous.8.d: "With our forays to Demonsterize we have started to observe how other countries conduct themselves in the affairs of the state: how they govern, how they pass and enforce laws, and so on. If we are to truly join them in the international society we must press forward with reforms of our own, at any cost."
 monstrous.8.a: "To Progress!"
 monstrous.8.b: "Never!"

 monstrous.9.t: "Traders in the Monstrous Frontier"
 monstrous.9.d: "The merchants of [country.GetName] have petitioned us to provide favourable tarrifs and preferential treatment for their businesses in our land. After all, if we are to be one of them - surely we should learn to play by the rules?\n\nSome in our great realm suggest that these wretched snakes are in fact attempting to manipulate our inexeperience in the affairs of trade... but surely they wouldn't do that? Would they?"
 monstrous.9.a: "Uh, sure, do what you want"
 monstrous.9.b: "We are not stupid!"
