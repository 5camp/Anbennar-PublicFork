    flavor_ravenmarch.3.d:0 "A letter has arrived from Corvuria, inviting [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] to attend a grand masquerade gala. As the invitation is from a minor scion of [A59.GetDynasty], the expectation is that we shall attend, and appear in the latest styles."

    flavor_ravenmarch.4.d:0 "As [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] steps into the ballroom, wearing a black and white mask that covers the left side of their face, they are greeted by the sight of a swirling throng of garishly dressed ball-goers. A servant wearing a simple red mask, hands [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] a fine glass of Toarnen Black, before swiftly departing, leaving [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] to survey the ballroom.\n\nSizing up the ballroom, three people catch [ROOT.Monarch.GetName]’s eye. Standing on the terrace, a man in a grinning oni mask swirls his wine, alone but for his thoughts. Engaged in conversation, a woman in an ornate bird mask lightly laughs before starting to cross the floor. Near the front of the ballroom, a tall man in a fanged wolf mask cracks a joke, causing the people around him to chuckle before moving on, leaving him alone."
    flavor_ravenmarch.4.a:0 "Join the man in the grinning oni mask on the terrace"

    flavor_ravenmarch.5.d:0 "Not noticing you at first, the man sips his win while gazing off at the horizon. After a moment, he glances over, seeming surprised to see anyone.\n\n’Ah, good evening.’, he says, dropping into a polite bow.\n\n ‘I was just admiring the way the light plays upon the rooftops. A pleasure to meet you. Tell me, do you know much about governance? I happen to manage many estates and keeping them all running smoothly is quite a task, why one time…’ It’s clear that he intends to go on for some time."
    flavor_ravenmarch.5.a:0 "Listen to the man in the oni mask"
    flavor_ravenmarch.5.b:0 "Drift away into the rest of the ballroom"

    flavor_ravenmarch.6.t:0 "The Ornate Bird Mask"
    flavor_ravenmarch.6.d:0 "As you approach, the woman in the bird mask steps off the ballroom floor to a more quiet portion of the room. ‘Ah, delighted to meet you.’, she says as she drops into a curtsy, ‘These affairs lose so much of their charm when there are no new faces, so I make sure to keep an ear out for fresh blood. Tell me, what are your thoughts on Escann? Many here view it as a backwater that we are lucky to have the Godshield preventing us from being associated with. Old money and power like them find any change distasteful, no matter what it is.’"

    flavor_ravenmarch.7.d:0 "Eyeing you up as you approach, the man in the fanged wolf mask smirks and sweeps into a low bow. With a deep voice, he says ‘Greetings, stranger. Would you care to join me? I assure you that here only those of appropriate pedigree are allowed. The only commoners present know their place is beneath us, serving our drinks.’ He throws back his half-full glass of wine as a servant passes, before snatching another one out of their hands. ‘You simply have to keep them on their toes, so they know their place, wouldn’t you agree?"

    flavor_ravenmarch.8.d:0 "STUB: As you spend the evening in conversation, drinking wine, and dancing, [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] cannot help but notice that as the masquerade progresses, more and more people seem to be eyeing them. As a servant hands you another glass of Toarnen Black, a young man with a crimson and gold mask firmly bumps you from behind with their shoulder, almost causing  [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] to spill the full glass.\n\n’It looks like the entertainment has arrived everyone!’, the young man shouts, smirking, ‘Watch as a backwater provincial tries to blend in with real nobility! Tell me, does the far side of the Godshield have civilization, or is it just rabble emulating their betters and pretending they saved the world from something that couldn’t even leave Escann? You adventurers who went off to fight, tell me, did they teach you how to use a sword, or did they simply have you punch the orcs?"
    flavor_ravenmarch.8.a:0 "Shall I show you how we fight in [ROOT.Country.GetName], or are you too soft to duel?"

    flavor_ravenmarch.10.d:0 "The center of the ballroom floor clears, as [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] and the offensive young man select blades from an attendant. [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] selects a simple, practical saber, with filigree on the handguard, while their opponent selects an ornate, engraved rapier.\n\nA murmur ripples through the attentive crowd as both take up dueling stances.\n\nThe young man unleashes a rapid barrage of thrusts and feints, pressing [ROOT.Monarch.GetName]’s guard, before dropping low and thrusting upwards. [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] dives out of the way, landing in a roll and slashing as they rise. While the young man pivots to face [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName], the tip of the saber presses to his throat. The room is silent save for the sound of his sliced cape falling to the ground and his voice calling out.\n\n’Clearly I was misinformed about [ROOT.Country.GetAdjective] skill with a blade, I yield.’"

    flavor_ravenmarch.12.t:0 "Blessing of the Faithful"
    flavor_ravenmarch.12.d:0 "In the weeks after the masquerade, word has spread of the chivalrous behavior of [ROOT.Monarch.GetName]. Many clergymen and pious nobles have reached out with offers of assistance and public donations. Several sermons in the many steeples of Gablaine have highlighted how [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] embodies the might and honor of Corin, the grace of Ryala, and the keen judgment of Nerat. Should we accept their offers, our standing in the eyes of the faithful will surely rise."

    flavor_ravenmarch.13.d:0 "A gasp ripples through the crowd as the saber opens the impertinent duelist’s throat, and [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] tosses the sword to the ground with a clatter, before calmly spinning and walking through them to an empty balcony, shutting the door behind them. As [ROOT.Monarch.GetSheHe] places their arms on the balcony and leans over the edge, from the side, a voice speaks.\n\n’That was quite an impressive display of swordsmanship. While many of us had our eyes on you and your nation, I feel confident in saying that with the… eagerness you dispatched that young lordling, many of us would be happy to lend you some assistance.’\n\nGlancing around, [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] notices a man dressed in crimson formalwear who was not on the balcony a moment ago.\n\n‘I represent a group of individuals who have been handling power with similar ruthlessness for far longer than most of those you left inside. We can offer your foundling nation many opportunities, provided your taste for blood extends to more than just ballroom dueling."
