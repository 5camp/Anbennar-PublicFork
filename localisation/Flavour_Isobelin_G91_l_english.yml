 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_river_title:0 "The Lady’s River"
 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_river_desc:0 "The explorers, traders, and unruly adventurers departing from the docks of Isobel Island to find their fortunes inland have taken to calling the river up which they sail the Lady Isobel. The report lands that may be put to good use supporting a growing city. By sponsoring our own expeditions to chart, claim, and settle the lands adjoining the Lady’s River, we can make this true in more than name only."
 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_landing_title:0 "The Lady’s Landing"
 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_landing_desc:0 "We have had the fortune of landing on a stretch of Aelantir’s coast positively brimming with opportunities: an archipelago of islands with deep natural harbors, fields ripe for planting on the mainland, and a wide river that beckons us to the interior. We must seize this opportunity before other arrivals from the Old World snatch it up."
 isobelin_mission_the_dream_of_a_city_title:0 "The Dream of a City"
 isobelin_mission_the_dream_of_a_city_desc:0 "“A fortnight past our entrance to the Ruinous Sea, we beheld the Island, cresting over the tides, as a dream of dawn crests over a night of terrors.”\n- From the Journal of Lady Isobel\n\nFrom the Lilac Wars, Greentide, and Age of Cinders, to the new conflicts bubbling below the surface, the cities of Cannor and Bulwar have known nothing but fire and death at the hands of monsters and petty men, often one and the same. Here, in this new land, we have a chance to plant the seed of a new city away from the wreckage of our homelands, a rose whose bloom shall be the envy of the whole world, a dream made manifest."
 isobelin_mission_fort_and_walkway_title:0 "Fort and Walkway"
 isobelin_mission_fort_and_walkway_desc:0 "Commerce must flow from the lands beyond the Cliffs of Ruin for our city to blossom. Already plans have been drawn up for a grand walkway, bedecked with all manner of plantlife, traversing the natural passage where the Lady Isobel meets the cliffs. And just as the most beautiful rose needs thorns to protect it, we have broken for a stronghold to secure the walkway from threats from above and below."
 isobelin_mission_a_rose_garden_in_the_swampland_title:0 "A Garden in a Swamp"
 isobelin_mission_a_rose_garden_in_the_swampland_desc:0 "We find ourselves far away from the verdant vineyards of Lencenor, amongst strange landscapes. The Trollsmaw Swamp, teeming with life, may offer fertile ground to transplant Cannorian flora. Indeed, some recently arrived transmuters from the Magesterium have claimed that a clever use of the plant growth spell may create not just a lush rose garden, but even enhance the defenses of the Fort itself, ensconcing the walls and towers with giant vines that can whip their thorns at would be attackers."
 isobelin_mission_control_the_troll_toll_title:0 "Control the Troll Toll"
 isobelin_mission_control_the_troll_toll_desc:0 "The islands of [1051.GetName] lie at the entrance of the Trollsbay, and are perfectly situated to collect a toll from ships passing into and out of the bay. Of course, any clever captain will seek to circumvent such a toll. To safeguard our commercial interests, and to ensure the rule of law - and therefore toll collection - is respected, we should establish a base on these islands and a fleet of ships capable of enforcing the Troll Toll."
 isobelin_mission_up_the_ynn_title:0 "Up the Ynn"
 isobelin_mission_up_the_ynn_desc:0 "By the reports of intrepid explorers stopping in Port Isobel, the Ynn is truly massive, its watershed stretching across the entire continent, making our Lady’s River seem like a pleasant brook in comparison. They report an frightful, eerie feeling from the swamp at the river’s mouth, as if the water were speaking to them, but most brave it to reach the riches beyond the Cliffs. We must control this passage into the interior if we are to dominate the commerce of the Trollsbay."
 isobelin_mission_isobels_will_title:0 "The Widow’s Will"
 isobelin_mission_isobels_will_desc:0 "Upon her passing, the Esteemed Widow has left us not just the remainder of her considerable fortune, but parting words of wisdom: true freedom for all is to be found when all submit to the rule of law. Although this ideal is hard to imagine in the chaotic wake of a century of catastrophes - the Greentide, the Lilac Wars, the Crimson Deluge - it is one which shall be a guiding light as we build our city."
 isobelin_mission_found_mawgate_prison_title:0 "Found Mawgate Prison"
 isobelin_mission_found_mawgate_prison_desc:0 "Theft, brawls, public drunkenness, and worse: Isobelin faces the same crimes and disorder as any other fast growing colony brimming with opportunity. However, if we hew to our founding ideals, we must not settle for mere frontier justice. We should establish courts of law, and a prison for those who have been found guilty can serve their sentences. A rocky island in the middle of the River at the entrance of the Trollsmaw Swamp may be a prime location."
 isobelin_mission_cultivate_cult_contacts_title:0 "Cultivate Cult Contacts"
 isobelin_mission_cultivate_cult_contacts_desc:0 "The Cheshoshi certainly made an impression when they first appeared at the periphery of our settlements, their skin tattooed pitch black, terrifying and angering our friends among the Jayek. It soon became clear that although they worshiped death, plenty of them still wanted to make a living - as mercenaries, they could hold their own against both Cannorians and ruinborn alike, and for a reasonable price. Deepening this commercial relationship and expanding into their southern markets could prove to be immensely profitable, if distasteful to some of our citizens."
 isobelin_mission_tower_street_title:0 "Tower Street"
 isobelin_mission_tower_street_desc:0 "Among the first permanent buildings we constructed on Isobel Island was a lighthouse to guide ships into port. Soon, market stalls sprung up around it, and one of the main thoroughfares of the Island snaked its way away from it. Tower Street has quickly become synonymous with the bustling commercial life of our growing city. Everything can be bought, sold, bartered (and occasionally stolen) here from swords and shields, to Roilsardi wine, to hulking orcs bound in shackles. We should cement our leading role as Trollsbay’s premier center of commerce by expanding and bringing order to Tower Street."
 isobelin_mission_jayek_bridge_title:0 "The Twin Bridges"
 isobelin_mission_jayek_bridge_desc:0 "We have begun to build roads over the hunting trails lacing through Isobel Island cut by the Jayek long ago, but transportation between the archipelago and the mainland is limited to ferries and other small watercraft. This restraint on the free movement of goods and people will hamper our development. Fortuitously, a new dwarf arrival from Menibór has drawn up an ambitious proposal modeled on his people’s masterful bridgebuilding over the Luna: twin bridges of rock and iron, connecting Jayekmoot to Isobel Island, and Isobel Island to the mainland."
 isobelin_mission_city_hall_title:0 "Isobelin City Hall"
 isobelin_mission_city_hall_desc:0 "As our city has developed, political fractures have started to emerge, and old tensions find life in the new world. The Roilsardi who originally accompanied the Widow across the sea wish to preserve their privileged positions, while new arrivals from Anbennar, Lorent, and Bulwar are fighting to ensure they have a place in the city. Some amount of conflict is necessary for a state’s continued vitality, but not so much that it threatens to boil over into the streets. We should establish both physical and political structures to ensure that this enriches Isobelin with reasoned debate, rather than compromise it through mindless bloodshed."
 isobelin_mission_the_navy_yard_title:0 "The Navy Yard"
 isobelin_mission_the_navy_yard_desc:0 "From great galleons filled with dreamers from Cannor seeking new shores, to simple dinghies with their simple fishermen seeking today’s catch, ships are the lifeblood of our city. A great number are in need of repair and refitting after making the perilous journey across the ocean. Having a dedicated shipyard would make Isobelin the maritime hub for the whole Trollsbay, and would also give us the facilities to construct our own fleet for war and commerce."
 isobelin_mission_an_awakening_city_title:0 "An Awakening City"
 isobelin_mission_an_awakening_city_desc:0 "Insults, followed by shouts, followed by hands reaching for daggers, as a half-orc laborer, sweaty from a day's work, and a well-dressed Roilsardi aristocrat bump shoulders on Tower Street - halted by the arrival of a stern patrolman of the Republican Guard. Coins clinking on a table in a nearby in a cramped counting house, as a local merchant concludes an exchange with her counterpart from Vertesk - twenty bales of cotton and a precious artifact from the Precursor Elves, for twelve kegs of Varainéy gunpowder, and nine shackled orcs from Escann. Down the road, nails hammering into beams as a gregarious Brasani carpenter and his taciturn Jayek apprentice raise a new addition to an already haphazard tenement. The sounds of a city stirring, as Isobelin awakes."
 isobelin_mission_rehabilitate_the_ruinborn_title:0 "Rehabilitate the Ruinborn"
 isobelin_mission_rehabilitate_the_ruinborn_desc:0 "“Written on their very faces was ruin, and while their visages brought bats and beasts to mind, their hearts were love-filled just as ours. Pity, these creatures need, not revulsion.”\n-The Journal of Lady Isobel\n\nOur Lady landed on these shores with a dream of a home for all, united under the law, with the promise of flourishing through hard work and self-betterment. This promise should be available not just to new arrivals like us, but to those who lived on these shores when we landed. The Jayek have shown their worth ten times over. We should help them elevate themselves to their highest potential."
 isobelin_mission_the_twin_batteries_title:0 "The Twin Batteries"
 isobelin_mission_the_twin_batteries_desc:0 "Almost as soon as we planted our flag on Isobel Island, we moved quickly to establish an outpost across the bay. While this stretch of mainland does not offer the same deep water harbors as the Island, it serves as a vital ferry terminal for goods and people traveling to the interior. It is necessary for the growth of the city that we secure the mouth of the Lady’s River against raids by sea and by land by constructing twin batteries facing east and west."
 isobelin_mission_little_isobelin_title:0 "Little Isobelin"
 isobelin_mission_little_isobelin_desc:0 "With the right to vote and hold property granted by the Isobelin City Council to the Jayek, and with the right to settle, hunt, fish and farm on Jayek lands granted to Cannorians by their chieftains, we have closer than brothers. Some have event taken to calling their main encampment on Isobel Island “Little Isobelin”. We should recognize this unity by bringing them under our banner and within our borders, so none will ever think to prey on them again."
 isobelin_mission_brothers_reunited_title:0 "Brothers Reunited"
 isobelin_mission_brothers_reunited_desc:0 "No one would have anticipated the extent to which the fortunes of the native Jayek has become tied to our own. They welcomed us with open arms, coming to our  aid during the first harsh winter on these shores, and in turn, our guns ward off death cultists and less scrupulous Cannorians from raiding their villages.\n\nThey tell us they were sundered from their people, ostracized when the Boek confederated, all but banished to these islands. That such could be done to so kind a people by those who proclaim themselves “brothers” is an injustice - and the Lady wills that justice be done."
 isobelin_mission_stronger_together_title:0 "Stronger Together"
 isobelin_mission_stronger_together_desc:0 "The new settler states on the Trollsbay differ from us in as many ways as we are similar. Our open embrace of all comers stands in contrast to our standoffish neighbors in Thilvis and Zanlib, and the almost leechlike gentry of Marlliande could not be more different from the freedom fighters of Valorpoint. However, we do share common threats, from the ascendant and belligerent Star Elves, to the hulking great power of Lorent. We should set aside our differences for time being to further the goal of common defense."
 isobelin_mission_divert_trade_from_the_interior_title:0 "Divert Trade from the Interior"
 isobelin_mission_divert_trade_from_the_interior_desc:0 "Even though we control the Ynn at its mouth, our growing city sees only a fraction of the commerce from the vast territories in the interior of the continent. By exerting our influence beyond the Cliffs of Ruin, we may ensure that more of the trade from the Ynn is diverted to the Lady Isobel, finding its way to the sea through our ports."
 isobelin_mission_isobelin_stock_exchange_title:0 "The Stock Exchange"
 isobelin_mission_isobelin_stock_exchange_desc:0 "No one can deny that our city is the financial capital of the New World. Bills of exchange and foreign coinage and of every sort change hands in our market stalls and back offices at a dizzying pace, and stocks and loans are issued nearly as fast as they can be put to paper. Like a raging river, this commercial chaos should be channeled into a more manageable and productive form, from which all can profit: a singular stock exchange, magnificent to behold, in a place of honor at the head of Tower Street."
 isobelin_mission_the_port_authority_title:0 "The Port Authority"
 isobelin_mission_the_port_authority_desc:0 "With wooden masts of merchant ships nearly blotting out the city behind them, one could easily mistake the harbor for a forest. Isobelin is the port of call for countless ships plying the waters of the New World. However, more than a few unscrupulous captains lay their plank at our docks. To combat smuggling and the skirting of harbor fees, we should empower the harbormaster with a new authority, and the arms to enforce it."

 isobelin_mission_the_isobelin_tribune_title:0 "Start Spreading the News"
 isobelin_mission_the_isobelin_tribune_desc:0 "A city runs on gossip: where to get the best deal on a loaf of bread, which landlords are offering the cheapest rent, who the officers in the Republican Guard are easiest to strike a deal with so your “non-regulatory” goods can find their way to the stalls on Tower Street. At the same time, our cosmopolitan city thrives with news from abroad, as immigrants are eager to hear news from home. Already, a bustling print industry has spawned several contenders to serve these needs, from the stodgy mainstay Lady’s Tribune, to the salacious Trollsbay Crier, to the stockbroker’s favorite Tower Street Times. So long as they do not engender lawlessness, we should promote these entrepreneurial journalistic efforts."

 isobelin_mission_from_the_rivers_to_the_bay_desc:0 "REPLACE_ME"
 isobelin_mission_black_on_black_in_little_bulwar_title:0 "Black on Black in Little Bulwar"
 isobelin_mission_black_on_black_in_little_bulwar_desc:0 "Our country and city is maritime at heart. The curt and coarse speech of sailors slips into everyday vernacular, their speedy and swaggering walk sets the pace for the city streets, and the handsome black coats and trousers of the navy have become the daywear of every self-respecting Isobeliner. The clothiers of Little Bulwar have apparently discovered a way to weave and dye black cloth on a grand scale, which may be cut to clothing of any fit in the Garment Quarter. We should encourage this industry, both for profit and our undeniable sense of fashion."
 isobelin_mission_the_five_wards_title:0 "Five Wards, One City"
 isobelin_mission_the_five_wards_desc:0 "The Island, the Port, Jayekmoot, Smallmouth, Trasilden. Although each has had their own municipal history and identity, they have steadily grown together over the decades. These petty bureaucratic differences must be swept aside. The five are each fingers of one hand, to be opened to the world or closed into a fist."
 isobelin_mission_the_garment_quarter_title:0 "The Garment Quarter"
 isobelin_mission_the_garment_quarter_desc:0 "While the initial coterie of elvish clothiers was focused solely on the elaborate costumes for the Thornsway theaters, the more enterprising ones expanded the scope of their business to fine clothing for the merchant elite of our city. Their apprentices and children followed in their footsteps, but not all were able to break into the luxury market, settling for making fetching but affordable wear for clerks, civil servants, and others who work with their minds, and sturdy but handsome wear for laborers and those that work with their hands. This garment industry, clustered in Elven Quarter, has given that neighborhood a second name. With the proper encouragement from the city government, our style shall be the envy of the world."

 isobelin_mission_thornsway_title:0 "Thornsway"
 isobelin_mission_thornsway_desc:0 "Built atop an old Jayek hunting trail running from one end of Isobel Island to the other, Thornsway has become synonymous with the spirit of the growing city: loud, exaggerated, filled to the brim and overflowing with life. An avenue of bright lights and shady people, rich planters and merchants being entertained by thespians on the stage, and courtesans in the bordello - often, indeed, the same entertainer. All trades are welcome, so long as they pay their taxes and present their proper permits. Thornsway serves as the first stop for many new arrivals from Cannor on a tour of the New World. The open purses of these so-called “tourists” may serve as a rich source of potential revenues."
 isobelin_mission_the_stacks_title:0 "The Stacks"
 isobelin_mission_the_stacks_desc:0 "With their little feet pattering down the gang planks of the quaint, charming boats that ferried them from Viswall and Beepeck, some newly arrived have brought us a novel architectural innovation along with barrels of tobacco and salted pork. With the prime lots on Isobel Island already claimed and under development, they have set to work on marginal land. Without the space to build out, they have started to build up, stacking one house on top of another. These “stacks”, as the neighborhood is now called, might be replicated in other parts of the city where land is becoming scarce - with bigger doors and taller ceilings, of course."
 isobelin_mission_bring_the_hyenas_to_heel_title:0 "Bring the Hyenas to Heel"
 isobelin_mission_bring_the_hyenas_to_heel_desc:0 "Long the terrors of the Divenhal, gnoll pirates were an infrequent but dreaded threat in our Esteemed Widow’s native Toarnaire. It seems like these demon-worshipers have crossed the ocean in their so-called Scourge Fleet to ply their vile trade on the waves of the Ruin Sea. Some of them have had the boldness to assert rights under the Charter to commerce and settlement in Isobelin. A small gnoll quarter has settled into the darker corners around the North Docks, and with them, a spike in smuggling and the sale and use of illicit, demonic intoxicants. The situation will soon be out of control, and voices in the city council are calling for a punitive expedition against the buccaneers. Other Trollsbay settlers, particularly those from Bulwar, may help us put these currs in their place."

 isobelin_mission_the_question_of_slavery_title:0 "The Question of Slavery"
 isobelin_mission_the_question_of_slavery_desc:0 "Slavery has long stood as a contradiction at the heart of Isobelin. A city founded on the premise of everyone having rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of wealth, whose commercial heart beats with the blood of those bound in chains. A generation ago, a half-orc could hope to rise only to the level of a gardener or a stevedore, whereas now they may be the greengrocer or the harbormaster - yet their distant cousins pass by their docks and storefronts shackled and doomed to lives of misery and servitude.\n\nA question has grown in volume, from whispers in the taverns of the Bridge District to the headlines of the Lady’s Tribune. What is right and what is wrong - the right to liberty, or the right to profit?"

 flavor_isobelin.100.t:0 "The Islanders"
 flavor_isobelin.100.d:0 "As we have settled the coast of these new lands, our relationship with native Jayek has become one of mutual aid, respect, and admiration. The first winter after we made our landing was harsh, with cruel winds toppling our wooden sheds and fences, and strange voices in the air stalking our dreams. The Jayek showed us the clefts and dells in the Island’s hills where we could keep our livestock safe and warm, and gave us a strong hot brew of chocolate to return peace to our sleep. The next summer, as many of their number were laid low with sickness, we tended to their crops, shared the bounty of game, and offered what knowledge of healing we could. Our shared struggles during the first year in this new land set the pattern in our relationship.\n\nThis pattern has not been followed by our fellow settlers from Cannor. Indeed, some have bound the natives in shackles and chains and set them to labor in the fields. We fear that if not under our official protection, our friends the Jayek will be subject to the same depredations. We should extend to them an offer - we shall keep them safe, and they will sew their threads into the tapestry of Isobelin we are weaving."
