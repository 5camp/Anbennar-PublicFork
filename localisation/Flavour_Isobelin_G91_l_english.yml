 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_river_title:0 "The Lady’s River"
 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_river_desc:0 "The explorers, traders, and unruly adventurers departing from the docks of Isobel Island to find their fortunes inland have taken to calling the river up which they sail the Lady Isobel. The report lands that may be put to good use supporting a growing city. By sponsoring our own expeditions to chart, claim, and settle the lands adjoining the Lady’s River, we can make this true in more than name only."
 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_landing_title:0 "The Lady’s Landing"
 isobelin_mission_the_ladys_landing_desc:0 "We have had the fortune of landing on a stretch of Aelantir’s coast positively brimming with opportunities: an archipelago of islands with deep natural harbors, fields ripe for planting on the mainland, and a wide river that beckons us to the interior. We must seize this opportunity before other arrivals from the Old World snatch it up."
 isobelin_mission_the_dream_of_a_city_title:0 "The Dream of a City"
 isobelin_mission_the_dream_of_a_city_desc:0 "“A fortnight past our entrance to the Ruinous Sea, we beheld the Island, cresting over the tides, as a dream of dawn crests over a night of terrors.”\n- From the Journal of Lady Isobel\n\nFrom the Lilac Wars, Greentide, and Age of Cinders, to the new conflicts bubbling below the surface, the cities of Cannor and Bulwar have known nothing but fire and death at the hands of monsters and petty men, often one and the same. Here, in this new land, we have a chance to plant the seed of a new city away from the wreckage of our homelands, a rose whose bloom shall be the envy of the whole world, a dream made manifest."
 isobelin_mission_fort_and_walkway_title:0 "Fort and Walkway"
 isobelin_mission_fort_and_walkway_desc:0 "Commerce must flow from the lands beyond the Cliffs of Ruin for our city to blossom. Already plans have been drawn up for a grand walkway, bedecked with all manner of plantlife, traversing the natural passage where the Lady Isobel meets the cliffs. And just as the most beautiful rose needs thorns to protect it, we have broken for a stronghold to secure the walkway from threats from above and below."
 isobelin_mission_a_rose_garden_in_the_swampland_title:0 "A Garden in a Swamp"
 isobelin_mission_a_rose_garden_in_the_swampland_desc:0 "We find ourselves far away from the verdant vineyards of Lencenor, amongst strange landscapes. The Trollsmaw Swamp, teeming with life, may offer fertile ground to transplant Cannorian flora. Indeed, some recently arrived transmuters from the Magesterium have claimed that a clever use of the plant growth spell may create not just a lush rose garden, but even enhance the defenses of the Fort itself, ensconcing the walls and towers with giant vines that can whip their thorns at would be attackers."
 isobelin_mission_control_the_troll_toll_title:0 "Control the Troll Toll"
 isobelin_mission_control_the_troll_toll_desc:0 "The islands of [1051.GetName] lie at the entrance of the Trollsbay, and are perfectly situated to collect a toll from ships passing into and out of the bay. Of course, any clever captain will seek to circumvent such a toll. To safeguard our commercial interests, and to ensure the rule of law - and therefore toll collection - is respected, we should establish a base on these islands and a fleet of ships capable of enforcing the Troll Toll."
 isobelin_mission_up_the_ynn_title:0 "Up the Ynn"
 isobelin_mission_up_the_ynn_desc:0 "By the reports of intrepid explorers stopping in Port Isobel, the Ynn is truly massive, its watershed stretching across the entire continent, making our Lady’s River seem like a pleasant brook in comparison. They report an frightful, eerie feeling from the swamp at the river’s mouth, as if the water were speaking to them, but most brave it to reach the riches beyond the Cliffs. We must control this passage into the interior if we are to dominate the commerce of the Trollsbay."
 isobelin_mission_isobels_will_title:0 "The Widow’s Will"
 isobelin_mission_isobels_will_desc:0 "Upon her passing, the Esteemed Widow has left us not just the remainder of her considerable fortune, but parting words of wisdom: true freedom for all is to be found when all submit to the rule of law. Although this ideal is hard to imagine in the chaotic wake of a century of catastrophes - the Greentide, the Lilac Wars, the Crimson Deluge - it is one which shall be a guiding light as we build our city."
 isobelin_mission_found_mawgate_prison_title:0 "Found Mawgate Prison"
 isobelin_mission_found_mawgate_prison_desc:0 "Theft, brawls, public drunkenness, and worse: Isobelin faces the same crimes and disorder as any other fast growing colony brimming with opportunity. However, if we hew to our founding ideals, we must not settle for mere frontier justice. We should establish courts of law, and a prison for those who have been found guilty can serve their sentences. A rocky island in the middle of the River at the entrance of the Trollsmaw Swamp may be a prime location."
 isobelin_mission_cultivate_cult_contacts_title:0 "Cultivate Cult Contacts"
 isobelin_mission_cultivate_cult_contacts_desc:0 "The Cheshoshi certainly made an impression when they first appeared at the periphery of our settlements, their skin tattooed pitch black, terrifying and angering our friends among the Jayek. It soon became clear that although they worshiped death, plenty of them still wanted to make a living - as mercenaries, they could hold their own against both Cannorians and ruinborn alike, and for a reasonable price. Deepening this commercial relationship and expanding into their southern markets could prove to be immensely profitable, if distasteful to some of our citizens."
 isobelin_mission_tower_street_title:0 "Tower Street"
 isobelin_mission_tower_street_desc:0 "Among the first permanent buildings we constructed on Isobel Island was a lighthouse to guide ships into port. Soon, market stalls sprung up around it, and one of the main thoroughfares of the Island snaked its way away from it. Tower Street has quickly become synonymous with the bustling commercial life of our growing city. Everything can be bought, sold, bartered (and occasionally stolen) here from swords and shields, to Roilsardi wine, to hulking orcs bound in shackles. We should cement our leading role as Trollsbay’s premier center of commerce by expanding and bringing order to Tower Street."
 isobelin_mission_jayek_bridge_title:0 "The Twin Bridges"
 isobelin_mission_jayek_bridge_desc:0 "We have begun to build roads over the hunting trails lacing through Isobel Island cut by the Jayek long ago, but transportation between the archipelago and the mainland is limited to ferries and other small watercraft, hindering our development and leaving our citizens and their goods vulnerable to pirates. Fortuitously, a new dwarf arrival from Menibór has drawn up an ambitious proposal modeled on his people’s masterful bridgebuilding over the Luna: twin bridges of rock and iron, connecting Jayekmoot to Isobel Island, and Isobel Island to the mainland."
 isobelin_mission_city_hall_title:0 "Isobelin City Hall"
 isobelin_mission_city_hall_desc:0 "As our city has developed, political fractures have started to emerge, and old tensions find life in the new world. The Roilsardi who originally accompanied the Widow across the sea wish to preserve their privileged positions, while new arrivals from Anbennar, Lencenor, and Bulwar are fighting to ensure they have a place in the city. Some amount of conflict is necessary for a state’s continued vitality, but not so much that it threatens to boil over into the streets. We should establish both physical and political structures to ensure that this enriches Isobelin with reasoned debate, rather than compromise it through mindless bloodshed."
 isobelin_mission_the_navy_yard_title:0 "The Navy Yard"
 isobelin_mission_the_navy_yard_desc:0 "From great galleons filled with dreamers from Cannor seeking new shores, to simple dinghies with their simple fishermen seeking today’s catch, ships are the lifeblood of our city. A great number are in need of repair and refitting after making the perilous journey across the ocean. Having a dedicated shipyard would make Isobelin the maritime hub for the whole Trollsbay, and would also give us the facilities to construct our own fleet for war and commerce."
 isobelin_mission_an_awakening_city_title:0 "An Awakening City"
 isobelin_mission_an_awakening_city_desc:0 "Insults, followed by shouts, followed by hands reaching for daggers, as a half-orc laborer street sweeper and a well-dressed Roilsardi aristocrat bump shoulders on Tower Street - halted by the arrival of a stern patrolman of the Republican Guard. Coins clinking on a table in a nearby in a cramped counting house, as a local merchant concludes an exchange with her counterpart from Vertesk - twenty bales of cotton and a precious artifact from the Precursor Elves, for twelve kegs of Varainéy gunpowder, and nine shackled orcs from Escann. Down the road, nails hammering into beams as a gregarious Brasani carpenter and his taciturn Jayek apprentice raise a new addition to an already haphazard tenement. The sounds of a city stirring, as Isobelin awakes."
 isobelin_mission_rehabilitate_the_ruinborn_title:0 "Rehabilitate the Ruinborn"
 isobelin_mission_rehabilitate_the_ruinborn_desc:0 "“Written on their very faces was ruin, and while their visages brought bats and beasts to mind, their hearts were love-filled just as ours. Pity, these creatures need, not revulsion.”\n-The Journal of Lady Isobel\n\nOur Lady landed on these shores with a dream of a home for all, united under the law, with the promise of flourishing through hard work and self-betterment. This promise should be available not just to new arrivals like us, but to those who lived on these shores when we landed. The Jayek have shown their worth ten times over. We should help them elevate themselves to their highest potential."
 isobelin_mission_the_twin_batteries_title:0 "The Twin Batteries"
 isobelin_mission_the_twin_batteries_desc:0 "Almost as soon as we planted our flag on Isobel Island, we moved quickly to establish an outpost across the bay. While this stretch of mainland does not offer the same deep water harbors as the Island, it serves as a vital ferry terminal for goods and people traveling to the interior. It is necessary for the growth of the city that we secure the mouth of the Lady’s River against raids by sea and by land by constructing twin batteries facing east and west."
 isobelin_mission_little_isobelin_title:0 "Little Isobelin"
 isobelin_mission_little_isobelin_desc:0 "With the right to vote and hold property granted by the Isobelin City Council to the Jayek, and with the right to settle, hunt, fish and farm on Jayek lands granted to Cannorians by their chieftains, we have closer than brothers. Some have event taken to calling their main encampment on Isobel Island “Little Isobelin”. We should recognize this unity by bringing them under our banner and within our borders, so none will ever think to prey on them again."
 isobelin_mission_brothers_reunited_title:0 "Brothers Reunited"
 isobelin_mission_brothers_reunited_desc:0 "No one would have anticipated the extent to which the fortunes of the native Jayek has become tied to our own. They welcomed us with open arms, coming to our  aid during the first harsh winter on these shores, and in turn, our guns ward off death cultists and less scrupulous Cannorians from raiding their villages.\n\nThey tell us they were sundered from their people, ostracized when the Boek confederated, all but banished to these islands. That such could be done to so kind a people by those who proclaim themselves “brothers” is an injustice - and the Lady wills that justice be done."
 isobelin_mission_stronger_together_title:0 "Stronger Together"
 isobelin_mission_stronger_together_desc:0 "The new settler states on the Trollsbay differ from us in as many ways as we are similar. Our open embrace of all comers stands in contrast to our standoffish neighbors in Thilvis and Zanlib, and the almost leechlike gentry of Marlliande could not be more different from the freedom fighters of Valorpoint. However, we do share common threats, from the ascendant and belligerent Star Elves, to the hulking great power of Lorent. We should set aside our differences for time being to further the goal of common defense."
 isobelin_mission_divert_trade_from_the_interior_title:0 "Upriver Isobelin"
 isobelin_mission_divert_trade_from_the_interior_desc:0 "Compared to the unnerving and dismal fens and bogs around Ynnsmouth, the charming marshes and lush glades of the Trollsmaw offer a tranquil escape from Port Isobel for those who can afford a country manor on some of the newly cleared land. Indeed, so many transplants from the city have arrived that some refer to it as Upriver Isobelin. This development can be furthered by sending trade that otherwise might flow down the Ynn to the Lady Isobel."
 isobelin_mission_isobelin_stock_exchange_title:0 "The Stock Exchange"
 isobelin_mission_isobelin_stock_exchange_desc:0 "No one can deny that our city is the financial capital of the New World. Bills of exchange and foreign coinage and of every sort change hands in our market stalls and back offices at a dizzying pace, and stocks and loans are issued nearly as fast as they can be put to paper. Like a raging river, this commercial chaos should be channeled into a more manageable and productive form, from which all can profit: a singular stock exchange, magnificent to behold, in a place of honor at the head of Tower Street."
 isobelin_mission_the_port_authority_title:0 "The Port Authority"
 isobelin_mission_the_port_authority_desc:0 "With wooden masts of merchant ships nearly blotting out the city behind them, one could easily mistake the harbor for a forest. Isobelin is the port of call for countless ships plying the waters of the New World. However, more than a few unscrupulous captains lay their plank at our docks. To combat smuggling and the skirting of harbor fees, we should empower the harbormaster with a new authority, and the arms to enforce it."
 isobelin_mission_hostile_takeover_title:0 "Hostile Takeover"
 isobelin_mission_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "The Derrane and Calassani Trade Companies, as well as a self-governing and militarized branch of the Asra Bank, lay claim to numerous islands and trading posts across the Ruined Sea, draining the Trollsbay and North Aelantir of its wealth. To secure our rightful place of financial dominance, these middlemen for Cannorian commercial interests must be dispatched."
 isobelin_mission_crashing_the_concord_title:0 "Crashing the Concord"
 isobelin_mission_crashing_the_concord_desc:0 "Money makes the world go ‘round, and if there is a center of financial gravity around which the Trollsbay spins, it is the halls of Isobelin’s Stock Exchange. Our stockbrokers have broad and deep investments across the Trollsbay: Cestirmark timber companies, Marlliande plantations, Valorpoint wyvern-forges, Thílvisian dye manufacturers, Zanlibi printing presses. Some in the Stock Exchange and in City Hall have started asking if we should: if we have bought their economies wholesale, why should we not own the rest? The temporary political chaos this would cause our neighbors would be in their best long-term interests."
 isobelin_mission_a_concord_united_title:0 "The Concord United"
 isobelin_mission_a_concord_united_desc:0 "When Cestirmark’s founder Varil sína Cymainé wrote to Lady Isobel suggesting they put aside their differences and work together for the greater good, she dismissed him as “a small man with small glasses that tries to compensate with the scope of his ideas". She was correct about the man, but his idea may be worthwhile to revisit. Bringing together the different peoples of Trollsbay under one government and one law may be the best way to ensure our mutual protection and prosperity. As the melting pot of Aelantir, it is natural that we should lead such a Concord."
 isobelin_mission_the_isobelin_tribune_title:0 "Start Spreading the News"
 isobelin_mission_the_isobelin_tribune_desc:0 "A city runs on gossip: where’s the best deal on a loaf of bread, which landlords offer the cheapest rent, which officers in the Republican Guard are easiest to strike a deal with so your “non-regulatory” goods can get to market. Our cosmopolitan city thrives with news from abroad, as immigrants are eager to hear the latest from home. A bustling print industry has spawned several contenders to serve these needs, from the stodgy mainstay Lady’s Tribune, to the salacious Trollsbay Crier, to the stockbroker’s favorite Tower Street Times. So long as they do not engender lawlessness, we should promote these entrepreneurial journalistic efforts."
 isobelin_mission_from_the_rivers_to_the_bay_title:0 "Yoking the Ynn"
 isobelin_mission_from_the_rivers_to_the_bay_desc:0 "Even though we control the Ynn at its mouth, our growing city sees only a fraction of the commerce from the vast territories in the interior of the continent. By exerting our influence beyond the Cliffs of Ruin, we may ensure that more of the Ynn’s trade is diverted to the Lady Isobel, finding its way to and from the sea through Port Isobel, where we can collect our toll."
 isobelin_mission_black_on_black_in_little_bulwar_title:0 "Black on Black in Little Bulwar"
 isobelin_mission_black_on_black_in_little_bulwar_desc:0 "Our country and city is maritime at heart. The curt and coarse speech of sailors slips into everyday vernacular, their speedy and swaggering walk sets the pace for the city streets, and the handsome black coats and trousers of the navy have become the daywear of every self-respecting Isobeliner. The clothiers of Little Bulwar have apparently discovered a way to weave and dye black cloth on a grand scale, which may be cut to clothing of any fit in the Garment Quarter. We should encourage this industry, both for profit and our undeniable sense of fashion."
 isobelin_mission_the_five_wards_title:0 "Five Wards, One City"
 isobelin_mission_the_five_wards_desc:0 "The Island, the Port, Jayekmoot, Smallmouth, Trasilden. Although each has had their own municipal history and identity, they have steadily grown together over the decades. These petty bureaucratic differences must be swept aside. The five are each fingers of one hand, to be opened to the world or closed into a fist."
 isobelin_mission_the_garment_quarter_title:0 "The Garment Quarter"
 isobelin_mission_the_garment_quarter_desc:0 "While the initial coterie of elvish clothiers was focused solely on the elaborate costumes for the Thornsway theaters, the more enterprising ones expanded the scope of their business to fine clothing for the merchant elite of our city. Their apprentices and children followed in their footsteps, but not all were able to break into the luxury market, settling for making fetching but affordable wear for clerks, civil servants, and others who work with their minds, and sturdy but handsome wear for laborers and those that work with their hands. This garment industry, clustered in Elven Quarter, has given that neighborhood a second name. With the proper encouragement from the city government, our style shall be the envy of the world."
 isobelin_mission_the_jaybean_roastery_title:0 "The Jaybean Roastery"
 isobelin_mission_the_jaybean_roastery_desc:0 "Our citizens bustle to and fro, never having enough minutes in the hour or hours in the day, shunning sleep in pursuit of their dreams. A fortunate turn of fate has facilitated this. Our friends the Jayek have long cultivated the beans of the Dark Beverage, with a potent brewing style strong enough to keep the most frenetic Isobeliner up all night. We should make every effort to ensure that no Isobeliner goes without their beloved Cup of Jay."
 isobelin_mission_an_arising_city_title:0 "An Arising City"
 isobelin_mission_an_arising_city_desc:0 "The tang of sweat, pitch, and salted fish as a crew of half-orc longshoremen break bulk on a two-master from Rivsby. The acrid aroma of an over-brewed cup of jay from a cheap street vendor, hastily gulped down by an apprentice broker hustling to the Stock Exchange. Paint fumes and choking sawdust billowing over a Thornsway stage, as its harried director curses the craftsmen’s imperfect execution of her dazzling vision.\n\nFor some, an enchanting fragrance, and others, an odious odor: the smells of an arising city, taking in the first breath of a new day."
 isobelin_mission_the_racks_title:0 "The Racks"
 isobelin_mission_the_racks_desc:0 "Isobelin’s halflings, like all the denizens in our city, are hustlers and strivers. Some, despite their short stature, have reached the height of wealth and prestige, and have set their sights beyond the cramped tenements of the Stacks where their forebears first set up. They have begun to move across the straights, settling into a suburban community on the banks of the aptly named Smallmouth, known for the many drying racks of their favorite tobaccos. Here, they can remain close to the city, but enjoy the country life of old, with full pipes and full bellies. We should ensure that The Racks remain tied to the city proper, and the taxable wealth does not get squirreled away in their hidey-holes."
 isobelin_mission_thornsway_title:0 "Thornsway"
 isobelin_mission_thornsway_desc:0 "Built atop an old Jayek hunting trail running from one end of Isobel Island to the other, Thornsway has become synonymous with the spirit of the growing city: loud, exaggerated, filled to the brim and overflowing with life. An avenue of bright lights and shady people, rich planters and merchants being entertained by thespians on the stage, and courtesans in the bordello - often, indeed, the same entertainer. All trades are welcome, so long as they pay their taxes and present their proper permits. Thornsway serves as the first stop for many new arrivals from Cannor on a tour of the New World. The open purses of these so-called “tourists” may serve as a rich source of potential revenues."
 isobelin_mission_the_stacks_title:0 "The Stacks"
 isobelin_mission_the_stacks_desc:0 "With their little hairy feet pattering down the gang planks of the quaint, charming boats that ferried them from Viswall and Beepeck, some newly arrived halflings have brought us a novel architectural innovation along with barrels of tobacco and salted pork. With the prime lots on Isobel Island already claimed and under development, they have set to work on marginal land. Without the space to build out, they have started to build up, stacking one house on top of another. These “stacks”, as the neighborhood is now called, might be replicated in other parts of the city where land is becoming scarce - with bigger doors and taller ceilings, of course."
 isobelin_mission_bring_the_hyenas_to_heel_title:0 "Bring the Hyenas to Heel"
 isobelin_mission_bring_the_hyenas_to_heel_desc:0 "Long the terrors of the Divenhal, gnoll pirates were an infrequent but dreaded threat in our Esteemed Widow’s native Toarnaire. These demon-worshipers have crossed the ocean in their so-called Scourge Fleet to ply their vile trade in the Ruin Sea. Some have even had the boldness to claim rights under the Charter to commerce and settlement in Isobelin. A small gnoll quarter has settled into the darker corners around the North Docks, and with them, a spike in smuggling and the sale and use of illicit, demonic intoxicants. The situation will soon be out of control, and voices in the city council are calling for a punitive expedition against the buccaneers. Other Trollsbay settlers, particularly those from Bulwar, may help us put these curs in their place."
 isobelin_mission_dueling_veridicals_title:0 "Dueling Archprovosts"
 isobelin_mission_dueling_veridicals_desc:0 "As the largest city in the Trollsbay, Port Isobel should be the natural choice for the chief seat of Ravelianism in the region. However, the far less significant city of Vincenton across the bay also holds itself as such, on the basis of their longer history as Ravelians. Obviously, this contradiction cannot stand. A fair compromise would be to grant a veridical seat for both Isobel Island and the mainland district, to recognize our preeminence. We should dispatch an emissary to the High Rectorate to make this request."
 isobelin_mission_the_question_of_slavery_title:0 "The Question of Slavery"
 isobelin_mission_the_question_of_slavery_desc:0 "Slavery has long stood as a contradiction at the heart of Isobelin. A city founded on the premise of everyone having rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of wealth, whose commercial heart beats with the blood of those bound in chains. A generation ago, a half-orc could hope to rise only to the level of a gardener or a longshoreman, whereas now they may be the greengrocer or the harbormaster - yet their distant cousins pass by their docks and storefronts shackled and doomed to lives of misery and servitude.\n\nA question has grown in volume, from whispers in the taverns of the Bridge District to the headlines of the Lady’s Tribune. What is right and what is wrong - the right to liberty, or the right to profit?"
 isobelin_mission_amalgamated_tinkerers_of_isobelin_title:0 "Amalgamated Tinkerers"
 isobelin_mission_amalgamated_tinkerers_of_isobelin_desc:0 "Guilds have been present in Isobelin since the first carpenter and adventurer stepped off the boat. And for just as long, apprentices and journeymen have resented their overbearing guildmasters. This tension in the newly established Artificer’s Guild has grown harder to ignore. “Tinkering, Not Toiling” is the call of the agitators, and already they have begun to exert power, laying down their tools en masse and refusing to work. It may be possible to prevent this conflict from turning violent by granting them some rights and protections, while not entirely upending the established order."
 isobelin_mission_roscolum_university_title:0 "Roscolum University"
 isobelin_mission_roscolum_university_desc:0 "As with all other aspects of the city, education in Isobelin has been a haphazard, frenetic melting pot. A dozen different languages can fill a given classroom, and lecturers from every corner of the world gather to vociferously debate. Many such lecturers came to Aelantir as their ideas and research did not fit into the norms of the Old World, and a group of them have gathered to give their research and teaching an institutional legitimacy. We should encourage this: the world’s greatest city deserves a university to match."
 isobelin_mission_a_wreath_of_roses_title:0 "Uprooting the City"
 isobelin_mission_a_wreath_of_roses_desc:0 "The Esteemed Widow dreamed of a city, and the one that has arisen since she passed is itself laid out with the twisting logic of a dream. Even native born Isobeliners get lost going from one side of the Island to another. A group of architects and civil servants have recently proposed an ambitious plan for a complete renewal, tearing out old weeds and planting a vibrant new city in their place. Such an enterprise will take many years, to say nothing of the cost - but there’s nothing an Isobeliner loves more than a chance to prove themselves up to a challenge."
 isobelin_mission_the_city_that_never_sleeps_title:0 "The City That Never Sleeps"
 isobelin_mission_the_city_that_never_sleeps_desc:0 "Darkness in the tunnel under Tower Street, broken with a burst as the Isobel Island Local emerges into Erel Station, the golden light of the setting sun streaming through the high arched windows. Next stop: the red brick-paved Concord Square, where amalgamated gnome glassworkers and dwarf masons rally to demand better wages and shorter hours. The tracks rise higher, above the blue slate rooftops of the Bridge District, where a gang of half-orc teenagers stop roughhousing for a moment to watch the sparkdrive locomotive hurtle overhead. A kaleidoscope of passengers scuttle between platforms at Thornsway Junction: born-and-bred Isobeliners dressed head to toe in black, Stock Exchangers in extravagant silks from the Garment Quarter out for a night at the theater, halflings in earth-toned farmwear commuting back to Smallmouth after selling their produce in the City.\n\nAs the sun goes down, lamps and torches alight, joining the Thorned Lady’s eternal flame. One sees that life in the city doesn’t slow with nightfall. It speeds up - the speed of all the people in it on the chase. One sees an unsleeping city full of wide-awake dreamers."
 isobelin_mission_the_widows_park_title:0 "The Widow’s Park"
 isobelin_mission_the_widows_park_desc:0 "As Isobel Island became covered from end to end in buildings and roads, a sight of green became a luxury. A backyard garden, or a private park glimpsed through a fence, was the best a common Isobeliner could hope for. To address this the Commissioner’s Plan calls for a great octagonal park to be planted at the very heart of the city, for the enjoyment and recreation of all citizens."
 isobelin_mission_the_thorned_lady_title:0 "The Thorned Lady"
 isobelin_mission_the_thorned_lady_desc:0 "In the centuries since Lady Isobel sailed from Tornaire, we have grown distinct from that city and forged our own identity outside the petty divisions of Lencenori and Anbennarian. However, the citizens there hold us in high regard, as distant kinsmen who have left home and achieved great things.\n\nA group of artisans and mages from Tornaire have written to us with the desire to gift to us a grand monument: the Esteemed Widow, two hundred feet tall, clad in bronze and crowned in silver thorns, carrying an eternal flame of a golden lamp to light the way to our shores."

 flavor_isobelin.100.t:0 "The Islanders"
 flavor_isobelin.100.d:0 "As we have settled the coast of these new lands, our relationship with native Jayek has become one of mutual aid, respect, and admiration. The first winter after we made our landing was harsh, with cruel winds toppling our wooden sheds and fences, and strange voices in the air stalking our dreams. The Jayek showed us the clefts and dells in the Island’s hills where we could keep our livestock safe and warm, and gave us a strong hot brew of chocolate to return peace to our sleep. The next summer, as many of their number were laid low with sickness, we tended to their crops, shared the bounty of game, and offered what knowledge of healing we could. Our shared struggles during the first year in this new land set the pattern in our relationship.\n\nThis pattern has not been followed by our fellow settlers from Cannor. Indeed, some have bound the natives in shackles and chains and set them to labor in the fields. We fear that if not under our official protection, our friends the Jayek will be subject to the same depredations. We should extend to them an offer - we shall keep them safe, and they will sew their threads into the tapestry of Isobelin we are weaving."

Buskers play lutes or flutes or sing for their supper. Wagon wheels groan under the weight of new goods fresh off the docks. One such commodity adds a new sound to the cacophony: the clink of chains, and the groans of captives chafing in their shackles.\n\nThe market-goers are momentarily silent as they watch the first slaves ever to be brought to the Tower Street auction blocks, prodded by a Vertesker overseer into pens shared with pigs and cattle. A child cries at the sight of the orcs in chains, and with that cue, the market resumes its gritty symphony, as if nothing strange or tragic had just happened. Added to the chorus are the slippery aristocratic drawl of a Marlliander merchant, bidding “ten crowns for the lot of brutes”, followed by the squeak of a competitor from Thílvis raising her five crowns more.\n\nFor the orcs standing silently amidst the noise, their proud warcries and boisterous songs around the campfire are a distant memory, their home back in Escann as out of reach as a dream upon waking, one dream in a city full of them."

 flavor_isobelin.107.d:0 "So long as they are served and served well, masters often overlook their servants’ personal lives. What the lowly do in their off hours is outside the scope of awareness or care for the high and mighty. In Isobelin, for example, the masters of enslaved orcs and indentured humans did not notice the bonds these two groups formed, brought together by circumstance and united in servitude. None would have predicted that these bonds would grow into love. From this love has sprung a new people.\n\nThese half-orcs, among first of their kind in Aelantir, were born free under the Charter of Rights but bound by the prejudice and poverty inherited from their forebears. Only the most menial and odious occupations were open to them: porters, tanners, sellswords, cutpurses, cooks, and gong farmers. Yet they proved themselves to be quintessential Isobeliners: striving, hustling, always reaching toward something greater than lowly origins."

 flavor_isobelin.109.d:0 "Bardur of the Riverstone Clan was born in Menibór near the turn of the 16th Century. A preternaturally gifted architect and engineer, he soon outgrew the opportunities in his home city. Distant kin in Silverforge arranged for a commission in the Silver Army Engineer Corps, where he honed his skill in both building and razing fortifications. It was across the sea where he made his personal fortune from the deep pockets of the Asra Bank. Designing and building the vault of their newly established branch in Asraport, his work was acclaimed for its pragmatic hardiness with an angular dwarven aesthetic flair. His contract was extended to enhancing the harbor’s novel lift and pulley system.\n\nBardur’s greatest works were to be built on a small, rocky island even further to the west, recently settled by Roilsardi led by a rich widow. In Isobelin, he found the place where he could materialize his dreams into stone and iron. Designing City Hall, re-engineering the works at Twin Batteries, and applying the lessons learned in Asraport to expand the Navy Yard, he left an indelible mark on these foundational institutions of the city.\n\nBut his crowning achievement was undoubtedly the Twin Bridges of Isobelin. True to his dwarven heritage, and despite his wide travels, he retained a lifelong distaste for boat rides, and desired more than anything to walk on solid stone from Isobel Island and Jayekmoot to mainland North Aelantir. Financed by loans from the city’s bankers, a municipal bond, and his own wealth, work began on two great bridges over the Jayek and Isobel Straights. Enslaved orcs did the bulk of the grueling, and dangerous work. Many drowned building and draining the cofferdams or were maimed raising the great blocks of masonry. Ten years later, two masterworks of granite and wrought iron rose from the water. The Twin Bridges were truly the first structures to distinguish Isobelin as a city unlike any other.\n\nRetiring at the age of 192, his family and business became as permanent a fixture in Isobelin as any edifice. Cannorian dwarves would brave the sea for the chance to apprentice at Bardur and Sons. Far from the Luna, his line was Clan Riverstone no longer. On the shores of Isobelin, Clan Bridgemaker arose."

One’s claim to power through bloodline or magical aptitude would not hold sway in Isobelin. Grit and determination would determine how high one could rise. Here, the rights jealously guarded by the elite few would be enjoyed by all - to pursue happiness and wealth in a fine new land. All born on Isobelin’s shores and those that came of their own free will would know this freedom.\n\nHowever, freedom without governance is chaos, and without being enshrined in a social contract, these liberties would wither away under pressure from the old order. In [GetYear], the City Council drafted a Charter of Rights, under direction from the Esteemed Widow. Memorialized in this document would be the rights Isobelin came to be known for, and which attracted thousands of immigrants from overseas suffering at the point of a warlord’s sword or the tip of a magician's wand. The right to settle the land, and conduct commerce and profit off of it. The right to participate in the life of the city, vote in elections, and to be free of the burdens and strictures of feudalism. The right to live as one’s own man or woman, of any race or religion, with equal protection under the law.\n\nOf course, those who broke these laws would lose these rights, swiftly and permanently. And those who arrived in Port Isobel not of their own will would receive vastly different treatment than those who did. In the Charter arose the tensions and contradictions that would define Isobelin’s internal political life."

With perfect fluency, he declared that he and his companions had come to Isobelin of their own free will, and claimed the right of settlement under the Charter.\n\nUncertain of what to do, the Captain of the Guard had them cuffed and led to the dockyard jail. Shortly, the bodies of the original crew were discovered below deck, with throttled throats and broken skulls. The ship’s logs detail its voyage to Marlliande, with a miserly captain, a skeleton crew, and over two hundred orcs in the hold, ending abruptly a week prior.\n\nThe Mayor’s decision to hold a trial over the mutineers’ claim to rights under the Charter sharply divided the city. Tower Street merchants objected to the trial in principle - cargo had no right to a day in court, let alone under the Charter. They demanded they be placed on the next ship bound for Marlliande, perhaps with a polite request that their expenses be covered. The growing half-orc community argued fervently that their rights to settlement and liberty were beyond dispute, as they came of their own free will. The violence done in their journey was justified - any reasonable person would seek to escape captivity, and defend oneself from one’s captors. Some suggested a middle ground - allow the orcs to stay in Isobelin, but as prisoners convicted of murder, bound to hard labor.

Four generations had passed since her family made landfall with the Remnant Fleet, settling in the Autumnglade in the Kingdom of Lorent. Her great-grandmother and namesake kept the sails of the Fleet in good repair, and her skill with cloth she passed to her descendants. The Skyweaver family’s ornate tapestries and rugs had found homes in the courts of Cannor for four centuries./n/nLeslindel, however, found her family’s comfortable, enduring routine stifling. Never once wielding a sword, she had an adventurer’s drive for new horizons. Apprenticing with the imaginative, almost whimsical clothiers of the Springlade, she developed an obsession with both clothing and theatricality. When she heard of a bustling metropolis on the shores of the Trollsbay, with a burgeoning, uproariously innovative theater scene with an insatiable demand for costumes, she quickly pilfered twenty bolts of silk from her family’s storehouse and make haste across the sea.\n\nThe House of Skyweaver faced few local competitors, and almost immediately theater directors took out personal loans to commission just a single piece of hers. Rich theater-goers followed suit. Young elves from the Redglades and beyond, adventurous but more comfortable wielding a needle than a sword, sailed to Isobelin to apprentice with her. A decade after she set up shop, her store on the mainland was the nucleus of a growing community of elves employed in fashion, tailoring, silk weaving, and the creative arts.\n\nOver time, her apprentices became competitors. Her life came to a characteristically dramatic end at the hand of one such jealous competitor, rumored to be a spurned lover. Her tremendous talent cut short by her lurid, salacious death at the young age of 96 made her remaining works sought after treasures - truly, no Isobeliner could be counted among the city’s rich without a Leslindel original in her closet."

Thus, the Escannis have no qualms clapping them in chains and sending them down the Alen to the Black Tower, to be sold like so many bushels of wheat. Most of our citizens bear little towards them, and many have made quite a tidy sum trading in them as a commodity or using their labor. But in their sojourn on our shores, they have proven that an orc can have just as much the spirit of striving, of chasing dreams of a better future, as any human or elf or dwarf who finds themselves in our City.\n\nNone more so than the fabled Thorn Tusks. Zanbar the Black purchased them as shock troops for the punitive expedition against Myxk, promising good rations, sturdy weapons, and clean clothing. If they brought him twenty gnoll ears, they would earn a cabin boy’s wages, and after fifty, manumission. Wrapping barbed metal wire around their tusks, they fell on the corsair galleons in battle after battle. In one engagement with the Scourge Fleet, they boarded and captured twelve ships in two hours. Hundreds of dog ears fell at the feet of a smiling Zanbar. Their shackles fell too, and Port Isobel greeted them with cheers on their return.\n\nSome chose to use their new freedom and earned wages to set up homesteads up the Lady’s River, or open small shops in the Bridge District. But many chose to return for another tour in the military as freed citizens in the Thorn Tusk Brigade. They kept the barbed wire as part of their uniform, but earned a new reputation for themselves - soldiers, fearsome and disciplined."

Spending ten long years learning pirate-craft from the same brigands, he bided his time, until the moment was ripe for mutiny. Slitting the throat of every last gnoll and dumping their bodies overboard, he himself then hoisted the black sail.\n\nDressed all in black, he earned a fearsome but principled reputation, taking ships belonging to Cannorians and gnolls, never fellow Aelantiri.

However, when one hundred of those seven foot tall tiger-men disembarked from a Yansheni junk, resplendent in flowing orange robes and carrying quarterstaffs, even the most seasoned Isobeliner found it a peculiar sight. When questioned by the Harbormaster, they explained through an interpreter that members of the Trollsbay Museum expedition to Haless had told them of our city and our open doors, and of the martial prowess of the Jayek Braves. Calling themselves monks, they wished to test themselves against these fearsome warriors in ritualized sparring.\n\nThe Jayek, true to their long-held hospitality, allowed them to construct a monastery on Jayekmoot, and younger Braves and daring non-ruinborn stepped forward to learn their ways, earning many black eyes and broken teeth in the process. Soon, other monks from the mysterious land of Xia arrived, including harpies and gold-scaled kobolds. They came to be known as the Wudikmen Clan, a misnomer, as they were not a clan but a school, and came from many temples other than Wudikmen.\n\nAcross the Jayek Straight on Isobel Island, the children of these monks who did not wish to follow their parents' discipline established Little Yanshen. Isobeliners from all over the city flocked to its cramped, winding streets for cheap and delicious cuisine, and baubles and trinkets from across the Ocean of the Lost."
