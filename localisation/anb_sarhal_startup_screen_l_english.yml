 string_start_kheterata:0 "§OPrimer§!\n§YKheterata§! holds itself as the eldest civilization in all of the world, save perhaps a few dwarven remnants sulking in their caves, with a legacy tracing back to the time when even §YCastanor§! had yet to be born. It is a land dominated by the legacy of its divine founder and his children, Elikhet and the Khet, yet ruled by mere mortals - even Elikhet, for all his might and glory, often placed human friends on the throne of Kheterata rather than always sit upon it himself.\n\nThe blessing of the Sorrow, the magical river created by Elikhet at the height of his power and invested with much of his divine might, is the center of Kheteratan civilization - creating a bountiful, fertile heartland for the Kheteratans protected from all foes by miles upon miles of desert to the east and west. Though eventually this protection would fail in the face of gnollish and later Damerian conquests, these were always overthrown eventually and Kheterata returned to its rightful state of self-rule, even if - as in the case of the Damerians - Elikhet himself had to rise from the dead to see it done.\n\nKheterata is dominated by the metropolitan §YKheteratan§! culture; born from the intermarriage of Elikhet's Bulwari followers and the native §YShasoura§! nomads of the Salahad who still dominate the east. Over time, Kheteratan culture has been influenced by many now-dead cultures, primarily through slaves and bondsmen who earned their freedom; the strongest legacies have been left by the §YMilcori§!, a people from what is now §YArannen§!, and the thousand ancestor tribes of the §YBahari§! and §YBusilari§!.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nRule over §YKheterata§! would eventually be granted to the Crodamos dynasty of Akan, who would maintain it even after losing Akan itself. This would change when the Sun Elf Jaher arrived in Kheterata following his conquest of Bulwar, as he would so charm the Khetarch Baqtkhet I that he mandated that Kheterata would enter an alliance with Jaher's empire and promised to crown him as King of Kheterata on the death of the human King at the time.\n\nThen the unexpected happened; the King of Kheterata outlived Jaher. This left Kheterata in a state of chaos; the Crodamos dynasty no longer held the support of the Khet, the Khetarch abandoned any semblance of leadership in favor of open hedonism, and Jaher's heir, Jexis, began a conquest of Kheterata with the permission of the apathetic Khetarch.\n\nThe Sun Elf occupation ended with the death of Baqtkhet I in 1160 and of Jexis in 1162. A new alliance was established between Khetarch Baqtkhet II and the Crodamos dynasty, while the gnolls of the south began a period of expansion that reached its climax in 1442 with the conquest of the south Sorrow by Grizaka Emperor-of-Gnollkind. Interpreted as a sign of royal weakness by many, a priestly rebellion in Nirat and the renewed Sun Elf expansionism of Elizna now threaten Crodamic rule."
 string_start_title_nirat:0 "Nirat, Bulwark of the Faithful"
 string_start_nirat:0 "§OPrimer§!\n§YNirat§!, the Temple of the Resurrection, is the center of a rebellion of the faithful against the Crodamic rulers of §YKheterata§!. Two figures lead the rebellion; §YHigh Priest Nahab the Defiant§! and §YCommander Dajasht the Dashing§!. Though they remain firm allies until the Crodamos have been toppled, already division shows its face between the ultratraditionalist priests of Nahab and the messianic soldiers of Dajasht.\n\nThe clerical ultratraditionalists believe that Kheterata has fallen into sin due to a failure to strictly abide by the taboos of Elikhet; only by crushing the decadent nobility and restoring power to the Khetarch, as was clearly intended, can this spiritual sickness be excised from Kheterata. However, concerned as they are with higher matters, it falls to Nahab - the greatest servant of the Khetarchy - to act in their place.\n\nThe messianic Dajashti army identifies a different source of Kheterata's weakness:  the influence of foreigners, foremost among them the Damerian dogs of the House of Crodamos. Only by the full assimilation of such elements, and a return to pure §YKheteratan§! culture, can the Kingdom regain it's rightful place as first among nations - and it falls to Dajasht, once a simple courier, to restore Kheteratan rule from Ekha in the west to Eduz-Vacyn in the east; from Busilar in the north to Kunolo in the south!\n\n§ORecent History§!\nBorn out of frustration towards Crodamic weakness, as well as the open corruption of much of the Kheteratan upper class, the rebellion has seized much of the central Sorrow and successfully cut Kheterat off from the coast of the Divenhal. With such a bold move crippling the already-weak Kings of the House of Crodamos, a final war for the fate of Kheterata is a certainty now and the Nirat faction believes its victory to be assured.\n\nDespite this imminent war for Kheterata's soul, other enemies also persist: the Sun Elves of §YElizna§! haunt the east, seeking to begin a second elven occupation and restore the tyranny of Jexis, while the gnollish invaders of §YViakkoc§! and §YGnollakaz§! despoil the west and south. Even should Nirat reign victorious over Kheterat, yet more war will be required before peace can truly return to Kheterata."
 string_start_title_viakkoc:0 "Viakkoc, the Scourge of All Seas"
 string_start_viakkoc:0 "§OPrimer§!\nThe §YSeascourge Gnolls§! are a relatively new people, born from the remnants of the §YMost High Kingdom of Viakkoc§! that survived it’s disastrous war with Gnollakaz over who got to invade Kheterata. Despite their newness, they’ve rapidly distinguished themselves from other gnolls by fully adopting the corsair lifestyle, with Cannor facing raids and piracy on a level unseen since the Era of Black Ice.\n\nUnder the dominance of the Seascourge gnolls, the Khasa people who once dominated what is now Viakkoc still survive in pockets, and it is known that a Prince of Khasa fled east and now seeks to save his people - though whether he means the Khasani specifically, or all of Akan, is hotly debated.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nWith their loss in the War for the Sorrow, the Viakkoca gnolls fled northwards into Akan and established their current Grand Corsair Kingdom, destroying the §YKingdom of Khasa§! while establishing the Republic of Ekha as a tributary. The §YKingdom of Deshak§! has survived by declaring fealty to the King of §YEborthil§!, establishing itself as Viakkoc’s foremost rival, while also hosting the final surviving member of the Khasani royal family.\n\nBeyond its rivalry with the Kingdoms of Eborthil and Deshak, the Grand Corsair Kingdom has also sets its sights northwards; rather than launching another futile war against §YGnollakaz§!, Viakkoc X declared his ambition to conquer the West Diven and Dameshead as the ‘Scourge of All Seas’. His son, Viakkoc XI, would adopt this as a new dynastic name and continue this ambition."
 
 string_start_religion_khetism:0 "[Root.start_religion_intro]\n\n§YKhetism§! is the religion of Kheterata and its closest vassal states, and is a major religion in Sarhal. It is a monotheistic and strictly organized faith, with the §YHigh Priest of Elikhet§! in Kheterat speaking with authority that could only be countermanded by the Khetarch or §YElikhet Himself§!. Elikhet is worshiped as the eternal Lord of Kheterata, and though the existence of other deities is not explicitly denied they are universally considered less worthy of veneration than Elikhet - their worship is tolerated to various extents, but plays no role in orthodox Khetist doctrine or rituals.\n\nBelief in Elikhet and the Khet is considered obvious fact, rather than a matter of faith. Instead, focus is on proper behavior and emulation of Elikhet - correct conduct, rather than faith, is emphasized in Khetism and as such rituals and taboos are the faith's primary impact on its followers. A good Khetist must not consort with the foul djinn, must not betray the recognized King, must not place a foreign deity above the Lord of Kheterata, and many other such taboos, the majority of them decreed by Elikhet himself."
