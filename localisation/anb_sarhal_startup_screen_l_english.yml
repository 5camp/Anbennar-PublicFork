 string_start_kheterata:0 "§OPrimer§!\n§YKheterata§! holds itself as the eldest civilization in all of the world, save perhaps a few dwarven remnants sulking in their caves, with a legacy tracing back to the time when even §YCastanor§! had yet to be born. It is a land dominated by the legacy of its divine founder and his children, Elikhet and the Khet, yet ruled by mere mortals - even Elikhet, for all his might and glory, often placed human friends on the throne of Kheterata rather than always sit upon it himself.\n\nThe blessing of the Sorrow, the magical river created by Elikhet at the height of his power and invested with much of his divine might, is the center of Kheteratan civilization - creating a bountiful, fertile heartland for the Kheteratans protected from all foes by miles upon miles of desert to the east and west. Though eventually this protection would fail in the face of gnollish and later Damerian conquests, these were always overthrown eventually and Kheterata returned to its state of splendid isolation, even if - as in the case of the Damerians - Elikhet himself had to rise from the dead to see it done.\n\nKheterata is dominated by the metropolitan §YKheteratan§! culture; born from the intermarriage of Elikhet's Bulwari followers and the native §YShasoura§! nomads of the Salahad who still dominate the east. Kheteratan culture is influenced by the historical subject peoples of Kheterata, portions of each having been relocated to the Sorrow as slaves and bondsmen; the §YDesha§! and §YKhasani§! of §YAkan§!, the §YBusinori§! of what is now §YBusilar§! and §YEborthil§!, the §YTijarikheti§! of the southern mountains, and the §YBrasanni§! of the Bulwari coast.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nRule over §YKheterata§! would eventually be granted to the Crodamos dynasty of Akan, who would maintain it even after losing Akan itself. This would change when the Sun Elf Jaher arrived in Kheterata following his conquest of Bulwar, as he would so charm the Khetarch Baqtkhet I that he mandated that Kheterata would enter an alliance with Jaher's empire and promised to crown him as King of Kheterata on the death of the human King at the time.\n\nThen the unexpected happened; the King of Kheterata outlived Jaher. This left Kheterata in a state of chaos; the Crodamos dynasty no longer held the support of the Khet, the Khetarch abandoned any semblance of leadership in favor of open hedonism, and Jaher's heir, Jexis, began a conquest of Kheterata with the permission of the apathetic Khetarch.\n\nThe Sun Elf occupation ended with the death of Baqtkhet I in 1160 and of Jexis in 1162. A new alliance was established between Khetarch Baqtkhet II and the Crodamos dynasty, while the gnolls of the south began a period of expansion that reached its climax in 1442 with the conquest of the south Sorrow by Grizaka Emperor-of-Gnollkind. Interpreted as a sign of royal weakness by many, a priestly rebellion in Nirat and the renewed Sun Elf expansionism of Elizna now threaten Crodamic rule."

 string_start_nirat:0 "§OPrimer§!\n§YNirat§!, the Temple of the Resurrection, is the center of a rebellion of the faithful against the Crodamic rulers of §YKheterata§!. Two figures lead the rebellion; §YHigh Priest Nahab the Defiant§! and §YCommander Aahmes the Dashing§!. Though they remain firm allies until the Crodamos have been toppled, already division shows its face between the ultratraditionalist priests of Nahab and the messianic soldiers of Aahmes.\n\nThe ultratraditionalist supporters of Nahab the Defiant believe that Kheterata has fallen into sin due to a failure to strictly abide by the taboos of Elikhet; only be crushing the decadent nobility and restoring power to the Khetarch, as was clearly intended, can this spiritual sickness be excised from Kheterata. However, concerned as they are with higher matters, it falls to Nahab - the greatest servant of the Khetarchy - to act in their place.\n\nBy contrast, the messianic supporters of Aahmes identify a different source of Kheterata's weakness:  the influence of foreigners, foremost among them the Damerian dogs of the House of Crodamos. Only by the full assimilation of such elements, and a return to pure §YKheteratan§! culture, can the Kingdom regain the strength that once saw it rule the entire western Salahad - and it falls to Aahmes, once a bandit before he foresaw his glorious destiny, to lead this purification.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nBorn out of frustration towards Crodamic weakness, as well as the open corruption of much of the Kheteratan upper class, the rebellion has seized much of the northern Sorrow and successfully cut Kheterat off from the coast of the Divenhal. With such a bold move crippling the already-weak Kings of the House of Crodamos, a final war for the fate of Kheterata is a certainty now and the Nirat faction believes its victory to be assured.\n\nDespite this imminent war for Kheterata's soul, other enemies also persist: the Sun Elves of §YElizna§! haunt the east, seeking to begin a second elven occupation and restore the tyranny of Jexis, while the gnollish invaders of §YViakkoc§! and §YGnollakaz§! despoil the west and south. Even should Nirat reign victorious over Kheterat, yet more war will be required before peace can truly return to Kheterata."
 
 string_start_religion_khetism:0 "[Root.start_religion_intro]\n\n§YKhetism§! is the religion of Kheterata and its closest vassal states, and is a major religion in Sarhal. It is a monotheistic and strictly organized faith, with the §YHigh Priest of Elikhet§! in Kheterat speaking with authority that could only be countermanded by the Khetarch or §YElikhet Himself§!. Elikhet is worshiped as the eternal lord of Kheterata, and though the existence of other deities is not explicitly denied they are universally considered less worthy of veneration than Elikhet - their worship is tolerated to various extents, but plays no role in orthodox Khetist doctrine or rituals.\n\nBelief in Elikhet and the Khet is considered obvious fact, rather than a matter of faith. Instead, focus is on proper behavior and emulation of Elikhet - correct conduct, rather than faith, is emphasized in Khetism and as such rituals and taboos are the faith's primary impact on its followers - a good Khetist must not consort with the foul djinn, must not betray the recognized King, must not adopt the worship of a foreign deity, and many other such taboos, the majority of them prohibited by Elikhet himself.\n\nKhetism is organized in the same manner Elikhet's own court was; the Khetarch, standing in for Elikhet himself, is the foremost authority but one too concerned with greater matters to truly rule the faithful. Instead, the King of Kheterata protects the holy land while the High Priest guides the faithful, a division of duties tracing back to the very founding of Kheterata. Outside Kheterata itself, recognized proxies perform the same duties regionally, but remain subordinate to the King and High Priest."
