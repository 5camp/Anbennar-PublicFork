    effelai_worship.2.d:0 "Her song, a constant reminder of our oath to her. To protect from external threats, and to keep these vast jungles cleansed of those that would seek to corrupt her. But there's more to her beauty than just this swamp of horrors. Vast regions surround us, each a unique part of her being, and each equally important to the survival of the others. We must go forth and visit each region, collecting the various boons offered to us along our journey, until finally we can settle down. With our goal completed, we can make the last region we visit our home. Only after the harsh trials we are about to face, will we have once again earned the right to be her protectors.\n\n\n\n§G"Each region contains a holy site we must visit. Picking an efficient path could be important, as we have no idea what dangers loom on the horizon."§!"
