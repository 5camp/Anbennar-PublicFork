  spiderwretch_teaching_our_ways_desc:0 "Expanding our workshop-embassies in Qirnualaroq and Jögghlumo has made them more open about their secrets. Our workers are not only just working, but also providing us with valuable information from the inside. To continue our show of goodwill, we shall indulge them with more goods and techniques of production."

  spiderwretch_valley_of_ogres_desc:0 "As our scouts previously reported, there are some ogrish, some kind of troll, nations close to our spiderdens-entrance. They seem dumb, but have valuble skills and power. Those could be useful to us."

  spiderwretch_large_man_power_desc:0 "With our ogrish companions now in our fold, we can start to discuss a common problem. The centaurs, the wild nomadic horse-man people of the lightlands. The ogres have been fighting them for longer than us. With our armies properly established, we can learn some things from them. In return we can teach them some strategies of our own."

  spiderwretch_smalls_among_bigs_desc:0 "Our cooperation in war and production has been a delight to us all, mostly us, but they do not know that. They are not very good at keeping secrets it seems, but we are generous, we will expand our production cooperation."

  spiderwretch_geniuses_in_brutality_desc:0 "The ogre valley used to be splintered. Internal conflicts clogging their unity. Now that is no longer the case. In their unision, and in our technological advances, we have found a new type of warfare. The bigger the cannon the bigger the boom, yes, but if the big cannon is caught we lose the boom. Ogres have massive mammoths and can even carry cannons of their own. Why can we not?"

  spiderwretch_silken_cities_title:0 "Silken Cities"
  spiderwretch_silken_cities_desc:0 "With our alchemists' success in making hardened silk, we can now pursue an old dream of ours. Cities, hanging from the ceiling, made from silk and no longer on the hard rock of the floor. Our people can now live in more comfort and more productivity as well."

  #Center column
  spiderwretch_the_lands_of_light_title:0 "The Land of Light"
  spiderwretch_the_lands_of_light_desc:0 "As we migrated to the cave-delta of the eastern reach, we discovered the outside. A large flat landscape with blinding light coming from a blue roof. Our tribal leaders seemed keen to stay in that cave-delta, as it was ripe with small caves and crevices to live and farm in. While we settle, we must explore the potential of the lightlands. Send out 3 groups of spiderscouts, one in each direction."

  spiderwretch_a_taste_for_blood_desc:0 "Through luck, but mostly the hard skill of our spiderriders, we have bested the four-legged enemy multiple times.

  spiderwretch_blood_revealed_opportunity_title:0 "Blood-revealed Opportunity"
  spiderwretch_blood_revealed_opportunity_desc:0 "With our initial goals under our control, we realize that we can do much more.

  spiderwretch_unhindered_growth_title:0 "Unhindered Growth"
  spiderwretch_unhindered_growth_desc:0 "With our market and our ambitions growing larger, the facility of Weballey is no longer large enough. Since we now control the open vast lightlands, we should exploit that advantage. Moving our facility to a new and larger location will un-cap our ambitions. Better, larger and faster spiders will be bred forth and tamed for pets, mounts and silk."

  spiderwretch_a_life_in_suspension_title:0 "A Life in Suspension"
  spiderwretch_a_life_in_suspension_desc:0 "New spiders out of the facility have brought forth new ideas and needs. Their silk seemingly harder than other silk. This sparks an idea. Silk that is usable in armor, housing and much more. The more powerful goblins of Pauzhrad demand higher living standards aswell. Proceed with experimenting."

  spiderwretch_silken_infrastructure_title:0 "Silken Infrastructure"
  spiderwretch_silken_infrastructure_desc:0 "With our new hardened silk used widely, we have realized the potential of this research. While we may control the lightlands, and our spiders themselves having no problem traversing them, wagons and goblins on foot struggle. The ground is dusty, dry and its hard to navigate.

  spiderwretch_unsightly_facility_desc:0 "With trade and wealth flowing in and out of our Pauzhrad and the growing city just outside it, the massive breeding facility has become a sore sight. Some foreign traders do not appreciate the to-them-scary variations of spiders in there. Trading is one of our primary economic goals, so lets oblige them, it needed to be renewed anyway. Let us build one just outside the flows of traders, but not too far away for our government to supervise."

  #Centerright column

  spiderwretch_the_silk_hold_title:0 "The Silk Hold"
  spiderwretch_the_silk_hold_desc:0 "The crawlers are finally united under one banner. Our capital is rapidly developing, yet its name is lacking.

  spiderwretch_centralized_breeding_title:0 "Centralized Breeding"
  spiderwretch_centralized_breeding_desc:0 "With a central government controlling the matters of the spiderdens, we now have clear overview. Till now, all of our spiders have been tamed and partially bred differently per group of crawlers.

Establish a facility near our capital, there we shall create the future."

  spiderwretch_caravan_spiders_title:0 "Caravan Spiders"
  spiderwretch_caravan_spiders_desc:0 "The increased size of our facility paid off. Breeding spiders are a fast process, as their lifecycles are very short. This allowed our breeders to bring forth an ungodly large spider. Some chemicals might have been added too. A spider so large, a small town could live on its back. It is quite slow unfortunately, so our generals were left dissappointed. Our kartel leaders and shamans looked at it with power in their eyes. They saw the potential. This could usher in a new era of trade."

  spiderwretch_cross_roads_title:0 "Cross Roads"
  spiderwretch_cross_roads_desc:0 "The trade flows across the large plains effortlessly. With our caravans going out, new trading hubs have emerged, especially at the meeting point between the bulwari road and the lake-fed roads. Furthermore the bulwari trademarket has even larger potential than the lakes. This could easily be accomodated with some further investements."

  spiderwretch_securing_the_lighthlands_title:0 "Securing the Lightlands"
  spiderwretch_securing_the_lighthlands_desc:0 "We did it. We cast the large lands of light under our banner. Noone on this side of the mountains can compare. We did what the centaurs failed to do, despite their clear advantage in knowlegde of the plains. Ofcourse we will utilize that knowlegde ruthlessly to our own advantage. We might have won, but not learning from our friends and especially foes is fatal to any future."

  spiderwretch_brewing_venom_title:0 "Brewing Venom"
  spiderwretch_brewing_venom_desc:0 "They say venombrew is the strongest drink in all the lands. Till now it was mostly produced in few amounts. We can now establish a proper brewery and distribute venombrew, mostly to our shamans ofcourse. Average goblins would not know what to do with the expanded conscience."

  spiderwretch_expanding_our_religion_title:0 "Expanding our Religion"
  spiderwretch_expanding_our_religion_desc:0 "With the belief in Muta Kroozpauz spreading across the lightlands, our desire to adapt to the world increases. Large distances can cause differens and rifts over time. To combat this lets expand our religious system, and even include the natives' gods. Ofcourse they are lesser versions and not worth worshipping. This will empower the status of our Muta Kroozpauz."

  spiderwretch_order_of_the_spider_title:0 "Order of the Spider"
  spiderwretch_order_of_the_spider_desc:0 "Massive spiders, wealth flowing and the dominant nation on the continent, this can only mean one thing. We are the chosen of Muta Kroozpauz. We are her will on Halann and as such we dedicate ourselves to it. The Caravan spider shall be her representative in our trading order."

  spiderwretch_kroozpauz_realm_title:0 "Kroozpauz' Realm"
  spiderwretch_kroozpauz_realm_desc:0 "We have spread the realm of Muta Kroozpauz across the world. Silk, venombrew and much else is being praised and valued everywhere. We have truly succeeded. We must never forget our roots, the small insignificant clan in the caves of the back-then dark spiderdens, because that will keep us smart."
