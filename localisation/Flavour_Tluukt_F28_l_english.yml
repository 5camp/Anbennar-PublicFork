###EVENTS###

 flavour_tluukt.1.title:0 "Patronizing the First Temple"
 flavour_tluukt.1.desc:0 "The priests of Eduz-Vacyn shuffle nervously, awaiting impatiently their uncertain fate in the wake of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s announced visit to the temple. When conquering Zokka visited the temple, he came to pillage and ruin. When conquering Jaher visited, he came to pray. [Root.Monarch.GetName] does neither - [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] merely observes the fading murals and the cracked edifices in scornful silence. Soon, under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] direction, the face of the temple changes - the damages caused by Zokka are repaired and the ancient edifices are restored to their past glory... but the people change too. The elven high-priests, many presiding since the days of Jaher, pass away one by one - illness and weakness, supposedly. They are replaced not by elves, but by men of no distinguished education and of dubious backgrounds. These men begin to rally against the elves, against Jaher, against the very foundation of the new teachings. They clamor for a return to the old ways, a return to a cult that glorifies Surakel and not mortal elves.\n\nThe rest of Bulwar has unsurprisingly condemned Eduz-Vacyn, seeing the taint of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s influence for what it is and censoring the teachings of the temple. But, in private, many Bulwari must wonder... how can the words of the First Temple, the place where the light of Surael first truly descended, be ignored so easily? No one speaks these thoughts aloud, but the tension of their presence can be felt all the same."
 flavour_tluukt.1.a:0 "Divided, they shall soon crumble."

 flavour_tluukt.2.title:0 "Censuring the First Temple"
 flavour_tluukt.2.desc:0 "The priests of Eduz-Vacyn have long been oppressed by gnolls - first by Zokka and now by [From.Monarch.GetName]. We have always directed our prayers toward their salvation, even as we burned with the shame that prayers were all we could offer. Yet, it seems our prayers have been rewarded only with more calamitous news. The priesthood of that ancient temple, far from resisting the temptation of their Gnollish tormentors, have fallen in league with them and begun to proclaim foul heresy! [F31.Monarch.GetTitle] [F31.Monarch.GetName] [F31.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has issued a tract decrying the 'deleterious influence of Jaher's successors on righteous worship'. Naturally, this publication and countless others have been banned throughout our realm, along with any pilgrimage to this heretic temple, but we are still left to wonder how the birthplace of Surael's light could be so corrupted..."
 flavour_tluukt.2.a:0 "Our subjects will surely understand the necessity of this censorship."

 flavour_tluukt.3.title:0 "Human Conscripts Revolt"
 flavour_tluukt.3.desc:0 "Though elves hold all the highest positions of government and command in [tluukt_conscript_revolter.GetName], it falls upon poor Bulwari peasants to fill out the conscription. Simple men - craftsmen, bakers, farmers, pottery makers, each with families and aspirations. These peasants fight zealously in the name of Surael... usually. In our war with [tluukt_conscript_revolter.GetName], however, their faith is tested in each battle again and again as wave after wave of gnoll hits hard and hits fast. The elven commanders retreat from these losing battles, and we let them run. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has commanded [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] pack to focus their bloodlust solely on the human conscripts - but no slaves are to be taken. Instead, countless fathers are turned into corpses, cannibalized in front their comrade's very eyes. Their sons are left behind to rage, to fear, and to wonder... to wonder why only elves return from the battles where so many of their friends and family perished."
 flavour_tluukt.3.a:0 "Terror can be as effective a tool as a burning knife in cutting the hearts of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s foes."

 flavour_tluukt.4.title:0 "Human Conscripts Revolt"
 flavour_tluukt.4.desc:0 "Our battle with [From.GetName] has been especially fierce, and though our commanders rode forth from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] with pride and valor at the head of a glorious army, as of late they have been returning with their heads hung in shame - when they return at all. The survivors of these battles paint a horrific story of demonic gnolls cresting the hills, yipping in fiendish laughter as they cut down man after man, heedless of their own wounds. Whether these stories are true or not, the devastating losses have prompted us to issue another conscription to the various settlements of the realm. The response, however, has been less than enthusiastic - though our subjects should be proud to defend the light of Surael, some of our provinces have risen up in revolt! They cry out, 'No longer shall we send our sons to fight and die while elves remain secure in their walled gardens!' even as they muster themselves to fight our own legions."
 flavour_tluukt.4.a:0 "We shall see about that!"

 flavour_tluukt.6.title:0 "A Promise of Partition"
 flavour_tluukt.6.desc:0 "In the days of old, conflict between harpy and gnoll often proved inevitable as both factions struggled to secure their rightful dominance over Bulwar. With the arrival of elfkind and the subsequent conquests of their Phoenix Empire, however, such petty rivalries have become increasingly pointless as our survival increasingly hinged on co-operation whenever feasible. The formal alliance between our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] proved instrumental in allowing them to cleave their way through the elfrealms of Bulwar while we focused on our own conquests. Yet, as our borders draw closer and the prospect of a monstrous hegemony over Bulwar becomes more tangible, it is clear that a line in the sand must be drawn somewhere, else our alliance be broken on the eve of greatness to petulant in-fighting.  Once the influence of the elves has been shattered, however, only time will tell whether our alliance shall hold in the face of our ambitions."
 flavour_tluukt.6.a:0 "We will abide by this partition... for now."

 flavour_tluukt.7.title:0 "The Order Ransacked"
 flavour_tluukt.7.desc:0 "The practice of elf worship finds its roots within the words and deeds of the elf Taelarios, who bound together the crumbling realms of Bulwar with the insidious glue of the New Sun Cult. Yet, though diplomacy was said to be his finest virtue, no land as contentious as Bulwar could be united without any degree of ruthlessness. In the city of Medurubar stands the headquarters of the Order of the Zenith, the dark left hand of Taelarios, a hand that champions the cause of the New Sun Cult through the virtues of the rack and the pyre. Countless heretics have been burned in these city streets, and the Order of the Zenith presided over it all, ruling with fear where fealty failed and ensuring the New Sun Cult remained dominant. In this regard, gnolls can stand to learn a little from old Taelarios - Bulwar is best ruled by fear, and to show what we have learned we shall raze Medurubar to the ground. The Zenith's Purge of Medurubar in 1220 shall pale in comparison to the cruel ingenuity of gnolls!"
 flavour_tluukt.7.a:0 "Let green flame burn it all down... starting with the Zenith's headquarters itself!"

 flavour_tluukt.8.title:0 "Elfking Slain"
 flavour_tluukt.8.desc:0 "As the siege of [F37.Capital.GetCapitalName] draws to its violent conclusion, the rule of the venerable [F37.Monarch.GetTitle] [F37.Monarch.GetName] [F37.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is cut to a grisly end. The once dignified elf is pulled from [F37.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace to the streets, and as the city burns around [F37.Monarch.GetHerHim] [F37.Monarch.GetHerHis] gnoll captors toss a sword haphazardly to [F37.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet.\n\nThe whooping laughter of countless gnoll warriors echoes through [F37.Monarch.GetHerHis] ears as [F37.Monarch.GetSheHe] lifts with shaking hands the sword and points it towards [F37.Monarch.GetHerHis] foe - [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], who stands opposite [F37.Monarch.GetName] in the impromptu arena formed by a circle of spectating gnolls. The two eye each other tensely - though [F37.Monarch.GetHerHis] back is bowed with the burdens of age, a keen cunning still burns in the eyes of [F37.Monarch.GetName], and [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes careful note of it. Even as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] pack grows reckless in their mocking laughter, [Root.Monarch.GetName] regards [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] foe with the wariness of an experienced warrior, pacing cautiously towards [F37.Monarch.GetHerHim] with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own weapon at the ready. In a flash, the combat commences - yet in the same moment it is ended, as the life and intelligence fades from [F37.Monarch.GetName]'s eyes, [F37.Monarch.GetHerHis] age rendering [F37.Monarch.GetHerHim] no match for [F37.Monarch.GetHerHis] opponent. [Root.Monarch.GetName] merely shrugs as the body slumps to the ground and the yipping of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] warpack's laughter reaches its noisy crescendo.\n\nThe news of [F37.Capital.GetCapitalName]'s fall spreads quickly across Bulwar, and many fear the worst - that [F37.Monarch.GetName], the guiding beacon of the New Sun Cult, would be sacrificed to the dark masters of the demonspawn on a burning pyre, as countless other elves have been. Few would be consoled to learn of [F37.Monarch.GetHerHis] actual fate - cannibalized by [Root.Monarch.GetName] immediately after their duel, so that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] might inherit the foresight and stability of [F37.Monarch.GetHerHis] long rule."
 flavour_tluukt.8.a:0 "Such is the fate of all who oppose the glory of our pack!"

 flavour_tluukt.9.title:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Slain"
 flavour_tluukt.9.desc:0 "As the siege of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] draws to its violent conclusion, the rule of the venerable [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is cut to a grisly end. Our dignified [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is pulled from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace to the streets, and as the city burns around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gnoll captors toss a sword haphazardly to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet.\n\nThe whooping laughter of demonic gnoll warriors echoes cruelly through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ears as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] lifts with noble hands the sword and points it towards [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hated foe - [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], who stands opposite [Root.Monarch.GetName] in the impromptu arena, flanked by a circle of cowardly gnolls. The two eye each other tensely - though [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is battered with the wounds inflicted by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] captors, [Root.Monarch.GetName] regards with a keen cunning all the myriad weaknesses of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] opponent. Even as [From.Monarch.GetName]'s bodyguards grows reckless in their mocking laughter, [From.Monarch.GetName] regards [From.Monarch.GetHerHim] foe with the wariness of an experienced warrior. Clearly intimidated, [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] paces hesitantly towards [Root.Monarch.GetName] with [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] own weapon at the ready. In a flash, the combat commences - yet in the same moment it is ended, as the life and intelligence fades from [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s eyes, cut low by some demonic treachery on [From.Monarch.GetName]'s part.\n\nThe news of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]'s fall spreads quickly across Bulwar, and many fear the worst - that [Root.Monarch.GetName], the guiding beacon of the New Sun Cult, would be sacrificed to the dark masters of the demonspawn on a burning pyre, as countless other elves have been. Their imaginations fail to conceive [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s actual ignominous fate - cannibalized by [From.Monarch.GetName] immediately after their duel, so that [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] might sate [From.Monarch.GetHerHim] demonic gluttony."
 flavour_tluukt.9.a:0 "We shall avenge [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]! The death of a thousand gnolls is not enough!"

 flavour_tluukt.10.title:0 "The Royal Artillery"
 flavour_tluukt.10.desc:0 "The city of Birsartansbar burns without beauty. The once ostentatious manors that hosted countless masquerade balls wither into blackened ashen husks. The noble palace that watched over the city is reduced to a blind heap of rubble. The mournful wailing of the city's former residents echoes over it all as they are clapped into irons and dragged into cages. The destruction is without meaning - senseless devastation inflicted upon a formerly opulent city. As it unfolds, and the city's burning carcass blossoms open like a red, burning flower, the true treasure of Birsartansbar avails itself to its gnollish conquerors. In the heart of the citadel, the royal artillery stands amidst ashes, its cannons untouched by flame. Though originally of dwarf make, elven ingenuity has refined these guns over the years into precise implements of warfare. Gnollish malice shall now turn these delicate tools into explosive bludgeons, so that the sack of Birsartansbar might be repeated again and again until there is nothing left to oppose us."
 flavour_tluukt.10.a:0 "Cannonfire heralds the ascension of our pack!"

 flavour_tluukt.11.title:0 "The Sack of Birsartansbar"
 flavour_tluukt.11.desc:0 "Waves of refugees herald grim tidings. The city of Birsartansbar, capital of Birzartanšes, has fallen to gnollish conquest, cementing the gnollish grip over Bulwar Proper and ushering us true believers of Surael into an age of darkness unwitnessed. Our faith is challenged on every front as the legacy of Jaher is defiled and the legitimacy of the Sun Elves begins to crack. More pressing, however, is the threat of further gnollish conquests leveraged by the numerous Birzartanesi artillery pieces that were surely captured during the city siege. Strong walls have always been the surest defense against gnolls, but that can no longer the case when those walls will soon be challenged by cannons of Birzartanesi make. Emergency measures must be taken, and a proper army mustered. It is obvious, however, that no subject of ours is keen to face these gnolls in battle, so it is crucial that we carefully determine who receives the brunt of this muster."

 flavour_tluukt.11.a:0 "Only a mass conscription of our human subjects can stave off these gnollish hordes."
 flavour_tluukt.11.b:0 "A draft of elven elites not seen since the days of Jaher shall be our salvation."

 flavour_tluukt.12.title:0 "The Fall of Azka-Evran"
 flavour_tluukt.12.desc:0 "Built into the foothills of the Serpentreach, encircled by thick curtain walls, and garrisoned with elite sharpshooters, the citadel of Azka-Evran has withstood all the turmoils of time and war. Its endurance has turned it into an icon of elven resilience, a symbol of hope for all elf-worshippers hoping to likewise endure the storm of our conquest. As the citadel burns to ashes around us, we are reminded of the lessons our conquest has taught us - that symbols are weapons, tools to be perverted and turned against their makers. With the collapse of this last bastion of elfkind, any who have dared to continue resisting us will be forced to come to terms with the futility of their struggles.\n\nThe value of Azka-Evran does not lay solely in its symbolism, of course. The prodigious gold mine at the fortress roots puts to shame all the other mines of Bulwar, not merely for its abundance but because of the careful administrations of its overseers, the szel-Beliqturaš family. Even as we decimate the rest of the citadel's garrison, it would be foolish of us to not ensure their continued administration of the mines - whether they will it or not."
 flavour_tluukt.12.a:0 "From the ashes of Azka-Evran, a fortress of gold shall be born."

 flavour_tluukt.13.title:0 "Resistance is Futile"
 flavour_tluukt.13.desc:0 "The citadel of Azka-Evran had long withstood the test of time as a bulwark of Surael's light in the darkest hours of our history. Even as the rest of Bulwar crumbled to monstrous invasion, worshippers looked to Azka-Evran as a symbol to quiet endurance. No longer - it has fallen to gnollish hands and the garrison has been slaughtered to a man. The walls, painted with gore, are now dedicated to the dark masters of the gnolls. The gold mines churn out bullion to feed the insatiable appetite of gnollish conquest, and the light has been thoroughly snuffed from the outlying provinces.\n\nThe utter defeat of Surael's Chosen in this matter has prompted no small amount of fear and doubt amongst the human worshippers in our land. Key among their doubts is the growing belief that reserving administrative matters to elves alone has been the primary cause for the failure to contain the gnollish threat, and there is now a growing demand for humans to become more involved in governance and planning of counter-offensives. Naturally, accepting this demand also means acknowledging othe belief that failing to stop the gnolls lies squarely on elven shoulders."
 flavour_tluukt.13.a:0 "This is Bulwar's darkest hour. We must be willing to accept change."
 flavour_tluukt.13.b:0 "Nonsense. We are Chosen to rule, not they!"

 flavour_tluukt.15.title:0 "Surael's Chosen Irrelevant"
 flavour_tluukt.15.desc:0 "The light is lost, it has fallen to Malevolent Dark. The hope sparked by Jaher, spread by his legions, reinforced by Taelarios, maintained by generations of elven rule - that hope is no more.

But we remain. We have always remained - before Taelarios, before the Phoenix Legions, before Jaher, there was still such a thing as hope. It was a slim prayer, a feeble light beset by rough winds at all times, but it was never truly extinguished.

Spectators hailing from across all of [Root.GetName] and her loyal subjects have gathered to witness the first of what would soon become a regular tradition - the legendary Krahsport. In gnollish society the pastime of violent, full-contact sport is regarded as the height of physical recreation, allowing one to train both their mind and body while deepening relations among the pack with the adrenaline-filled highs and lows of victory and defeat. Bulwari natives, on the other hand, have critiqued gnoll sport as being savage, unrefined, and physically extremely dangerous. Few would imagine that, after centuries of refinement, the same sport that once divided gnoll and man would be seen as a symbol of unity between [Root.GetName] and her subjects.\n\nIn the Krahsport, human and gnoll athletes compete on an equal footing, with no handicap or bias, whether it be individually or in teams as the specific contest requires. The games are divided equally between high-contact, physically demanding gnoll sports and more refined, skill-intensive Bulwari athletic traditions. Wrestling, archery, horseback riding, swordfighting, water polo, handball, marathons, and falconry number among some of the original Krahsport contests, with many more featuring in the Krahsports of later years. The merging of gnoll and Bulwari sport, at first done for purely recreational reasons, would ultimately contribute to a strong and truly [Root.GetAdjective] national identity.\n\nThe comradery of the Krahsport would go beyond the sands of the arena, however, for the real cutthroat competitions were to be held amidst the offices and magistrates of the bureaucracy of [Root.GetName] and her subjects, all fighting for the honor of hosting the Krahsport in their capitals in the regular intervals that it is not hosted in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] itself. To host the Krahsport would bring fame and prestige to one's dominion, along with no small amount of wealth from the increased economic activity and [Root.GetAdjective] stipends. This tradition of a moving Krahsport would further intertwine the various dominions of [Root.GetName] but would also result in the Krahsport eventually being seen as a pan-Bulwar tradition, such that even after the fall of [Root.GetName] it would continue to be hosted among the cities of Bulwar and beyond."

Without a word, both packleaders recognize this immutable fact and withdraw from the field. This dispute now can only be solved with the clash of our armies, and the supremacy of our pack in Bulwar can now only be won with the total destruction of Zokka's pack and their will to fight."
 flavour_tluukt.55.descC:0 "It is inconceivable. How can this be? Such are the thoughts of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] just barely manages to dodge a magical barrage from [F29.Monarch.GetName]. It is worse than being on the backfoot - [Root.Monarch.GetName] is losing, and badly. A second blast strikes [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in the side, sending [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] tumbling to the dirt. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] struggles to muster the strength to stand, [F29.Monarch.GetName] approaches, licking their lips as they prepare for the final blow. Before it can be delivered, however, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Contingency activates, spiriting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] away from the battlefield, no doubt leaving [F29.Monarch.GetName] blinking in surprise.\n\nThis was never going to be a fair fight, yet even though [Root.Monarch.GetName] has survived it, [F29.Monarch.GetName] will no doubt quickly capitalize on our retreat. Even now, many of our pack are no doubt questioning their loyalty to one who runs from the field...

Our troops were forced to follow the flight of Karodir back to our heartlands, leaving Bulwar free for Tluukt's taking. Unfortunately, it seems that Tluukt's ravenous advance did not end with the razing of Bulwar, and now at last her hellish curtain closes around [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. The nobility, looking out in fear as gnolls fill the streets, beg for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to sally forth and put them all to the earth with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] magical prowess! But Tluukt herself is no doubt among her troops, and the scars of our last duel with her still burn..."

Before [F42.Monarch.GetSheHe] can do any further harm to our pack's warriors, Tluukt quickly moves in to intercept the bolt, absorbing its impact with her arcane wards. This is not the first time Tluukt has grappled with an elven mage in magical combat - our pack's subjugation of Bulwar in 1439 AA was won only after our crushing victory over Karodir I Varamzuir, the suzerain of those lands at the time.

###GOV REFORMS###
#################

 tluukt_tluuktraak_reform:0 "The All-Cleaving Kingdom of Tluukt"
 tluukt_tluuktraak_reform_desc:0 "In the ancient days of Bulwar's bygone Age of Monsters, gnoll matriarchs ruled over the lesser gnoll packs and the native Bulwari in elaborate and sometimes even equitable hierarchies. The rise of the Great Xhaz, however, spelled the end of these arrangements, and though in the centuries since Bulwar has seen its fair share of kingdoms ruled by gnollkind, none come close to the glorious states concieved by those gnolls of antiquity - or so it was until Tluukt 'Cleaver-of-Realms' cleaved anew her own realm and codified the laws and hierarchies still in use today by the Tluuktraak."

 tluukt_litter_reform:0 "Restricted Litter Cannibalism"
 tluukt_litter_reform_desc:0 "The Litter Reforms put a controversial end to the various practices of litter cannibalism amongst gnoll packs by restricting intra-litter competition to only the cubs born from the matriarch of our pack herself. Any other gnoll cub whose mother is unable or unwilling to equitibly provide for them is seized as a ward of the pack. These reforms serve a number of purposes - reducing cub mortality increases the number of gnolls available to be used by the pack, and cubs directly raised by the pack are invariably the most loyal. Most importantly, by restricting litter cannibalism to the highest echelon of our society, we ensure that our rulers are only those weaned by the survival of the fittest, and that those they rule are born weaker as a result of their soft upbringings."
  
 tluukt_xalgekyr_reform:0 "Formalized Xalgekyr"
 tluukt_xalgekyr_reform_desc:0 "The practice of slavery is an ancient and time-honored tradtion, and can by no means ever be abolished. Yet, while our attitude towards slavery is what distinguishes gnollish society above all others, the practice of industrious free-enterprise slavers seizing at their discretion whatever krah strikes their fancy is an antiquated and self-destructive system. By directly administrating the enslavement of krah as a matter of state and imposing a xalgekyr - a blood tax to be levied against all krah in accordance to their hierarchy - not only will we impose order upon a chaotic occupation, we will actually increase the number and quality of slaves available to our purposes as a result of stricter and more even-spread acquisition. The blood-tax need not be paid in blood alone, of course - the wealthy and influential are free to buy from our pack their weight in gold."
  
 tluukt_littlepack_reform:0 "The Little Pack"
 tluukt_littlepack_reform_desc:0 "The loyalties of our Bulwari subjects have often at times been challenged by their own self-interests. Gnoll hegemons of the past have sought to curb these self-interests with the penalties of pain and suffering, but we have grown wiser to the needs of our subjects. By relaxing the rigid hierarchies established by Tluukt and allowing for some social mobility among our krah subjects, we can engender a greater fealty than the threat of a whip ever could. The trick lay in the price of this mobility - much like true gnolls, those Bulwari who seek to elevate themselves must do so at the expense of their fellows, such that only the most worthy may ascend. And, of course, this new 'Little Pack' will always be subservient to our greater pack."
