 ynn_barges.1.t:0 "The Final Journey"
 ynn_barges.1.d:0 "For years, $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has ruled our nation. For good or ill, they have led our people towards tomorrow. Today, however, their journey of leadership has ended, and their journey toward the afterlife, their journey along the sacred Ynn, begins. If this journey is to be successful, however, we must ensure proper transportation, so as to keep our ruler untainted from any impure floating in the River."

 ynn_barges.2.d1:0 "The barge of the dead monarch of [From.GetName] has arrived at our Great Ynnic Dam of [Root.GetName]. If they are to continue their journey down the Ynn, is up to us to decide."
 ynn_barges.2.d2:0 "The barge of our dead monarch $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has arrived at our Great Ynnic Dam of [Root.GetName]. The inhabitants observe with the due reverence as the barge floats onward, nearing the dam's gates."

 ynn_barges.3.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Demands a Toll"
 ynn_barges.3.d:0 "The [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName], holder of the Great Ynnic Dam of [From.GetName], demands a toll from our nation if our monarch is to pass. Though many see this as little more than extortion, if we wish to properly deliver $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ to the Divine Waterfall, we may just have to pay up. However, the option always remains to sink the barge, and have our monarch pass through with the commoners, if need be."
 ynn_barges.3.c:0 "We'll just open up the dam ourselves"
 ynn_barges.3.a:0 "Very well"
 ynn_barges.3.b:0 "Sink the barge"
 
 ynn_barges.4.t:0 "Payment Arrives"
 ynn_barges.4.d:0 "Another barge originating from [From.GetName] has arrived, sailing low in the water, due to its cargo: a massive quantity of coinage. It seems our toll has been payed for."
 ynn_barges.4.a:0 "Let their dead monarch through"
 
 ynn_barges.5.t:0 "No Reply"
 ynn_barges.5.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have sunk their own barge, allowing their monarch to float with the rest of the dead through the Commoner's Gate."
 ynn_barges.5.a:0 "That settles that then"
 
 ynn_barges.6.t:0 "Our Barge Didn't Make It"
 ynn_barges.6.d:0 "With our barge stopped, we have been forced to a last resort: to let our monarch float along the River on their own. Though they run the risk of being tainted by the evil souls who may be floating in the River, at least this way they will make it to the afterlife, for better or worse."
 ynn_barges.6.a:0 "Hopefully they have better luck in the next world"
 
 ynn_barges.7.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Prevents Passage"
 ynn_barges.7.d:0 "It seems that the [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName] has stopped our barge from continuing its holy journey, leaving us with no choice but to sink the barge, and have our ruler run the risk of being tainted. There seems to be nothing we can do, and their ruler appears to have no intention of changing their mind."

 ynn_barges.8.b:0 "Prepare a small ritual"
 ynn_barges.8.c:0 "Hold a grand ceremony"
 
 ynn_barges.9.t:0 "Final Rest"
 ynn_barges.9.d:0 "The barge carrying our monarch has reached the end of the Ynn, and, at the Divine Waterfall, our monarch moves on to the next life, pure of any taint of this mortal realm. With their journey ended, a new journey, the journey of [Root.Monarch.GetName], can finally begin."
 ynn_barges.9.a:0 "From yesterday to tomorrow"
 
 ynn_barges.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Forces their Way Through"
 ynn_barges.10.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have used the ongoing conflict to send troops to seize our dam, and opened up its gate to their barge."
 ynn_barges.10.a:0 "They weren't supposed to do that!"
 
 ynn_barges.11.t:0 "Ynnic Barge Lands"
 ynn_barges.11.d1:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of an ancestor has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into the lake from the Great Waterfall above. The vessel, damaged after the drop, reached the shore, and inside it we found several valuables such as pots, gemstones and clothes, as well as the coffin itself, lined with precious metal."
 ynn_barges.11.d2:0 "A vessel has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above. The vessel, damaged after the drop, reached the shore, and inside it no occupant was found; rather, it contained several valuables such as pots, gemstones and clothes, as well as a coffin, lined with precious metal."
 ynn_barges.11.d3:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of a dead Ynnic monarch has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above. The vessel, damaged after the drop, reached the shore, and inside it there are several valuables such as pots, gemstones and clothes, as well as the coffin itself, lined with precious metal."
 ynn_barges.11.a:0 "A tribute from the heavens! Seize it and bury the body"
 ynn_barges.11.b:0 "Loot the contents of the vessel"
 ynn_barges.11.c:0 "Bury these valuables along with the coffin"
 
 ynn_events.0.t:0 "Reurbanization"
 ynn_events.0.d:0 "After centuries of decay, warfare, and abandonment in favour of the countryside, the peace brought about by our nation has allowed the hub cities along the Ynn River to know prosperity once again, reaching levels of urban sprawl unseen since the times of the Ynnic Empire.\n\nWhere once laid ruins and decayed buildings getting scavenged for materials, are now blooming metropolises whose streets draw all from Cannorian fighters to Raheni merchants, and all along the Ynn people are thanking our nation for that."
 ynn_events.0.a:0 "May this be an age of even greater prosperity"
 
 ynn_events.1.t:0 "Athonovie Yrisar"
 ynn_events.1.d:0 "Today, we witness a miracle. The Ynnic Empire, the greatest nation in the world, was brought down by the hubris of its emperors and the short-sightedness of its subjects, who pulled it apart until it was an empire no more. But today that damage is undone, for the Ynn is one, and an Empire again.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been bathed and crowned [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in a holy ceremony and, from the height of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] balcony at [Root.Capital.GetName] Castle, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has announced a month of festivity while cheered on by a huge crowd."
 ynn_events.1.a:0 "My beloved subjects… we have to make something special for you"
 
 ynn_events.2.t:0 "Yrisar Rnovo"
 ynn_events.2.d1:0 "Today, we reclaim our birtright. The Ynnic Empire, the greatest nation in the world, was brought down by the decadence of its Sarda emperors and the short-sightedness of its subjects, who forgot the virtues that made it worthy of existing in the first place. But today that damage is undone, for the Ynn is one, and an Empire again.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been crowned [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in a solemn ceremony, and invitations were sent out to all knights of the realm for the greatest tourney the Ynn has ever seen."
 ynn_events.2.d2:0 "Today an air of solemnity fills the streets of Malacnar, a somber one for this day spells the end of something, and the beginning of something new. Speaking in front of the largest gathering of warriors the city has ever seen, Battleking [Root.Monarch.GetName] has declared that the warriors of Malacnar will no longer fight just for the banners and glory of the city, but for the entire Ynn River.\n\nThe Ynnic Empire, the greatest nation in the world, was brought down by the decadence and weakness of past rulers, and it would be restored by none other than the warriors and generals of Malacnar.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been crowned [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in a solemn ceremony, and many warriors were knighted and assigned fiefs, sure to protect the people of the Ynn River."

 ynn_events.3.d:0 "Today is a great day. The Ynnic Empire, the greatest nation in the world, has been restored by one of the Rzentur people, so looked down upon by those downstream once. But that is behind us, for we are all part of this restored Ynnic Empire.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] wears the Ynnic crown of the Emperors of old, cheered on by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family and closest companions, and with their shouts they acclaim [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 ynn_events.3.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"

 ynn_events.4.d:0 "The Ynnic Empire is reborn. Not from the Sarda, not from the Dolindhans, but from us, whose grandfathers settled this river valley a mere generations ago. In that time we embraced the Ynn River Worship, and learned of Ynnic history and its customs, and as our functionaries now purvey all the great monuments that the Empire of old built, nobody in the valley can dispute our succession to the Ynnic Empire."

 ynn_events.6.d:0 "Our Iosahar in [iosahar_into_tributary_target.GetName] has been acting independently for quite some time now, acknowledging our Overlordship but not our authority. They've used their distance from our capital as an excuse to conveniently forget about our edicts, our missives, and - Ynn be merciful - our party invitations, hoping that we wouldn't notice their absence.\n\nIf we don't act soon, [iosahar_into_tributary_target.GetName] may declare full independence."
