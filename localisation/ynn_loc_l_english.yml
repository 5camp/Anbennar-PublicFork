 ynn_barges.1.t:0 "The Final Journey"
 ynn_barges.1.d1:0 "For years, $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has ruled our nation. For good or ill, they have led our people towards tomorrow. Today, however, their journey of leadership has ended, and their journey toward the afterlife, their journey along the sacred Ynn, begins. If this journey is to be successful, however, we must ensure proper transportation, so as to keep our ruler untainted from any impure floating in the River."
 ynn_barges.1.d2:0 "A previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has died. For good or ill, they have led our people towards tomorrow, and continued leading as head of their family once their term ended. Today, however, their journey of leadership has ended, and their journey toward the afterlife, their journey along the sacred Ynn, begins. If this journey is to be successful, however, we must ensure proper transportation, so as to keep our ruler untainted from any impure floating in the River."

 ynn_barges.3.d:0 "The [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName], holder of the Great Ynnic Dam of [From.GetName], demands a toll from our nation if our monarch is to pass. Though many see this as little more than extortion, if we wish to properly deliver $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ to the Divine Waterfall, we may just have to pay up. However, the option always remains to sink the barge, and have our monarch pass through with the commoners, if need be."

 ynn_barges.5.t:0 "No Reply"
 ynn_barges.5.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have sunk their own barge, allowing their monarch to float with the rest of the dead through the Commoner's Gate."
 ynn_barges.5.a:0 "That settles that then"
 
 ynn_barges.6.t:0 "Our Barge Didn't Make It"
 ynn_barges.6.d:0 "With our barge stopped, we have been forced to a last resort: to let our monarch float along the River on their own. Though they run the risk of being tainted by the evil souls who may be floating in the River, at least this way they will make it to the afterlife, for better or worse."
 ynn_barges.6.a:0 "Hopefully they have better luck in the next world"
 
 ynn_barges.7.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Prevents Passage"
 ynn_barges.7.d:0 "It seems that the [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName] has stopped our barge from continuing its holy journey, leaving us with no choice but to sink the barge, and have our ruler run the risk of being tainted. There seems to be nothing we can do, and their ruler appears to have no intention of changing their mind."

 ynn_barges.9.a:0 "From yesterday to tomorrow"
 
 ynn_barges.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Forces their Way Through"
 ynn_barges.10.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have used the ongoing conflict to send troops to seize our dam, and opened up its gate to their barge."
 ynn_barges.10.a:0 "They weren't supposed to do that!"
 
 ynn_barges.11.t:0 "Ynnic Barge Lands"
 ynn_barges.11.d1:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of an ancestor has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into the lake from the Great Waterfall above.

 ynn_barges.11.d2:0 "A vessel has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above.

 ynn_barges.11.d3:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of a dead Ynnic monarch has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above.

 #Ynn Events
 ynn_events.0.t:0 "Reurbanization"
 ynn_events.0.d:0 "After centuries of decay, warfare, and abandonment in favour of the countryside, the peace brought about by our nation has allowed the hub cities along the Ynn River to know prosperity once again, reaching levels of urban sprawl unseen since the times of the Ynnic Empire.\n\nWhere once laid ruins and decayed buildings getting scavenged for materials, are now blooming metropolises whose streets draw all from Cannorian fighters to Raheni merchants, and all along the Ynn people are thanking our nation for that."
 ynn_events.0.a:0 "May this be an age of even greater prosperity"

 ynn_events.6.t:0 "Iosahar Drifts Away"
 ynn_events.6.d:0 "Our Iosahar in [iosahar_into_tributary_target.GetName] has been acting independently for quite some time now, acknowledging our Overlordship but not our authority. They've used their distance from our capital as an excuse to conveniently forget about our edicts, our missives, and - Ynn be merciful - our party invitations, hoping that we wouldn't notice their absence.\n\nIf we don't act soon, [iosahar_into_tributary_target.GetName] may declare full independence."

 ynn_events.7.d1:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has declared the Iosahar system obsolete, undoing the work our predecessors have done to establish a land of equal lords. Clearly, [From.Monarch.GetName] is seeking to restore the excesses of power that led to the fall of the Ynnic Empire! Shall someone do something about this?"
 ynn_events.7.d2:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has turned [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] back on Ynn River Worship, converting to a new foreign religion. Clearly, [From.Monarch.GetName] has gone mad, and now this madness threatens to engulf the entire realm! Shall someone do something about this?"

 ynn_events.8.d1:0 "Our Oathkeeping subjects have risen up in rebellion: led by [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], they are clearly displeased with our choice to bring an end to the complacency and selfishness enabled by the Iosahar system. It is too late to back down now, all we have left to do is crush this rebellion, and our rule over the Ynn will be solidified forevermore."
 ynn_events.8.d2:0 "Our Oathkeeping subjects have risen up in rebellion: led by [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], they are clearly displeased with our choice to bring the light of a new religion to this land. It is too late to back down now, all we have left to do is crush this rebellion, and our rule over the Ynn will be solidified forevermore."

 ynn_events.9.d1:0 "We have been bested in war and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now bends the knee before [From.GetName], pledging [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] purse. We may bide our time and throw off their yoke one day, perhaps becoming Overlord ourselves. In the meantime…"
 ynn_events.9.d2:0 "We have been bested in war by one of the Antler Lords, and were forced to bend the knee. The City of Warriors and its institutions lay at the mercy of [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], to whom we will pledge our swords and coins from now on."

 ynn_events.14.t:0 "Iosahar Returns"
 ynn_events.14.d1:0 "We have made good use of our victories in the current war, and so our wayward Oathkeeper has rejoined the fold: [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] bends the knee to us once again."
 ynn_events.14.d2:0 "With our victory in the war we have gained a new subject, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], previously Oathkeeper of a vanquished foe of ours."

 ynn_events.16.t:0 "Iosahar Lost"
 ynn_events.16.d:0 "Our wayward Oathkeeper in [From.GetName] has used our misfortunes in war to severe their ties with us completely. With the current turns of events, we are unable to enforce our claim of Overlordship over [From.GetName]."
 ynn_events.16.a:0 "We won't forget this slight."
 
 ynn_events.17.t:0 "The Dragon Kingdom"
 ynn_events.17.d:0 "The Rzentur share much of the customs and lifestyle of broader Ynnic culture, however ever since the overthrowing of Lord Trantan and the rise of the Drozma Tur faith, a wedge has been driven between the River-worshipping Sarda and Dolindhans and their Dragon-worshipping Rzentur cousins, who are once again decried as "barbaric" by the other two.\n\nEvents such as the rise of the Great Heathen Host, culminating in the slaying of Drozmagog at the hands of a Ynnic knight, have further driven this wedge, resulting in a sharp turn for the still-nascent tradition of Rzentan chivalry.\n\nWhile many knights are still employed by Rzentur rulers, individualism is no longer encouraged nor are heroic deeds emphasized, and the informal code of Overlord-Vassal relationship developed during the apex of Amacimst and Amaceped - the Two Castles Period - has been put to the wayside: the strongest Rzentur Lord rules with the title of Ladr - Duke - as a superior to his other vassals and the sole enforcer of the Dragon's will."
 ynn_events.17.a:0 "It is time to bury the antlers."
 ynn_events.17.b:0 "We will conquer the Ynnics using their laws."
 ynn_17_tooltip:0 "Every Rzentur §YIosahar§! subject becomes a normal §YVassal§!, gaining §R+20%§! Liberty Desire and losing §R10§! Trust.\nYou won't be able to make new §YIosahar§!."
 ynn_17_tooltip_really_good_idea:0 "§RYour Dolindhan vassals will not like this.§!"
 
 ynn_events.18.t:0 "Oath-bending"
 ynn_events.18.d1:0 "Our distant Overlord in [From.GetName] expected us to bend the knee, pledge our sword and pay taxes to a distant capital, but no longer!\n\nThrough some careful maneuvering, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has managed to become free in all but name, only some sending some small, modest tribute to [From.GetName] occasionally."
 ynn_events.18.d2:0 "Our distant Overlord in [From.GetName] expected us to bend the knee, pledge our sword and pay taxes to a distant capital, but no longer!\n\nThrough some careful maneuvering, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has managed to become free not just in fact but also in name, shedding the need maintain any pretence of vassalhood."
 ynn_events.18.a:0 "Outstanding move."
 
 ynn_events.22.t:0 "Visitors from Below"
 ynn_events.22.d:0 "Having for long stood on what we considered the edge of the world, the visitors who arrive to [1133.GetName] from below are usually limited to the occasional group of Boek climbers or Cheshoshi mercenaries, but today that changed: elves with pink skin and rounded ears - not unlike those of a knight - came visiting the holy city, bringing with them not just weapons and pouches, but also carriages pulled by small, antlerless horses.\n\nUpon questioning, we were surprised to learn that the majority of them were not elves at all, but a variety of species: what they had in common was that they all hailed from a farawy continent known as "Krarh Nor", the New Land.\n\nTheir carriages were filled with exotic crops, quality furniture, new and unconventional weapons, garments worthy of our ladies, even a tasty tree-shaped food item called mushroom. In exchange for their gifts, they simply asked to be let into the city, where they could witness the great dam of [1133.GetName], the sight of which had left them in awe."
 ynn_events.22.a:0 "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to [1133.GetName]."
 ynn_events.22.b:0 "Guards! Turn these vagrants away."
 ynn_22_tooltip:0 "The visitors leave disappointed."
 
 ynn_events.24.t:0 "The Dragon Cult's Last Stand"
 ynn_events.24.d:0 "“The [Root.GetAdjective] are coming! Sound the alarm!" Erethra Dolenmach shouted, running from one bell tower to another.\n\nAs the bells rang through the streets of [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName], hundreds, thousands of followers came out out of their homes. A mob armed with torches, axes, and whatever objects they could find, also bolstered by the few elite devouts to the Drozma Tur cause still remainining, now form a barrier several rows deep between the Dragon Prince and [Root.GetName]'s approaching [Root.KnightsWarriors]. Little can be said or done, as the [Root.KnightsWarriors] grimly advance, while the cultists wave their blades and draw their bows…"

 ynn_events.26.d1:0 "It is done. We have crushed the crazed mob of the Dragon Cult, and slashed our way through [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName]'s streets, reaching the palace of deviancy where the Dragon Prince was being raised and revered. Our [Root.KnightsWarriors] disarmed the enchanted gates and entered the palace's garden, exchanging magical blows of fire and water with the Dragon Cult's last defenders. The fighting continued on the inside, as we fought room-by-room, until every Rzentur in the building lay dead.\n\nOnce the dust settled, our mages determined that the Dragon Prince was dead, and presented us with the body of a teenaged boy in noble clothes, none other than the creature itself having taken Rzentur form."
 ynn_events.26.d2:0 "It is done. We have crushed the crazed mob of the Dragon Cult, and slashed our way through [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName]'s streets, reaching the palace of deviancy where the Dragon Prince was being raised and revered. The creature didn't wait for us any longer, and perched itself on the roof of the palace, growling at our [Root.KnightsWarriors] before spitting a cloud of flames at them, repelled by the water shields cast by our mages.\n\nOnce the dust settled, the dragon lay dead among the rubble of the now-ruined palace and countless corpses of our [Root.KnightsWarriors]. All the same, our surviving troops raise their blades to the sky and cheer, for few can say they have accomplished the deeds that transpired in [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName] today."
 ynn_events.26.d3:0 "It is done. We have crushed the crazed mob of the Dragon Cult, and slashed our way through [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName]'s streets, reaching the palace of deviancy where the Dragon Prince was being raised and revered. The creature didn't wait for us any longer, and perched itself on the roof of the palace, growling at our [Root.KnightsWarriors] before spitting a cloud of flames at them, repelled by the water shields cast by our mages. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood at the front, wielding a spear and charging at the beast.\n\nOnce the dust settled, the dragon lay dead among the rubble of the now-ruined palace and countless corpses of our [Root.KnightsWarriors]. Alas, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was among those who perished in the fight, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death the ultimate sacrifice for the Dragon Cult's final defeat. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] remains were swiftly attended to by the best embalmers that were accompanying our army, and trusted carpenters were summoned to craft a royal coffin and barge. The streets of [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName] are now filled with sorrow and celebration in equal measure as they await [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s funeral."
 ynn_events.26.d4:0 "It is done.

Above the dragon's carcass, stood [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], wounded, covered in blood and scorch marks, with a broken weapon and a bent armour, but nonetheless triumphant. Our surviving troops raise their blades to the sky and cheer, to their victory today, and to the victory of their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who will be immortalized in Ynnic memory as the second coming of Artorean."

 ynn_events.200.d:0 "A group of three riders bearing the banners of [Root.GetName] rode through the mist, the eerie silence of Tromseloc only broken by the squishes of their steeds' hooves on the old muddy path. Riding ahead to a ruined waypost of faint red and white paint, the captain gazed between the cracked walls, and saw the movement of antlers. "Be ready everyone, it looks like we've cornered a wendigo." The captain said to his companions, before dismounting and approaching the door.\n\nWith a kick, the old door was shattered, and the captain stepped inside sword in hand, turning to the right and raising his blade to meet the claws of the incoming wendigo."

# ynn_events.6.d:0 "The Netherfolk are a mysterious people who live beneath the enormous cliffs to our south, conducting primitive semi-nomadic lives in a land which is known to us as Posveagal, the Nether World. Contacts with them are scarce, and often limited to the legends and deeds of our oldest forefathers or the recountings from the rare visitor who daringly climbed the Southern Cliffs.\n\nToday [1133.GetName] received one such visitor, an elf named Kalin'do who brought an unusual story: while he and his tribe were out hunting, they saw an enormous vessel approach their shores, and from the vessel descended people dressed like kings, wielding tools and weapons of a quality unmatched."

All villages along this way were eventually abandoned due to a resurgence in Wendigos and Veykodan raids.\n\nNow that we prepare to restore order and emerge from the Dark Ages, rebuilding the Tromseloc Way will open up a vital connection between Dolindha and Sarda. We will send parties to clear out ruined waystations before our engineers can repair them or build new ones from scratch, paths will need to be beaten again, and communities will need plenty encouragement to move in; we will no doubt face stiff resistance from Veykodan tribes, or worse still, ambushes by wendigos hiding among the trees and ruins, which is why our efforts must be carried out with the maximum alert."
