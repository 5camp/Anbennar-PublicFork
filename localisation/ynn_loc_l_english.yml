 ynn_barges.1.t:0 "The Final Journey"
 ynn_barges.1.d:0 "For years, $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has ruled our nation. For good or ill, they have led our people towards tomorrow. Today, however, their journey of leadership has ended, and their journey toward the afterlife, their journey along the sacred Ynn, begins. If this journey is to be successful, however, we must ensure proper transportation, so as to keep our ruler untainted from any impure floating in the River."
 ynn_barges.1.a:0 "Build an opulent barge"
 ynn_barges.1.b:0 "Build an elegant barge"
 ynn_barges.1.c:0 "Build a simple barge"
 ynn_barges.1.e:0 "Just dump them in the River"
 
 ynn_barges.2.t:0 "The Dead Seek Passage"
 ynn_barges.2.d1:0 "The barge of the dead monarch of [From.GetName] has arrived at our Great Ynnic Dam of [Root.GetName]. If they are to continue their journey down the Ynn, is up to us to decide."
 ynn_barges.2.d2:0 "The barge of our dead monarch $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has arrived at our Great Ynnic Dam of [Root.GetName]. The inhabitants observe with the due reverence as the barge floats onward, nearing the dam's gates."
 ynn_barges.2.a:0 "Let them pass"
 ynn_barges.2.b:0 "Charge the toll"
 ynn_barges.2.c:0 "Turn them back"
 ynn_barges.2.e:0 "Let our monarch through"
 
 ynn_barges.3.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Demands a Toll"
 ynn_barges.3.d:0 "The [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName], holder of the Great Ynnic Dam of [From.GetName], demands a toll from our nation if our monarch is to pass. Though many see this as little more than extortion, if we wish to properly deliver $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ to the Divine Waterfall, we may just have to pay up. However, the option always remains to sink the barge, and have our monarch pass through with the commoners, if need be."
 ynn_barges.3.c:0 "We'll just open up the dam ourselves"
 ynn_barges.3.a:0 "Very well"
 ynn_barges.3.b:0 "Sink the barge"
 
 ynn_barges.4.t:0 "Payment Arrives"
 ynn_barges.4.d:0 "Another barge originating from [From.GetName] has arrived, sailing low in the water, due to its cargo: a massive quantity of coinage. It seems our toll has been payed for."
 ynn_barges.4.a:0 "Let their dead monarch through"
 
 ynn_barges.5.t:0 "No Reply"
 ynn_barges.5.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have sunk their own barge, allowing their monarch to float with the rest of the dead through the Commoner's Gate."
 ynn_barges.5.a:0 "That settles that then"
 
 ynn_barges.6.t:0 "Our Barge Didn't Make It"
 ynn_barges.6.d:0 "With our barge stopped, we have been forced to a last resort: to let our monarch float along the River on their own. Though they run the risk of being tainted by the evil souls who may be floating in the River, at least this way they will make it to the afterlife, for better or worse."
 ynn_barges.6.a:0 "Hopefully they have better luck in the next world"
 
 ynn_barges.7.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Prevents Passage"
 ynn_barges.7.d:0 "It seems that the [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName] has stopped our barge from continuing its holy journey, leaving us with no choice but to sink the barge, and have our ruler run the risk of being tainted. There seems to be nothing we can do, and their ruler appears to have no intention of changing their mind."
 ynn_barges.7.a:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] will pay"
 
 ynn_barges.8.t:0 "Another Monarch Presents Themselves to Us"
 ynn_barges.8.d1:0 "The High Priest of Chrempredpadh will soon receive another barge passing [Root.GetName], carrying the deceased monarch of [From.GetName] as it reaches the end of its holy journey."
 ynn_barges.8.d2:0 "The High Priest of Chrempredpadh will soon receive the barge carrying our deceased monarch $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ as it reaches the end of its holy journey."
 ynn_barges.8.a:0 "Let it go through"
 ynn_barges.8.b:0 "Prepare a small ritual"
 ynn_barges.8.c:0 "Hold a grand ceremony"
 
 ynn_barges.9.t:0 "Final Rest"
 ynn_barges.9.d:0 "The barge carrying our monarch has reached the end of the Ynn, and, at the Divine Waterfall, our monarch moves on to the next life, pure of any taint of this mortal realm. With their journey ended, a new journey, the journey of [Root.Monarch.GetName], can finally begin."
 ynn_barges.9.a:0 "From yesterday to tomorrow"
 
 ynn_barges.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Forces their Way Through"
 ynn_barges.10.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have used the ongoing conflict to send troops to seize our dam, and opened up its gate to their barge."
 ynn_barges.10.a:0 "They weren't supposed to do that!"
 
 ynn_barges.11.t:0 "Ynnic Barge Lands"
 ynn_barges.11.d1:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of an ancestor has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into the lake from the Great Waterfall above. The vessel, damaged after the drop, reached the shore, and inside it we found several valuables such as pots, gemstones and clothes, as well as the coffin itself, lined with precious metal."
 ynn_barges.11.d2:0 "A vessel has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above. The vessel, damaged after the drop, reached the shore, and inside it no occupant was found; rather, it contained several valuables such as pots, gemstones and clothes, as well as a coffin, lined with precious metal."
 ynn_barges.11.d3:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of a dead Ynnic monarch has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above. The vessel, damaged after the drop, reached the shore, and inside it there are several valuables such as pots, gemstones and clothes, as well as the coffin itself, lined with precious metal."
 ynn_barges.11.a:0 "A tribute from the heavens! Seize it and bury the body"
 ynn_barges.11.b:0 "Loot the contents of the vessel"
 ynn_barges.11.c:0 "Bury these valuables along with the coffin"
 
 ynn_events.0.t:0 "Reurbanization"
 ynn_events.0.d:0 "After centuries of decay, warfare, and abandonment in favour of the countryside, the peace brought about by our nation has allowed the hub cities along the Ynn River to know prosperity once again, reaching levels of urban sprawl unseen since the times of the Ynnic Empire.\n\nWhere once laid ruins and decayed buildings getting scavenged for materials, are now blooming metropolises whose streets draw all from Cannorian fighters to Raheni merchants, and all along the Ynn people are thanking our nation for that."
 ynn_events.0.a:0 "May this be an age of even greater prosperity"

 ynn_events.6.t:0 "Iosahar Drifts Away"
 ynn_events.6.d:0 "Our Iosahar in [iosahar_into_tributary_target.GetName] has been acting independently for quite some time now, acknowledging our Overlordship but not our authority. They've used their distance from our capital as an excuse to conveniently forget about our edicts, our missives, and - Ynn be merciful - our party invitations, hoping that we wouldn't notice their absence.\n\nIf we don't act soon, [iosahar_into_tributary_target.GetName] may declare full independence."
 ynn_events.6.a:0 "Remind them who rules."
 ynn_events.6.b:0 "We don't need their sword; their tribute is enough."
 ynn_events.6.c:0 "Let them go."

 ynn_events.7.d1:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has declared the Iosahar system obsolete, undoing the work our predecessors have done to establish a land of equal lords. Clearly, [From.Monarch.GetName] is seeking to restore the excesses of power that led to the fall of the Ynnic Empire! Shall someone do something about this?"
 ynn_events.7.d2:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has turned [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] back on Ynn River Worship, converting to a new foreign religion. Clearly, [From.Monarch.GetName] has gone mad, and now this madness threatens to engulf the entire realm! Shall someone do something about this?"

 ynn_events.7.b:0 "Back down."

 ynn_events.8.t:0 "The Great Iosahar Insurrection"
 ynn_events.8.d1:0 "Our Oathkeeping subjects have risen up in rebellion: led by [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], they are clearly displeased with our choice to bring an end to the complacency and selfishness enabled by the Iosahar system. It is too late to back down now, all we have left to do is crush this rebellion, and our rule over the Ynn will be solidified forevermore."

 ynn_events.9.d2:0 "We have been bested in war by one of the Antler Lords, and were forced to bend the knee. The City of Warriors and its institutions lay at the mercy of [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], to whom we will pledge our swords and coins from now on."

 ynn_events.22.d:0 "Having for long stood on what we considered the edge of the world, the visitors who arrive to [1133.GetName] from below are usually limited to the occasional group of Boek climbers or Cheshoshi mercenaries, but today that changed: elves with pink skin and rounded ears - not unlike those of a knight - came visiting the holy city, bringing with them not just weapons and pouches, but also carriages pulled by small, antlerless horses.\n\nUpon questioning, we were surprised to learn that the majority of them were not elves at all, but a variety of species: what they had in common was that they all hailed from a farawy continent known as "Krarh Nor", the New Land.\n\nTheir carriages were filled with exotic crops, quality furniture, new and unconventional weapons, garments worthy of our ladies, even a tasty tree-shaped food item called mushroom. In exchange for their gifts, they simply asked to be let into the city, where they could witness the great dam of [1133.GetName], the sight of which had left them in awe."
