 #Events
 flavor_elikhand.2.t: "A New Kheterat"
 flavor_elikhand.2.d: "As our nation begins to come into its own, the time has come to choose a proper capital for our nation. Surveyors have found four ideal locations for it to be built. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] must now choose between them, and in turn shift the fate of the nation to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] will."
 flavor_elikhand.2.a: "Silvervord will connect our merchants to the world!"
 flavor_elikhand.2.b: "Badeben will show our resilience in the face of adversity!"
 flavor_elikhand.2.c: "Rohibon will be a grand and prosperous city!"
 flavor_elikhand.2.e: "Shieldrest will overlook our expanding nation!"
 
 flavor_elikhand.3.t: "The Dalcabban Proclamation"
 flavor_elikhand.3.d: "[Review]Khetist scholars in Elikhand have long debated how to reconcile their beliefs with their geographical reality. Many have seen the sacrifice of Castanor as a feat worthy of the Khets themselves, while many common people have interacted with the native faith of these lands. It has been decided that the best means forwards is a syncreticism between the two practices. This will serve to help integrate our people into this new land, and for those already here to embrace the glory of the Khets."
 flavor_elikhand.3.a: "[Review]We shall guide Cannor to the light of the Khet!"
 
 flavor_elikhand.4.t: "A Visit to Kheterat"
 flavor_elikhand.4.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been granted the honor of visiting the grand city of Kheterat and appearing before the Khets themselves. This honor has never been before received by any in our nation, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is allowed to bring a few guests with him. The only question is who to bring along, as this is the event of a generation and will not be forgotten so easily."
 flavor_elikhand.4.a: "A few high ranking members of the faith deserve this honor."
 flavor_elikhand.4.b: "The nobility who can best conduct themselves make fine guests."
 flavor_elikhand.4.c: "The merchants with the money to bring gifts along should do so.""
 
 flavor_elikhand.5.t: "Elikhander Courser"
 flavor_elikhand.5.d: "As military developments continue across Escann and beyond, Elikhand's specialty military unit has proven to be its cavalry. Further building this military tradition of ours will prove fruitful, the only question is by what means we should do it."
 flavor_elikhand.5.a: "Our generals shall lead from horseback!"
 flavor_elikhand.5.b: "Knighted Nobility are in style."
 flavor_elikhand.5.bb: "Our mounted men charge in the name of Elikhet."
 flavor_elikhand.5.c: "Horses shall ferry supplies to our army."
 flavor_elikhand.5.e: "The cavalry shall be trained rigorously."
 flavor_elikhand.5.f: "Swarming Tactics shall overwhelm our foes."
 flavor_elikhand.5.g: "We will charge from our ships onto theirs!"
 
 flavor_elikhand.6.t: "Wonder Construction Begins"
 flavor_elikhand.6.d: "The resources and manpower required to build our newest wonder have been amassed. However, with decades of work ahead for our nation, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has considered a further measure: using magical means to speed up the process. The local Mages have given us an offer for their aid, but this likely requires a... personal touch."
 flavor_elikhand.6.a: "We will build without magic, but with blood and sweat!"
 flavor_elikhand.6.b: "We will hire the Mages to build."
 flavor_elikhand.6.c: "I shall conjure materials."
 flavor_elikhand.6.e: "I shall transmutate materials."
 flavor_elikhand.6.f: "I shall enchant the workers to work harder."
 flavor_elikhand.6.g: "I shall raise undead for additional labor."
 flavor_elikhand.6.h: "Why use one form of magic when I can do two?"
 flavor_elikhand.6.i: "A true master does not hesitate to yield their magic."
 flavor_elikhand.6.j: "I am a Lord of magic, and this wonder will show that."
 
 flavor_elikhand.7.t: "My Passing"
 flavor_elikhand.7.d: "If you are reading this then I, Entef of Wibnuat, founder of the New Wanderers expedition into Escann from Kheterata, have left this mortal life. \nI leave my worldly possessions to be split evenly between my next of kin and whoever succeeds me.\n\nI have led my people in search of a new home and life, many of whom fled from the Eliznan conquest of our homeland, whereas some came in pursuit of glory for themselves and our people. Much like how Elikhet the Wanderer ventured forth into the younger world to civilize it, we too have marched into the unknown.\n\nThat is enough about my life, you are gathered regarding my death, after all. As you know, I had brought with me my means of interment from Kheterata. This being, of course, a carefully crafted sarcophagus and materials for mummification. My last wish is to be mummified in the formal Kheteratan style, and kept within the aforementioned sarcophagus. Where the sarcophagus is kept in the short term is irrelevant, so long as care is taken to ensure my remains are not disturbed until a more glorious home for them is built.\n\nI believe in this nation, and her people. I know someday it will rise to glory worthy of the Khets and our homeland. My soul will await this day eagerly.\n\nSigned,\nEntef of Wibnuat"
 flavor_elikhand.7.a: "Ensure the highest care is taken for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 flavor_elikhand.7.b: "Store the body and let's get a move on!"
 
 flavor_elikhand.8.t: "My Resting Place"
 flavor_elikhand.8.d: "With the completion of a worthy pyramid, I, Entef of Wibnaut, finally have a place for my body to rest. True glory has finally come to this nation, and I rest easier for it. While a geometric pile of rocks may strike some as unassuming, far more goes into it than many would think. Thousands of people must prepare tons upon tons of material. The finest stonemasons must carve each and every block by hand. Anyway I'm rambling... my vantage point calls for me."
 flavor_elikhand.8.a: "Glory to Elikhand! May it's founder rest."
 
 flavor_elikhand.9.t: "My Return"
 flavor_elikhand.9.d: "Escann is in chaos, and my nation in crisis. I have rested for over a century now, but that rest ends here. Elikhand calls to me, and I shall answer. Some might call me a Lich but I am something far more capable. My flesh does not rot off of me for it has been long since preserved. My soul likewise is not corrupted by the foul energies one would associate with undeath, it is in fact burning with a passion for this nation. Many would mistake me for a divine resurrection, but I am in fact merely a mummy."
 flavor_elikhand.9.a: "Our Founder Returns!"
 
 flavor_elikhand.10.t: "My Final Departure"
 flavor_elikhand.10.d: "Despite my best efforts, I am no longer able to lead my nation. My soul departs to rest, for good this time. I will miss my people, but perhaps I will find true rest untethered to this world.\n\nFarewell."
 flavor_elikhand.10.a: "Will we survive without him?"
 
 flavor_elikhand.11.t: "Elikhander Government"
 flavor_elikhand.11.d: "There are many interest groups that build a nation, and in Elikhand they are united with the government due to a shared cultural and religious background. The time has come to formalize these agreements to secure their backing of the nation.\n\n The question is weather the nation should be a monarchy in a style similar to the Cannorian nations around it, or a Hierocracy in service to the Khets so far away."
 flavor_elikhand.11.a: "A Cannorian monarchy is Elikhand's future!"
 flavor_elikhand.11.b: "We are all in service to the Khets!"
 
 flavor_elikhand.12.t: "The Ravelian Question"
 flavor_elikhand.12.d: "The discovery of a so-called 'God-Fragment' has led to yet another religious upheaval in our vicinity. Unlike the Regent Court and Corinite faiths, these Ravelians hold a view-point of divinity that is more adaptable to including worship of the Khets. While allowing these ideas to threaten the Dalcabban church would be unwise, it may be against our interests to bother converting these new heathens, and instead allow their beliefs to exist so long as they acknowledge the divinity of Elikhet and his descendants."
 flavor_elikhand.12.a: "They must observe the truth of the true divinity of Khets!"

 flavor_elikhand.13.d: "[From.Monarch.GetName], the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName], has invited envoys of our nation to visit the monuments they have constructed within theirs. Considering our friendly relations with them lately, it would make sense to accept this invitation, though they may take the opportunity to showcase their religion. Should we accept this invitation?"
 flavor_elikhand.13.a: "Accept, diplomacy is more important than religious strife."

 entef_ruler_desc: "Entef as a Mummy uses many of the same mechanics as a Lich would. The largest exception is that it is the sarcophagus within the Elikhander Pyramid that acts as the phylactery, instead of it being in the capitol."
 elikhand_resurection.d: "Days after the my death, I reawaken inside of my sarcophagus. A duplication of my mortal body has formed inside of it in the meanwhile and my soul now sits comfortably in its new home.\n\n§B(A new heir will be created, but this heir is actually I, Entef of Wibnaut, reborn. If it says otherwise, please correct this if you have the chance)§!"
 elikhand_sarcophagus.d: "The Great Elikhander Pyramid in [769.GetName] has been occupied, and the invaders are searching for my sarcophagus. If they are left unopposed, it is only a matter of time until it is found and destroyed.\nThankfully, I've prepared a number of hazards to defend my existence. They will learn the meaning of 'Mummy's Curse'."
 entef_modifier: "This modifier is tied to §YEntef of Wibnaut§!, and will be lost if he is."
