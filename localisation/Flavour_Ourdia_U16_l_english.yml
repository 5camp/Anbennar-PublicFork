 U16_last_refuge_title:0 "A Last Refuge"
 U16_last_refuge_desc:0 "The mighty walls of Bal Ouord have been the salvation of our people many times; from the gnollish horde of the Xhazobain to the recent goblin invasion, nothing has broken these glorious Castanorian walls. Nevertheless, with time everything weakens and falls to ruin. Though still a mighty bastion, outside its outer walls much of Bal Ouord lies in ruin. If we are to survive, we must repair this last, greatest defense of ours."
 U16_rebuilt_army_title:0 "A Rebuilt Army"
 U16_rebuilt_army_desc:0 "We must rebuild our army if we are to survive in this harsh world. With enough military strength, we will be able to entice one of the heroes of the goblin invasion - Brandon Brownblade, called such for his sword dyed brown with dried goblin blood after each battle - into our service as commander."
 U16_reclaim_ourdia_title:0 "Like a Phoenix"
 U16_reclaim_ourdia_desc:0 "The Decades of Devastation, begun by some elves starting a slaughter over succession disputes and ending with an invasion of monstrous goblins, have finally come to an end. Much of our kingdom has fallen to the goblin invaders and our foremost priority as a nation must be the reclamation of this land - once the goblins have been dealt with, we can deal with those who caused this entire catastrophe."
 U16_handling_the_merchants_title:0 "Handling the Merchants"
 U16_handling_the_merchants_desc:0 "The Crathanori are the people who can most relate to our suffering during the Decades of Devastation, as they too faced the fruit of elven incompetence and goblin monstrosity. Indeed, even before the Decade of Devastation, our people mixed with theirs - the province Withacen being under their rule, yet thoroughly Ourdi in character. Yet, they are ruled over by penny-pinchers chosen by the mob, such is their corruption by the democratic sentiments of their former Re'uyeli rulers. Let us invade their land, put their politicians to the sword, seize their wealth and place the Crathanori under the rule of a true Ourdi king!"
 U16_source_of_the_trouble_title:0 "The Rotten Republic"
 U16_source_of_the_trouble_desc:0 "The blame for the Decades of Devastation can be readily placed on the Sun Elves who once ruled Re'uyel - while the Re'uyeli can be admired for having overthrown such incompetents, they simply committed a new sin after; the adoption of democracy, rejecting the rule of kings in favor of appointing the masses as their own sovereign. While their false cult of Surael could perhaps be tolerated, this challenge to the rule of kings - and, thus, the authority of Castellos himself - is simply not a sin we can permit. We must destroy the heretical Re'uyeli state and bring its rebellious people under the rule of a true king, loyal to Castellos, god of kings and laws!"
 U16_dwarven_relations_title:0 "Dwarven Relations"
 U16_dwarven_relations_desc:0 "The dwarves of the Tungr Mountains might be an excellent ally or a dangerous enemy, but they certainly cannot be a mere neighbor. Our precise relationship must be defined at once, whether it be a friendship as strong as that between the Castanites and the Stone Dwarves or yet another war against yet another group of enemies in Bahar. Either way, it is best for these dwarves to remain in their own lands."
 U16_finish_the_fight_title:0 "Finish the Fight"
 U16_finish_the_fight_desc:0 "West Bahar is ours and we have avenged ourselves on monster and heathen alike. Nevertheless, the fight continues. The goblins of Mountainhugger and the followers of a false god in Baharkand are our eternal enemy, as are all of their fellows, and we cannot stop and we cannot rest until the goblins are driven back into their disgusting caves and the Bulwari are placed under our benevolent, paternal boot."
 U16_ourdi_bahar_title:0 "Ourdi Bahar"
 U16_ourdi_bahar_desc:0 "Glory to Ourdia! The goblins and Bahari have been crushed by our superior nation. Their lands are now our lands, their wealth is now our wealth, and their lives are ours to do with what we will. For the goblins, there is no option but death, but the Bahari could perhaps become valuable subjects should they embrace the true faith..."
 U16_save_the_bahari_title:0 "Save the Bahari"
 U16_save_the_bahari_desc:0 "For their own good, we must eradicate the Sun Cult and its false, heretical views among our Bahari subjects. Only by embracing the glory and strength of Corin can mankind survive in this hostile world - and, as her most loyal followers, it is our duty to unite humanity under her guidance."
 U16_revitalized_economy_title:0 "Revitalized Economy"
 U16_revitalized_economy_desc:0 "With the reclamation of our lands, we should stabilize our economy as quickly as possible - the sooner it is done, the better we can reintegrate into the Divenhal's trade routes."
 U16_rekindled_guilds_title:0 "Rekindled Guilds"
 U16_rekindled_guilds_desc:0 "With our trade once again providing life to our economy, we can begin to revive our crippled guilds. Many of our guildmasters and journeymen died during the Decades of Devastation, and so we shall have to be less picky than usual - but perhaps some fresh blood is what Ourdia needs. Though we require a certain minimum of investment to revive our economy, more investment will see more return."
 U16_reclaim_our_land_title:0 "Reclaim Our Land"
 U16_reclaim_our_land_desc:0 "With our coffers refilled, we can now afford a massive resettlement campaign to refill our lands with their rightful, Ourdi inhabitants. Of course, we need to remove the intruding new goblin populations first."
 U16_building_a_navy_title:0 "Building a Navy"
 U16_building_a_navy_desc:0 "If we are to assure the safety and strength of our nation, we must have a mighty navy. While future expansion will be necessary to be a true titan of the Divenhal, all things must start somewhere and even a small navy will be vital if we are pursue our national goals."
 U16_western_connections_title:0 "Western Connections"
 U16_western_connections_desc:0 "With our influence in the Flooded Coast reclaimed, we can begin courting allies and trade partners in the west - the Kings of Eborthil and their gold mines are our best bet, though the Kings of Busilar and the Dukes of Sugamber would also be good partners."
 U16_dominating_the_coast_title:0 "Dominating the Coast"
 U16_dominating_the_coast_desc:0 "Our new navy offers us the opportunity to control trade along the Flooded Coast; while not the wealthiest location, it is still imperative that we direct its trade to our capital if only to deny our enemies any possible advantage."
 U16_bahari_trade_control_title:0 "Bahari Trade Control"
 U16_bahari_trade_control_desc:0 "We must secure control of the trade in Bahar."
 U16_new_ouord_title:0 "Founding New Ouord"
 U16_new_ouord_desc:0 "We have truly brought the people of Bahar into the true faith and are one step closer to our destiny of saving the Bulwari from their false cults. However, before we can continue our righteous crusade, a new capital must be built to secure our dominance - the city of Aqatbar, once redeemed from its goblin occupiers, offers itself as a perfect location for our New Ouord."

 U16_beyond_ourdia_desc:0 "With control over Bahar, and having moved our capital into our nation's new heartland, we can no longer properly call ourselves just Ourdia - instead, let a new empire arise, the Empire of Ourdanor!"
