 U16_goblin_against_goblin_title:0 "Goblin Against Goblin"
 U16_goblin_against_goblin_desc:0 "Our new and unwelcome goblin neighbors are a fractious lot, divided between the Landshark and Oubbligschild Clans. It would be very difficult to fight both of them at once, and goblins aren't the wisest race, so perhaps we can instead arrange an incident and get the caverats to kill each other for us."
 U16_sons_of_castan_title:0 "Sons of Castan"
 U16_sons_of_castan_desc:0 "Ourdi-Bahar Lore"
 U16_the_burning_order_title:0 "The Burning Order"
 U16_the_burning_order_desc:0 "Sun Elf restorationists"
 U16_contact_remnants_title:0 "Contact Remnants"
 U16_contact_remnants_desc:0 "Many of our people survive under goblin rule, and few are happy about it. With some supplies, and leadership by our knights, we could incite these survivors into an uprising against their goblin occupiers.\n\nWhile likely doomed to failure on its own, this uprising could be an excellent distraction for our own invasion - and should it fail, the rebels die as martyrs of Ourdia and what greater fate can there be than that?"
 U16_last_refuge_title:0 "A Last Refuge"
 U16_last_refuge_desc:0 "The mighty walls of Bal Ouord have been the salvation of our people many times; from the gnollish horde of the Xhazobain to the recent goblin invasion, nothing has broken these glorious Castanorian walls. Nevertheless, with time everything weakens and falls to ruin, especially while under siege by a horde of goblins. Though still a mighty bastion, outside its outer walls much of Bal Ouord lies in ruin.\n\nIf we are to survive, we must repair this last, greatest defense of ours. It'll also allow us to put our archive of Castanorian construction techniques to good use."
 U16_rebuilt_army_title:0 "A Rebuilt Army"
 U16_rebuilt_army_desc:0 "We must rebuild our army if we are to survive in this harsh world. With enough military strength, we will be able to redeem the Ourdi Army as an honorable calling in life and attract new recruits."
 U16_reclaim_ourdia_title:0 "Like a Phoenix"
 U16_reclaim_ourdia_desc:0 "The Decades of Devastation, starting with some elves inticing their peasants to slaughter each other over succession disputes and ending with an invasion of monstrous goblins, have finally come to an end.\n\nMuch of our kingdom has fallen to the goblin invaders and our foremost priority as a nation must be the reclamation of this land - once the green rats have been killed or sent squealing back into the Deepwoods, we can deal with those who caused this entire catastrophe."
 U16_handling_the_merchants_title:0 "Handling the Merchants"
 U16_handling_the_merchants_desc:0 "The Crathanori are the people who can most relate to our suffering during the Decades of Devastation, as they too faced the fruit of elven incompetence and goblin monstrosity. Indeed, even before the Decade of Devastation, our people mixed with theirs - the province Withacen being under their rule, yet thoroughly Ourdi in character.\n\nSadly, they are ruled over by penny-pinchers chosen by the mob, such is their corruption by the democratic sentiments of their former Re'uyeli rulers. Let us invade their land, put their politicians to the sword, seize their wealth and place the Crathanori under the rule of a true Ourdi king!"
 U16_source_of_the_trouble_title:0 "The Rotten Republic"
 U16_source_of_the_trouble_desc:0 "The blame for the Decades of Devastation can be readily placed on the Sun Elves who once ruled Re'uyel - while the Re'uyeli can be admired for having overthrown such incompetents, they simply committed a new sin after; the adoption of democracy, rejecting the rule of kings in favor of appointing the masses as their own sovereigns.\n\nWhile their false cult of Surael could perhaps be tolerated, this challenge to the rule of kings - and, thus, the authority of Castellos himself - is simply not something we can permit. We must destroy the heretical Re'uyeli state and bring its rebellious people under the rule of a true king, loyal to Castellos, god of kings and laws!"
 U16_dwarven_relations_title:0 "Dwarven Relations"
 U16_dwarven_relations_desc:0 "The dwarves of the Tungr Mountains might be an excellent ally or a dangerous enemy, but they certainly cannot be a mere neighbor. Our precise relationship must be defined at once, whether it be a friendship as strong as that between the Castanites and the Stone Dwarves or yet another war against yet another group of enemies in Bahar."
 U16_finish_the_fight_title:0 "Finish the Fight"
 U16_finish_the_fight_desc:0 "The northwestern coast of Bahar is ours and we have avenged ourselves on monster and heathen alike. Nevertheless, the fight continues. The goblins of Mountainhugger and the followers of a false god in Baharkand are our eternal enemy, as are all of their fellows, and we cannot stop and we cannot rest until the goblins are driven back into their disgusting caves and the Bulwari are placed under our benevolent, paternal boot."
 U16_ourdi_bahar_title:0 "Ourdi Bahar"
 U16_ourdi_bahar_desc:0 "Glory to Ourdia! The goblins and Bahari have been crushed by our superior nation. Their lands are now our lands, their wealth is now our wealth, and their lives are ours to do with what we will. For the goblins, there is no option but death, but the Bahari could perhaps become valuable subjects should they embrace the true faith..."
 U16_save_the_bahari_title:0 "Save the Bahari"
 U16_save_the_bahari_desc:0 "For their own good, we must eradicate the Sun Cult and its false, heretical views among our Bahari subjects. Only by embracing the glory and strength of Corin can mankind survive in this hostile world - and, as her most loyal followers, it is our duty to unite humanity under her guidance."
 U16_revitalized_economy_title:0 "Revitalized Economy"
 U16_revitalized_economy_desc:0 "With the reclamation of our lands, we can begin regulating the trade within our maritime borders once again. Though it's not a particularly wealthy area beyond the riches of the Gemisle, it is nevertheless rightfully ours, and reasserting our control here will prepare our bureaucracy to do so elsewhere."
 U16_rekindled_guilds_title:0 "Rekindled Guilds"
 U16_rekindled_guilds_desc:0 "With our trade once again providing life to our economy, we can begin to revive our crippled guilds. Many of our guildmasters and journeymen died during the Decades of Devastation, and so we shall have to be less picky than usual - but perhaps some fresh blood is what Ourdia needs. Though we require a certain minimum of investment to revive our economy, more investment will see more return."
 U16_reclaim_our_land_title:0 "Reclaim Our Land"
 U16_reclaim_our_land_desc:0 "With our coffers refilled, we can now afford a massive resettlement campaign to refill our lands with their rightful, Ourdi inhabitants. Of course, we need to remove the intruding new goblin populations first."
 U16_building_a_navy_title:0 "Building a Navy"
 U16_building_a_navy_desc:0 "If we are to assure the safety and strength of our nation, we must have a mighty navy. While future expansion will be necessary to be a true titan of the Divenhal, all things must start somewhere and even a small navy will be vital if we are pursue our national goals."
 U16_western_connections_title:0 "Western Connections"
 U16_western_connections_desc:0 "With our influence in the Flooded Coast reclaimed, we can begin courting allies and trade partners to the west.\n\nWhile some of our court favor the Businori for their sheer economic power, others point to the Arannese nation of Celliande as a far more natural ally - closer to our size and so more of an equal, in need of a friend against the expansionist Sugambrians and militant Toarnese, and with excellent access to the trade routes of the Empire of Anbennar."
 U16_dominating_the_coast_title:0 "Dominating the Ourdi Bay"
 U16_dominating_the_coast_desc:0 "Our new navy offers us the opportunity to expand our trade network westwards, past the Gemisle. Should we establish enough trade connections, we can likely exploit them to bring new prosperity to the lands around Bal Ouord itself, as well as expand it's great salt mines to once again export rather than simply salting our own food to prepare for any future sieges."
 U16_bahari_trade_control_title:0 "Bahari Trade Control"
 U16_bahari_trade_control_desc:0 "The land of Bahar is far more wealthy than the Overmarch to which we were banished; a land of gold, wine, glass, and most of all lumber.\n\nIf we are to control Bulwar, we must start with its coasts, and for that we will require much lumber. For our nation's coffers and ambitions alike, we must control the trade of this land just as firmly as it's people - let no ship ply the ports of Bahar without the flag of Ourdia flying atop it's mast!"
 U16_new_ouord_title:0 "Founding New Ouord"
 U16_new_ouord_desc:0 "Our conquest of Bahar is at an end. We must now take measures to finalize our integration of the region, removing any remnant goblins or sun cultists, before building a new capital from which to continue our holy crusade to secure the true homeland of the Castanites."

 U16_beyond_ourdia_desc:0 "With control over Bahar, and having moved our capital into our nation's new heartland, we can no longer properly call ourselves just Ourdia - instead, let a new empire arise, the Empire of Ourdanor!"
