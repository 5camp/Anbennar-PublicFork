 Y25_still_the_winds_title: "Still The Winds"
 Y25_still_the_winds_desc: "The Shuimu League, led by Feiten, is a somewhat newer phenomenon in yanshen when compared to our long reign here. However, This upstart confederation of city states has been growing ever aggresive and expansionist. In the Kingdom of Xiyun, they have recently incited a rebellion. With the backing of the league, the rebels were victorious and have broken away, underneath the authority of the City of Luoyip. The league likely plans on taking the entire kingdom for themselves if they are not put in their place."
