 flavor_stanyrhrada.0.d:0 "Recently the balance of power in our corner of the Ynn was upset when the upstart Lord of Trompolere, Alaran yen Cestor, engaged in a war of conquest against the lords of Sarda. Alaran managed to achieve a shocking victory against the coalition led by Arverynn, forcing the Lord of Arverynn to offer him much of his 'Imperial' coffers to prevent a sack of the old Ynnic capital. The Lordship of Trompolere also acquired wide swathes of land from its neighbours, ourselves included. While we certainly didn't get the worst of this defeat, our armies still suffered damage that will take some time to recover from."
