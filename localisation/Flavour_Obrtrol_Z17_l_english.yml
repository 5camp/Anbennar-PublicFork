 obrtrol_our_last_chance_desc:0 "Strongest trolls gathered by leader to speak. Trolls not speak much, must be important. Leader tells of Great-Fathers stories. The Ice Giants ruled north mountain and valley, built many big cave.\n\nLeader tells of stories and legends Trolls have told for all times. How Great-Fathers left the north to us. To rule. How only Trolls strong enough. Leader tells of the humans weak, but too many. Trolls must come together, make war on many human.\n\nLeader speak of second war, stronger ones come from south, make war against the valley men. Leader say now the time to strike. Trolls agree, Trolls are ready, Trolls will fight."
 obrtrol_trolls_of_dalr_title:0 "Trolls of Dalr"
 obrtrol_trolls_of_dalr_desc:0 "Old Trolls tell stories of Jötunn craved in the stones of caves. How Jötunn built the north and fell into the sea leaving north to us. How valley men came and stole what was ours.\n\nThey say what we do now will be a new story to carve in every cave. How the Jartal Agefa drove valley men into the sea to join the bones of the Jötunn. How Trolls took back what was stolen, what was theirs and always had been. Now Trolls will grind the valley men’s cities to dust and take their forts. The blood of the Jötunn watered this land once, now the blood of men will water it once again and make way for the Jartal Agefa!"

 obrtrol_take_olavslund_desc:0 "Valley men are broken. But more hide beyond mountains. Along the sea that swallowed Jötunn. Jötunn land, our land. Last cities of man wait there.\n\nWe crush them. Drive men from north once and for all. Reclaim grave sea of Jötunn.\n\nMen of south soon know giantkin wrath. Prepare the stones. Break the walls. Crush men of south neath stone and club!"
 obrtrol_brave_the_waters_title:0 "Brave the Waters"
 obrtrol_brave_the_waters_desc:0 "So it was that Jartal Agefa took to the seas. In ancient times the jötunn were cast into black seas and devoured by eating depths. Fear of the same fate rested with our kind for many ages. But no more.\n\nWe tear trees down from high places, carve into great ship to ferry the Jartal Agefa across the world the jötunn left us. Things have not always been perfect, ships sunk for sea is a harsh cold mistress, many trolls lost. Just try not to drown."
 obrtrol_urviksten_giants_forge_title:0 "Urviksten Giant's Forge"
 obrtrol_urviksten_giants_forge_desc:0 "Jötunn leave many old gifts. Forged great weapons of black ice, great towers of steel. When they drowned they leave behind much. Relics our right. Forges our sacred ground. Jötunn crafted wonders. Left the task to us. But men came. Stole land. Stole birthright.\n\nNow jötunn forge is ours again. Fires of the Great-jötunn will soon be lit again. Trolls are giant blood. Trolls remake giants' work. Build new cities. Forge new weapons. Craft new armour. Carve the mountains of the Forebares. Remake the works of old."
 obrtrol_giants_home_reclaimed_title:0 "Giants Home Reclaimed!"
 obrtrol_giants_home_reclaimed_desc:0 ""It is well known that the far north was in ancient times home to the Giants, colossi from the earliest days of the world who towered over the other races in their dominion until disaster drove them into the northern seas. The Fjord Trolls of the north believe that they are the direct descendants of the giants and as such believe they have an ancestral right of sorts to the old holdings of the giant peoples and especially sites of giant ruins.\n\nWhether this connection is true or not is rather up for interpretation as the exact origins of the troll people are shrouded in mystery to say the least. In any case much of Fjord Troll culture centres around this idea and many of their leaders have long dreamed of a restoration of the old Giant realms. No other site was more vital to that ambition than the Giants' Manse, arguably their most sacred place, the last city of the giants. Its capture by the Fjord Troll tribes legitimised both their belief in their right to Giant lands and their leaders who now were the undisputed master of the troll domains."\n\n   -The Giantkin: An Exploration of the Far North, Chronicler Torwick Aeonflux, 1781"
 obrtrol_finish_the_small_bear_title:0 "Crush the Puny Bear!"
 obrtrol_finish_the_small_bear_desc:0 "Valley men tried to kill us. Want us gone. But they fail! Trolls are stronger! Valley men wear bears on shields but run like tasty rabbits!\n\nLeader says we must finish them, take back the land of giants. Our land! We tear down huts of wood and stone! Grind bones to dust!"
 obrtrol_organize_the_tribes_title:0 "Organize the Tribes"
 obrtrol_organize_the_tribes_desc:0 ""The early consolidation of the Fjord Troll tribes is a fascinating study in the development of trollish civilization. For centuries prior the Trolls of the far north had been organised into an extremely loose confederation of small tribes and individuals led by the strongest member of the race. Groups within this body would often feud and fight each other for power and resources and many Trolls were to be found on their own rather than in Tribal units.\n\nThis made centralizing any actual governmental power next to impossible for much of their history. However the early troll victory over Bjarnrik as well as the threat to the humans of the north started to foster, if not force, a more centralised and cooperative form of government amongst the tribes under the leadership of Svala and her son Barg. One that had never been seen before, and would have dread consequences for all Gerudia."\n\n   -The Giantkin: An Exploration of the Far North, Chronicler Torwick Aeonflux, 1781"
 obrtrol_restore_the_capital_title:0 "Restore The Capital"
 obrtrol_restore_the_capital_desc:0 ""To call Murtrhol a capital city prior to the consolidations of the troll people by Svala is something of a misconception. Whilst it was certainly the seat of power for the Fjord Troll leaders it was less a city or even a town and more of a tribal gathering ground, a sacred meeting ground atop a giant ruin long since fallen into decay.\n\nThe early years of the new consolidated administration changed all that. A massive influx of trolls as well as captured human slave labour flooded into Murtrhol swelling the settlement's population by nearly three times in the space of a few short years. Whilst it still did not compare to the great cities of the south, this was no 'Northern Bulwar' as some of my more poetic colleagues would put it, it was certainly something of a change compared to the small collections of huts that stood on the same ground a short decade earlier.\n\nThe greatest legacy of this time was the beginning of permanent settlement of Murtrhol, with a series of crude but solidly built stone constructions cropping up, mostly constructed by slave labour. This would prove to be foreshadowing an even greater expansion of the settlement in years to come."\n\n-The Giantkin: An Exploration of the Far North, Chronicler Torwick Aeonflux, 1781"
 obrtrol_secure_our_past_title:0 "Secure our Past"
 obrtrol_secure_our_past_desc:0 "The old trolls tell many stories of Great-jötunn. Of great ice cities. Of shaping the mountains. Of ancient wars. Of great kings.\n\nGreatest fortress of the Great-jötunn was unbreakable. Spires that touched the sky. Was there the great kings sat. Was there greatest warriors made. This long ago. Giants long gone. Fortress crumbled into the earth. Halls are empty. Stones are cold. Snow buried the old thrones. The forges are silent. Few stones remain.\n\nWe have taken back great fortress. Leader calls us to rebuild. Spires will once more reach the clouds. Stones will be unbreakable again. Great kings and warriors will sit in halls!"

 obrtrol_prepare_the_link_desc:0 "For too long other races have looked at Trolls with disgust and pity. They say we stupid, animals, BEASTS! They look at us the same way we look at them, worthless, weak and cowering. No more!\n\nWe are the jötunns blood, kin of giant and with conquest we have taken back their knowledge. The magics of old soon flare again in the capital. We will have their ancient strength and the world will fear us as they fear the stories of the jötunn. We shall be true heirs of giants, true kings of north and men shall tremble as we call ice winds down upon their cities. "

 obrtrol_expand_the_mines_desc:0 "The valley men are broken. Weak and puny men could not beat the trolls. But they are still useful. Leader says we need weapons. Not rock and stone. Iron and Copper. Tools of the valley man. No troll ever mine. But men have.\n\nLeader says men can be put to work. Set them to dig tunnels. Pull iron from the mountain's heart, more than ever before. Make weapons for Jartal Agefa. Trolls are strong. Need be stronger."
 obrtrol_mammoths_in_dalr_title:0 "Mammoths in Dalr"
 obrtrol_mammoths_in_dalr_desc:0 ""The return of the magnificent beasts of woolen fur are a testament to the renewing power of the trolls, their favor in the eyes of nature granted them the hands necessary to return their giant steeds to the plains of their homeland, once taken by thieving men with their barbaric whims and machinations, content to hunt their majesty to near-extinction. If it weren't for the graces of the giantkin, perhaps their legendary steeds would be left as mere paintings on cave walls, rather than alive and frolicking on the fields of Gerudaghot."\n\n    -On the Shoulders of Giants: The History of Giantkin and Man, Baroness Ollyria Sursteinn, 1759"

 obrtrol_gold_in_far_gerudia_desc:0 "Men come from south, different kinds but same as all men in greed. Trolls never needed shiny rocks from men in valley, not like trolls to look for rocks that soft - no good for skull bashing. But with the opening of Zeinazmark, new markets opened.\n\nNew goods come from men in south, shiny rocks, new tools, new food! Trolls want all! Can’t just trade bones forever though... \n\nTrolls never needed yellow shiny rock before, but humans want them. Trolls never meet human demands, but people that work in mines not trolls.

 obrtrol_build_the_zein_market_title:0 "Build the Zein Market"
 obrtrol_build_the_zein_market_desc:0 "The opening of Zeinazmark marked a historic day for the masses of the south, who at this point saw trollkin as mere barbarians destroying all they touched - a humorous idea coming from the mouths of men. Once, just a mere storehouse for the bones and the wondrous carvings of the trollkin, an enterprising troll, an interesting sort whose life must be given its own footnote, independently came up with the idea to peddle these excess riches. This task was difficult due to it being almost impossible to contact any traders - the few ships that still took to the northern trade routes were advised to avoid the shores of the giantkin - and the general disagreeableness of his simpler companions did not help the matter either.\n\nThe answer came one day to the troll when a few dwarven remnants - the old enemy and tricksters of the giants before - were discovered living near the shoreline, they were nearly executed when he had come in last second, his mind expressing a brilliance that would elude most of his brethren, and struck a deal with the meagre settlement: the dwarves were to live out their measly existence in peace if they were to be the trolls’ middlemen.\n\n    -On the Shoulders of Giants: The History of Giantkin and Man, Baroness Ollyria Sursteinn, 1759"

One time chief say we pile old furs from eaten badgers and scrap mammoth pieces we not use in big pile, nowhere to put it so we shove it in Zeinazmark for the night for storage while we figure out what stews we can make with it all.\n\nAnyway, human traders come and see unused furs and for some reason ask to buy it. We try to convince with our bigger brain that it not worth it, but for some reason they up price every time we refuse, and keep upping till merchants cry on our feet. Trolls feel no pity for men, but warm tears gross on feet, so we sell to get rid of them. Next month men come back with bigger boat and ask for more furs. It then we realize we can use human stupidity to our advantage. Old mammoth skins, beaver fur, and bad parts we not use, all it useless to Troll but sell like crazy to men.

Regardless of whether or not you are willing to hear the side of my husband's kin, let me at least impart this image into your narrow consciousness: a field of children, laughing and playing - unaware of the struggles, nor the strife suffered by their parents or ancestors, merely enjoying the land as it is.\n\nFeel that joy, as if you were one of their own parents. It is simple to imagine that happiness, that joy in knowing that you have fought to give them that land, give them that space and freedom to laugh and enjoy themselves. That feeling, that sense of joy in regards to the sight of children is universal, whether one is ogre or man, troll or orc, monster or otherwise. \n\n    -On the Shoulders of Giants: The History of Giantkin and Man, Baroness Ollyria Sursteinn, 1759"

 obrtrol_a_prosperous_realm_desc:0 "It's impossible to say what the great forebears expected of us, truthfully. Though the Jotunn were great leaders, conquerors, and ultimately our creators, it has been so long since they've been around that it's just not within our right to say what they'd really wanted us to do with the remains of their empire, their leaving and what kind of legacy they'd want us to assert.\n\nWhat we can say though, at the very least, is that the little slice of the world we've guaranteed for our peoples is nothing less than beautiful.\n\nThe winds of the north blow calmly more often than they whip and twist now, the mammoths roam free and the northern plains see once more the return of the natural giants of the plains, and our people watch over this land not as mere conquerors or rulers - but as custodians of the north, protectors of the natural order that we have helped to return."

The nerve.\n\nThey pride themselves in their ability to decimate all in their paths, break through every defense and crush their enemies with little effort, and though their ability to break and crush puny humans is respectable, it's about time these we teach these grayskins some humility, and show them who're the real masters of the north!"

It is in this earth that the Jotunn ruled over, and it is that same earth where we were born, raised, bled upon to protect, and will ultimately take back - no matter how long it has been since our masters have been gone. Though many fools see these lands as a frozen waste, it is nothing short of our birthright! Our home!

They are tricky, flighty, and have grown to become wary of all those who approach them, in large part thanks to the efforts of man and their destructive ways. It is sad to see the state that our steeds have been reduced to, but it will not be for long.\n\nTales tell of a time when the mammoths roamed free in all the lands of the Jotunn, where they frolicked and played, blowing their large trunks as if they were trumpets, and playing a tune that was sugar to the ears of our kin all throughout the land.\n\nWe will prove to these beasts that the world we live in is no longer one they must fear, and perhaps someday their joyous melody will return to us, and play all-throughout the land once more."

Our giant forebears knew this fact well, and the tales of old sing of the great caste they operated under, with the greatest and largest of the jotunn having unquestioned rule over their smaller and weaker brethren. If we are to truly recreate the state of the empire of our forebears as they intended, we must recreate this system of governance for ourselves and create something that will last as long as their civilization had, if not longer.\n\nWe trolls will rule at the peak of this reforged system, our greater minds and sizes dictating our right to rule. Just beneath us are our brother-kin: the ogres, who will use their impeccable eyes and intelligence to monitor and govern the more technical and delicate aspects of state management like keeping track of populations and draell. The orcs will be the third rung of our great pyramid, serving as our unquestioning generals and zealous soldiers of our frontline.
