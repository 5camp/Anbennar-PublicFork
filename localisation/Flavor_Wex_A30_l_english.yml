 flavor_wex.1.t:0 "The Sack of Anbenncóst"
 flavor_wex.1.d:0 "At the very end of the Lilac Wars in 1443 the Wexonard army besieged and sacked the imperial capital of Anbenncóst in order to defeat the late Grand Duke of Dameria, Adénn "Skylance" Silmuna.\n\nThe Wexonard army remained for several months after the war's end, looting and pillaging to their hearts content. It is said that even during the coronation of Grand Duke of Wex, Lothane, into the imperial throne of Anbennar, that the city was still victim to Wexonard greed."

 flavor_wex.2.d:0 "Although Dameria was dismantled at the end of the Lilac Wars, its people still have not fully submitted to Wexonard rule. Small rebellions are causing waves, and with the fragmentation of Wex, it won't be long before the people rise up and Wex is embroiled in a civil conflict. Something must be done, and quickly..."

 flavor_wex.3.t:0 "Lothane sil Wex: At the Precipice"
 flavor_wex.3.d:0 "It is from a mountain's peak that one sees the clearest. Over the past four decades, Lothane sil Wex has brought his duchy to its very apex. With clever tongue, with mighty blade, with powerful magic. By seeing what ideals like 'duty' and 'fealty' demanded of him -- and spitting in their face while he stole their purse. Whatever the price, he has paid it, all to see Wex ascend. And from that vantage point, what does he see?\n\nThe same truth he has known all his life: Wex must rule.\n\nNot for the sake of power alone. Not for the sake of ambition or greed. For the Grand Duchy's survival, Wex must rule.\n\nFor Lothane sil Wex knows, and knows well: if Wex does not rule, Wex shall not be. He has been taught this from birth, an Alenic surrounded by a sea of Anbennarians. Perhaps in the past they could claw out a space of their own, though Lothane knows well how Dameria was slowly chipping away at that. But the Wexonards only came to Anbennar because a rival tribe, the filthy Gawedi, expelled them from the Alen, and the same could happen here. Will happen here, if those dogs in Istralore or Moonhaven rise, or if the traitors Lothane led against the Moon Throne turn face once more.\n\nLothane can see well the rising tide of revenge and revanchism, that would sweep him from the Empire of Anbennar's throne and bury his realm underneath. That would take all his clever deeds and bold decisions and turn them into ash. But as long he stands, he is Wex's mighty sword, clever dagger, stalwart shield. He knows that Wex must rule, and he shall make it so."
