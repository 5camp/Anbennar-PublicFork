 # Missions
 greedy_grin_create_vault_title:0 "Create a Great Vault"
 greedy_grin_create_vault_desc:0 "Every goblin in Greedy Grin knows that a large coin collection will bring them luck. After seeing the great vaults of Verkal Gulan, we have decided to build our own coin vault to increase the luck of every goblin in Greedy Grin. We will use the dwarves' designs and innovatively improve them to create a coin vault that will span an entire province and bless us with luck once it is filled."
 greedy_grin_create_vault_guard_title:0 "Create the Vault Guard"
 greedy_grin_create_vault_guard_desc:0 "After building the coin vault, we already have our own peoples first attempts to enter the vault and steal coins. So far, each attempt has been successfully thwarted by our innovative additions to the dwarven base constructions, but it is clear that we should invest in creating a vault guard to protect the coin vault from any inventive goblin or enemy that will try to steal from us. We need extremely strict requirements for these vault guards, so that they don't take anything home for themselves."
 greedy_grin_fill_vault_title:0 "Fill the Vault"
 greedy_grin_fill_vault_desc:0 "After the vault is built and secured, it's time to fill it with more coins. 50 thousand ducats should be a good start, even if it's not enough for a noticeable increase in luck. "
 greedy_grin_expand_vault_guard_title:0 "Expand the Vault Guard"
 greedy_grin_expand_vault_guard_desc:0 "After we increased the amount of coins in the coin vault, we already expected that more goblins and enemies would target our vault, but the amount exceeded our expectations. We should expand the Vault Guard to stop them, while we should also think about expanding the task of the Vault Guard to protect other important areas as well."
 greedy_grin_vault_worthy_title:0 "A Vault worthy of us"
 greedy_grin_vault_worthy_desc:0 "It's time to invest even more ducats into the coin vault and fill it with about 100 thousand ducats. This should bring us to an amount that should increase any goblin's luck in Greedy Grin. Another side effect would be that if we ever need money from lenders, they would be more willing to give us favorable loans since we have considerable reserves."
 greedy_grin_gate_to_east_title:0 "The Gate to the East"
 greedy_grin_gate_to_east_desc:0 "After taking Gor Ozumbrog, we now have free access to the Tree of Stone. We should conquer the dwarven holds within it, and then take control of the goblins that live in its caves."
 greedy_grin_tree_stone_title:0 "Into the Tree of Stone"
 greedy_grin_tree_stone_desc:0 "After taking control of the two dwarven holds of Ovdal Kanzad and Grôzumdihr, we border a strange goblin nation that worships a single goblin and has an almost monarchical rule. We should free these goblins from their chains and show them that wealth, not some goblin mage, is the truth."
 greedy_grin_destroy_chains_title:0 "Destroy the Chains"
 greedy_grin_destroy_chains_desc:0 "Having taken control of most of Tree of Stone and showing more goblins the truth that wealth is best, we now border a so-called slave state of the command, which is a hobgoblin nation that views goblins only as slaves while seeking military power. it is our duty to defy the command and show them the superiority of our wealth."
 greedy_grin_second_capital_title:0 "A Second Capital"
 greedy_grin_second_capital_desc:0 "Our conquest in the Tree of Stone and against the Command has expanded our nation by quite a bit and stretched our government. We should invest some of the wealth we have acquired in building a second capital in Grônstunad to better control the eastern serpentspine."
 greedy_grin_hold_of_gold_title:0 "A Hold of Gold"
 greedy_grin_hold_of_gold_desc:0 "We have information about a dwarven hold that is said to be made entirely of gold. Although the rumor is probably exaggerated, it probably has a trace of truth. We should go see for ourselves and capture their wealth with our armies."
 greedy_grin_mountain_of_gold_title:0 "A Mountain of Gold"
 greedy_grin_mountain_of_gold_desc:0 "The rumor was true, even if the entire hold is not made of gold, the amount of gold found in the vaults is enough to build a large mountain of gold, and the amount that has not yet been mined is unimaginable. we should stay here, because this is paradise. We also found information about another hold further west, which is supposed to be rich in gems. We should take control of the road and plunder it."
 greedy_grin_plunder_seghdihr_title:0 "Plunder Seghdihr"
 greedy_grin_plunder_seghdihr_desc:0 "We have successfully reached Seghdihr, it is time to attack the dwarves and take control of the hold to rob it of its wealth and gems."
 greedy_grin_expand_into_caverns_title:0 "Expand into the Caverns"
 greedy_grin_expand_into_caverns_desc:0 "Having successfully gained control of Seghdihr and gained its wealth as well as our gold from Verkal Gulan, we have achieved a level of wealth never before seen in Greedy Grin. Now it is time to invest our wealth and take control of the surrounding caves teeming with other goblins to increase the power of our nation. East of our capital is the Tree of Stone, which is an important region for goblins of all kinds due to its past. We should take control of Gor Ozumbrog, the gateway to the east, to act as a stepping stone into the Tree of Stone."
 greedy_grin_going_west_title:0 "Going further West"
 greedy_grin_going_west_desc:0 "Our expansion in the caves and on the roads has taken us further west to the old dwarven hold of Hehodovar, which we should bring under our control to allow further expansion in the west."
 greedy_grin_gate_to_west_title:0 "The Gate to the West"
 greedy_grin_gate_to_west_desc:0 "Having taken Hehodovar, we can now move west to Gor Vazumbrog, which is also called the Gateway to the West and will be a perfect hold to secure our nation's western territories. It is controlled by orcs riding drakes, but against our numbers and wealth they will be destroyed."
 greedy_grin_unite_middele_dwarovar_title:0 "Unite Middle Dwarovar"
 greedy_grin_unite_middele_dwarovar_desc:0 "We have taken control of all the dwarven holds in the middle dwarovar and the roads. We have also already started to control some of the caverns, we should now take complete control of the middle dwarovar to unify our home region."
 greedy_grin_domination_title:0 "Greedy Grin Domination"
 greedy_grin_domination_desc:0 "Having conquered large parts of the Eastern Serpenspine and defeated the Hobgoblin Command in several battles, we should now unite the Eastern Serpentspine under our rule and send the Command completely, to the outside."
 greedy_grin_wealth_unimaginabel_title:0 "Wealth Unimaginable"
 greedy_grin_wealth_unimaginabel_desc:0 "Having completed our vault, conquered vast tracts of land, and reformed our nation into a perfect state, we should now build a capital worthy of a nation like ours, expand our infrastructure, and achieve a level of prosperity never before seen before."
 greedy_grin_secure_food_title:0 "Secure our Food"
 greedy_grin_secure_food_desc:0 "While the gold we have obtained and mined from Verkal Gulan is a tremendous source of wealth, our people need food to sustain themselves. If we want to expand further, we should take control of the great cavern area and establish large farms of serpentbloom there to secure our food."
 greedy_grin_feeding_nation_title:0 "Feeding a Nation"
 greedy_grin_feeding_nation_desc:0 "Our ever-growing population has a greater need for food than ever before. We should invest more in serpentbloom production and cultivation to secure the food needed for our nation's continued growth. "
 greedy_grin_dominance_serpentbloom_trade_title:0 "Dominance in Serpentbloom"
 greedy_grin_dominance_serpentbloom_trade_desc:0 "Our continuous investment and the advantages offered by the Levy system allow us to produce a lot of serpentbloom already. We should expand production even further or use our favorable position to dominate the serpentbloom trade by any means necessary to establish and support the serpentbloom cartels."
 greedy_grin_system_feed_millions_title:0 "A System to feed Millions"
 greedy_grin_system_feed_millions_desc:0 "Our dominance in serpentbloom has given our nation significant food reserves and wealth gained through trade, but since much of the production is concentrated in certain provinces, this creates an imbalance where some provinces have so much, that they must throw away food while others starve. We should extend the power of the Serpentbloom cartels to more provinces and rebuild the old dwarven rails, creating a system capable of feeding a nation of millions. No goblin should starve in our nation."
 greedy_grin_peace_time_prosperity_title:0 "Peace Time Prosperity"
 greedy_grin_peace_time_prosperity_desc:0 "Having unified all of Middle Dwarovar, creating a safe area for our nation, we have invested considerable resources into the education of our people and the production of goods, which shows in peacetime when every Goblin in our nation is working for the prosperity of our nation, as we also have a clearer picture of our population thanks to our food and levy system, we can direct these efforts where they are needed."
 greedy_grin_army_reforms_title:0 "Greedy Grin Army Reforms"
 greedy_grin_army_reforms_desc:0 "For a long time now, the levy system and our food system have been working together to enable the perfect functioning of our nation, with many thinking that they are the same thing. One current problem is the right to plunder, which we introduced with the reform of the war tax system, and which often causes problems as some goblins take home considerable wealth, while others receive nothing. If we eliminate the right to plunder and instead increase access to food for all goblins fighting as levies in our army and their families during war, not only will most goblins be happy, but the number of goblins we can raise and support will also increase."
 greedy_grin_establish_levy_system_title:0 "Establish the Levy System"
 greedy_grin_establish_levy_system_desc:0 "Other nations pay their armies to sit around and get drunk all day in peacetime - a complete waste of money that no Greedy Grin Clan goblin will ever support. Instead, we will implement a levy system that will allow us to quickly raise an army for war and disband it afterwards to continue working in our mines and fields - this will be a great boon to our peacetime economy and allow us to have a cheap and numerous army in war."
 greedy_grin_war_tax_reform_title:0 "War Tax Reform"
 greedy_grin_war_tax_reform_desc:0 "War taxes are a common thing in our clan, yet it takes some effort to get our people to pay them. By allowing our soldiers more of the loot, we can ensure that war taxes are paid less by our people and instead make both our soldiers and our people happier through this right to plunder."
 greedy_grin_local_levy_stations_title:0 "Local Levy Stations"
 greedy_grin_local_levy_stations_desc:0 "When we collect our levies, we often don't know how many people live in a given area and have to rely on the word of the locals that the number of troops they send is the right one. Thanks to our food system, we now have a clearer picture of the actual population based on food consumption. Since many goblins are not fulfilling their duty to fight for us as levies, we will be setting up local levy stations that, along with the food system, will determine the number of levies each province must send, which will give us much larger reserves in war and, since only registered goblins will have access to the food system, an easier time replenishing and reinforcing our troops while being cheaper overall."
 
 # Events
 flavor_greedy_grin.1.t:0 "A Mountain of Gold"
 flavor_greedy_grin.1.d:0 "After the successful conquest of Verkal Gulan, we first had to repair it to gain access to the vaults deep below, but now that we have access and see how much gold there is, we can only marvel. The question now is whether we just take everything or just what we need for our expansion. "

 flavor_greedy_grin.1.b:0 "...in moderation"
 flavor_greedy_grin.2.t:0 "The question regarding the Gold Dwarves"
 flavor_greedy_grin.2.d:0 "After our conquest of Verkal Gulan, we never bothered with the rest of the so-called Gold Dwarves we conquered, but it is time we asked ourselves what we are going to do with them. Some advocate killing all who oppose us, which would lead to near extinction, or enslaving them and using them and their knowledge to mine more gold in the years to come."

 flavor_greedy_grin.2.b:0 "Enslave them"
 flavor_greedy_grin.3.t:0 "The sacking of Seghdihr ?"
 flavor_greedy_grin.3.d:0 "We have Seghdihr under our control, it's time to decide if we just want to take what we can, which would preserve it better if we want to make it part of Greedy Grin, or really sack it, which would give us more now but destroy large parts of it."
 flavor_greedy_grin.3.a:0 "Just take what we can"
 flavor_greedy_grin.3.b:0 "Sack it completly"
 flavor_greedy_grin.4.t:0 "Sacking of Seghdihr"

 flavor_greedy_grin.4.a:0 "That’s a Grudge"
 flavor_greedy_grin.5.t:0 "The question regarding the Citrine Dwarfs"
 flavor_greedy_grin.5.d:0 "We have successfully conquered Seghdihr, but unlike the gold dwarves, we should make the decision earlier this time, so they can't fight back with their outside allies. So the question is again, whether we kill them, or force them to pay an additional tax in exchange for good conditions and loyalty."

 flavor_greedy_grin.5.b:0 "Let them pay an extra Tax"
 flavor_greedy_grin.6.t:0 "The Topaz Throne"
 flavor_greedy_grin.6.d:0 "Our army found a throne set with topaz in Gor Ozumbrog. Some of the topazes have been lost, but it is still a great sign of authority that we could use to show the power of our leader or sell it for a fortune. "

 flavor_greedy_grin.6.b:0 "Sell it"
 flavor_greedy_grin.7.t:0 "A mysterious Seal"
 flavor_greedy_grin.7.d:0 "After the capture of Hehodovar, most of our army went in search of valuables left behind. One of these goblins found an empty office containing a mysterious seal, thinking it valuable, he took it. Later, our leader showed interest in it and discovered some kind of power that led to decrees or orders stamped with it to force the recipient to obey them.

 flavor_greedy_grin.11.t:0 "The depths of Gor Vazumbrog"
 flavor_greedy_grin.11.d:0 "After the conquest of Gor Vazumbrog, we discovered several vaults that we initially thought were similarly rich to those of Verkal Gulan, but we discovered that the vaults were constructed quite differently, not so much for defense from the outside as for defense from the inside, which confused many. We could open a vault with our gained knowledge and see for ourselves what was kept inside, or use the knowledge we gained to help us with siege work."
 flavor_greedy_grin.11.a:0 "Open it"
 flavor_greedy_grin.11.b:0 "Something feels wrong"
 flavor_greedy_grin.12.t:0 "Defy The Command"
 flavor_greedy_grin.12.d:0 "The Command, having realized that it borders on us, has sent a group of hobgoblins to put us in our place. From their point of view, we are nothing more than subordinates and should become a slave state under their rule. We should show them that their orders have no power over us and we will defeat them. Our people are gathering and are in full support for a war against The Command."
