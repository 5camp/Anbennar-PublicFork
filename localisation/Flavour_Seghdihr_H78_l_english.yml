 ######Part 1######
 flavor_seghdihr.1.t:0 "A Dark Day"
 flavor_seghdihr.1.d:0 "It started, as it always does, in the dark.\nThe skittering of claws against stone. The low chorts and clicks of their goblin-speak are a consistent part of the background noise for the Dwarovar, especially in the caves. But reports from Gor Ozumbrog started to pour in, with their patrols hearing it from further down the Dwarovrod, towards the passage which dives deep into the underground bypassing the poor quality stone and earth towards the surface before emerging once again in the Tree of Stone. At first, we assumed it was a small warband of goblins, nothing local patrols couldn't handle.\nThen the local patrols went silent.\nGroups from Gor Ozumbrog were dispatched, and the true depths of the horror were made clear. Goblins, thousands of them, pouring from the Tree of Stone! Like a living wall of filth and refuse, armed with whatever they could gather, from end to end of the Dwarovrod, moving like a wave forward, towards us. We must hold them at Gor Ozumbrog, lest we face a second Last Days!"
 flavor_seghdihr.1.a:0 "Not one step back!"
 flavor_seghdihr.1.tooltip:0 "Goblins from the §YTree of Stone§! will §Rkeep attacking us until they are dealt with§!"

 flavor_seghdihr.2.t:0 "The Old Alliance"
 flavor_seghdihr.2.d:0 "We have recently received an envoy into the halls of Verkal Gulan who claims to carry an important message from the leaders of Seghdihr, our once-sister to the west. They speak of grand plans - of an ambition to reforge the Segbandal and retake the entirety of the middle dwarovar, bringing the light of Dwarven Civilization back to the darkened holds and throwing out the goblin interlopers. They have come first to us, the only other surviving Remanant Hold in the region, asking us to re-enter the Old Alliance.\n\nWhile there may be many advantages to working with Seghdihr again, how can we forget the many times that they trampled our individual rights, overrode our decisions, or lorded their supremacy over us? To join an alliance headed by the Citrine Dwarves would surely see us as junior partners - could the benefits really outweigh the risks?"
 flavor_seghdihr.2.a:0 "Kneel before Seghdihr again? Never!"
 flavor_seghdihr.2.b:0 "To be a part of something greater…perhaps we COULD work together again."

 flavor_seghdihr.3.t:0 "Another Regret"
 flavor_seghdihr.3.d:0 "The envoy that we sent to Verkal Gulan has returned with the unfortunate news that the Gold Dwarves have rejected our offer. It was a vain hope, we suppose, that they would put the memory of our past failures and betrayals behind them, but we could not help but hope."
 flavor_seghdihr.3.a:0 "They refuse peaceful unification - but perhaps force is a language they better understand."

 flavor_seghdihr.4.t:0 "Fool me Once"
 flavor_seghdihr.4.d:0 "As Seghdihr has slowly but surely become less reliant on the Seg Band, pressure has been mounting on [Root.Monarch.GetName] to assuage the fears of the population. This has finally come to a head, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now finally implementing a large amount of checks on the power and influence of mercenaries and adventurers. By royal decree, all mercenary companies that enter the service of Seghdihr will have royal inspectors assigned to them, which continually test the combat readiness, discipline, but above all else the loyalty of their troops. Through these new bureaucratic safeguards, [Root.Monarch.GetName] hopes to ensure that events like the fall of the Segbandal will not be repeated."
 flavor_seghdihr.4.a:0 "Never again."

 flavor_seghdihr.5.t:0 "Into the Future, as One."
 flavor_seghdihr.5.d:0 "While it is true that the circumstances that led to the fall of the Segbandal would have been devastating either way, its structure was a key weakness. The fact that all the holds were independent meant they were free to refuse aiding the others. This will never happen again. An alliance no more, the Segbandal will be a union of holds, led by one Bright-King. For bright we are: five bright holds, lights in the great darkness of the Dwarovar. Bright gates, reflecting the desert sun of the Salahad. And a bright future, contrasted to our dark and troubled past. Each finger of this hand must work together."
 flavor_seghdihr.5.a:0 "And we will be the thumb."
 flavor_seghdihr.5.tooltip:0 "We will lose §Y5§!£dip£ for every province our vassals hold that isn't in their §YCapital state§! or is the §YHero's Vale§!"

 ######Part2######
 flavor_seghdihr.6.t:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
 flavor_seghdihr.6.d:0 "The scent of sulphur drifts from the cannon ranges and the thunder of artillery echoes through the halls of Verkal Gulan as it never has before. The soldiers that train here have proven themselves to be an excellent force for our nation, but local commanders believe that they could be pushed to be even more capable. Three proposals for specialised training have been put forth by the commanders of the soldiers here - We could focus on anti-infantry techniques with grapeshot, improve the mobility of our artillery and our general tactical training, or pour our efforts into perfecting massive siege cannons to shatter enemy fortifications. These are all valuable initiatives, but we can only focus on one."
 flavor_seghdihr.6.a:0 "Grapeshot will greet our enemies on the field."
 flavor_seghdihr.6.b:0 "Well placed shots and manoeuvrable artillery will ensure no position is unassailable."
 flavor_seghdihr.6.c:0 "Sheer firepower will break any wall that stands before us!"

 flavor_seghdihr.7.t:0 "Eternal Watch"
 flavor_seghdihr.7.d:0 "The Garrisons are restored at Gor Ozumbrog, and the soldiers that train here have the opportunity to learn specialised tactics that will make them a great asset to our nation. Three proposals for specialised training have been put forth by the commanders of the soldiers here - We could focus on drilling our soldiers to march and move with extreme swiftness, to take and hold positions with stubborn ferocity, or to harass and sabotage our foes with asymmetric warfare. These are all valuable initiatives, but we can only focus on one."
 flavor_seghdihr.7.a:0 "Speed is everything. We move like lightning!"
 flavor_seghdihr.7.b:0 "Let them break against our positions like waves crashing on the shore!"
 flavor_seghdihr.7.c:0 "They shall fall to a thousand cuts from blades unseen!"

 flavor_seghdihr.8.t:0 "Final Verdict"
 flavor_seghdihr.8.d:0 "The matter of the Seg Band is too complicated to solve in complicated manners. The grudges, the mistrust, the hatred… It does not disappear with reforms and laws. For the grudges to die, the Seg Band must die. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has given the order that the mercenary company be dismantled immediately, with every member being given the choice: join the army, or leave forever. The suspicions will undoubtedly carry over to the individual members, but these grudges should not survive a generation. The symbol they stood for is gone. At last, we may move forward."
 flavor_seghdihr.8.a:0 "Their mercenary days are over."
 flavor_seghdihr.8.tooltip:0 "The §YSeg Band§! mercenary company will be §Rdisabled§!"

 flavor_seghdihr.9.t:0 "A Peerless Army"
 flavor_seghdihr.9.d:0 "While we will ever aim to improve it, we have at long last assembled an army worthy of the Segbandal. Loyal to crown, not coin. An army that knows no fear, doubt, or weakness. The memories of the fall of the Segbandal will never fade, but we now have the instrument that will prevent its repeat. An army that will never fail"
 flavor_seghdihr.9.a:0 "Never again."


 flavor_seghdihr.10.t:0 "Standing Strong"
 flavor_seghdihr.10.d:0 "The sounds of marching and training echo through the barracks and war halls of Seghdihr, the resolve of our soldiers being strengthened to the utmost. Those who train here have the opportunity to learn specialised tactics that will make them a great asset to our nation. Three proposals for specialised training have been put forth by the officers in charge of training - We could focus on improving the fighting spirit of our companies, improving the skills of our officer corps in directing defensive tactics, or mental conditioning to ensure that our men do not break. These are all valuable initiatives, but we can only focus on one."
 flavor_seghdihr.10.a:0 "Morale is everything - let our men go to war with high spirits!"
 flavor_seghdihr.10.b:0 "We are only as strong as our leaders. Focus on the officers."
 flavor_seghdihr.10.c:0 "Supremacy of Will leads to Supremacy on the field."


 flavor_seghdihr.11.t:0 "Rise of the Syndicates"
 flavor_seghdihr.11.d:0 "With both Ovdal Kanzad and Grôzumdihr safely under our benevolent overlordship, and the goblins being fully pushed out of the western Tree of Stone, members of the SGC have begun petitioning the shifting of both Ovdal Kanzad and Grôzumdihr into business-oriented locales, operated by a council of semi-independent commercial cartels, syndicates and guilds. These Cartel Syndicate states would focus on their own standing militaries to patrol the caves and roads, alongside blunting any further goblin incursions. This will spare our own military infrastructure from risking losses of quality in attempting to expand our efforts in garrisoning and patrols. With the establishments of these Cartel Syndicates in both Ovdal Kanzad and Grozumdihr, we can allow the local administrations to focus on minor problems that would have otherwise burdened the SGC, as we focus on further development of our access to Halessi trade. "
 flavor_seghdihr.11.a:0 "An excellent idea!"
 flavor_seghdihr.11.tooltip:0 "Our lands in the western §YTree of Stone§! will be split among our §YSyndicates§!"
 flavor_seghdihr.11.tooltip2:0 "We will now be able to embargo §Gthree§! §Ynon-rival§! countries with §Yno penalty§!"

 flavor_seghdihr.12.t:0 "Those that Remain"
 flavor_seghdihr.12.d:0 "There is really only one way to deal with the now leaderless retinues of the noble families: enlist them into the army, spread them out over different units, and make their pay generous enough as to not let them slip back into old habits. They may not be properly prepared for war yet, but their work for the nobles has certainly given them some solid basics."
 flavor_seghdihr.12.a:0 "They could use some proper army training."

 flavor_seghdihr.13.t:0 "The Southern Assembly"
 flavor_seghdihr.13.d:0 "The assembly hall, the largest that had yet been reclaimed in Seghdihr, was filled to the brim with invited notables and audience members from the five holds of the refounded Segbandal. Over a thousand delegates to the assembly had come for the first meeting of the so-called Segamlavad, or “Southern Assembly”, and the air was electric with talk about the many issues that faced the nation. When the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Seghdihr took the podium to deliver the opening remarks of the meeting, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was met with thunderous applause.\n\nWhen [Root.Monarch.GetName] finished their speech, the next dwarf to rise proposed a new honour to be bestowed upon the Citrine Crown - a new surname that better represents the union of the five holds.  Where previously the Citrine Kings had been styled “az-segh” or “of the South”, the dwarven assembly proposed that the kings of a united Segbandal should be styled for what they were - the heart of the nation; the az-Hargûn. The Segbandal is the heart of the Dwarovar, Seghdihr is the heart of the Segbandal, and now our monarch is the heart of Seghdihr in name as well as fact."
 flavor_seghdihr.13.a:0 "Long may the az-Hargûn preside over the Segamlavad!"

 flavor_seghdihr.14.t:0 "Tireless Training"
 flavor_seghdihr.14.d:0 "Those who train here have the opportunity to learn specialised tactics that will make them a great asset to our nation. Three proposals for specialised training have been put forth by the officers in charge of training - We could focus on ensuring our men are drilled as extensively as possible, accelerating the training process, or putting more of the population through these many combat drills so we have ample reserves. These are all valuable initiatives, but we can only focus on one."
 flavor_seghdihr.14.a:0 "Put the men through more trials. Make sure the lessons stick."
 flavor_seghdihr.14.b:0 "Let's see if we can't cut these training times in half!"
 flavor_seghdihr.14.c:0 "If everyone is trained, then we will never run out of capable soldiers."


 flavor_seghdihr.15.t:0 "Heavy Armaments"
 flavor_seghdihr.15.d:0 "Molten steel burbles and is forged into armour and weaponry at the Hargûnforge of Hehodovar, and those who march through its halls don the finest of equipment known in all of the Segbandal. Access to the high quality equipment here affords our men many opportunities to learn new methods of war, and we can tune the great production heart of our nation to produce whatever we choose to focus on. Should we have our men focus on endurance training in their heavy armour to hone their indefatigable spirit, improve our defensive formations to protect our soldiers from firearms, or dedicate time to melee combat to ensure that our skill in hand-to-hand fighting never declines?"
 flavor_seghdihr.15.a:0 "Have them march until their armour feels no heavier than cloth!"
 flavor_seghdihr.15.b:0 "Practice formations that deflect missile fire."
 flavor_seghdihr.15.c:0 "The old ways are best - drill combat with axe and spear."


 flavor_seghdihr.16.t:0 "Fit to Lead"
 flavor_seghdihr.16.d:0 "With the unification of the five holds of the Middle Dwarovar and the refounding of the Segbandal, it is time to determine where the capital city of our confederation will be. Prominent members of each hold convened in a congress in Seghdihr and, after a short deliberation, the league voted overwhelmingly to formally elevate Seghdihr to be the capital city of the new Segbandal. Though some grumbling longbeards from Verkal Gulan or Hehodovar protested, none are truly surprised - the Citrine City is where the alliance began, and it is where it will always remain."
 flavor_seghdihr.16.a:0 "We shall take up this responsibility and lead the Segbandal to a brighter future!"


 flavor_seghdihr.17.t:0 "The Segbandalic Golden Cartel"
 flavor_seghdihr.17.d:0 "“...and so, we 57 adventurers, merchants, and wholesalers representing the merchant interests of the Segbandal out of Verkal Gulan do submit to the Bright-King [Root.Monarch.GetName] to grant royal assent in the establishment of a new Cartel Charter, overseen by the Crown, to venture towards the East along the Golden Highway, to the lands of Rahen, Yanshen, Xianje, Thindikai and all other lands which touches the Ringlet Sea and Gulf of Rahen. As the Charter for our Cartel will be granted by the Crown, and we shall operate in the interests of the Crown abroad and at home, we request the right to name our company the Segbandalic Golden Cartel.\n\nOn this day, a group of business interests from Verkal Gulan have petitioned the crown to grant them a royal charter on external trade sourced from Rahen and the Far East, primarily focused upon the regions touched by the Golden Highway in exchange for the crown receiving a direct portion of all profits and proceedings, alongside as, effectively, swearing to act with the best interests of Crown and Country in mind."
 flavor_seghdihr.17.a:0 "Signed with royal pleasure!"
 flavor_seghdihr.17_tooltip:0 "The §YSegbandalic Golden Cartel§! can be managed in the §Ydecisions menu§! and also have a few §Yunique privileges§! available to them"

 flavor_seghdihr.18.t:0 "Day of Reckoning"
 flavor_seghdihr.18.d:0 "The goblin invaders spill forth from the caves, as the final desperation attempt to wipe us out, and bring ruin to the Tree of Stone once more. We shall not allow it, and meet them head on with dwarven steel and lead. As we have repelled incursion after incursion, our resolve has only grown. The Segbandal shall prevail. Our holds will finally know peace!"
 flavor_seghdihr.18.a:0 "Finally!"
 flavor_seghdihr.18.tooltip:0 "§GThe Goblin Incursions are at an end§!"

 flavor_seghdihr.19.t:0 "The Dwarovar Reborn"
 flavor_seghdihr.19.d:0 "Three Segbandals there have been. The first was in ancient history, before the rise of Aul-Dwarov. The Segbandal of that ancient age is mythical in its own right, with little of it known except that both Hehodovar and Seghdihr were part of that alliance. The second Segbandal is one that history is far more familiar with, consisting of the five holds as we know them today. It was this Segbandal which withstood the brunt of the storm that was the Fall of Aul-Dwarov, only to collapse due to the machinations of Jexis and the traitorous Seg Band. But now, we have reclaimed what was lost to us, a legacy of our own making. Let the reclaimers from Cannor in the west squabble over the legacy of Aul-Dwarov. The legacy we leave takes shape as the third Segbandal, consisting of Gor Vazumbrog, Hehodovar, Seghdihr, Verkal Gulan, and Gor Ozumbrog, and there shall never be need for another."
 flavor_seghdihr.19.a:0 "Five as One, forevermore."

 flavor_seghdihr.20.t:0 "The King and Master"
 flavor_seghdihr.20.d:0 "The Xiaken, no matter who rules, only respect one thing, and that is martial skill. In order to expand the influence of the SGC, the Bright King himself must challenge a masked representative, representing the Xiaken before the SGC will be allowed to make any inroads. Their identity is unknown, but their prowess is strong enough to represent the Xiaken in this competition. This will not be an easy battle, but it is to first blood. Our king is clad in the best armour Verkal Gulan gold can buy, with a blade forged out of the sharpest steel. The only thing left now is to win."

 flavor_seghdihr.21.d:0 "The air was still. The arena is a simple circle of dirt surrounded by bamboo groves and representatives of the Segbandal and the Xiaken. A square of fabric is dropped by a neutral judge. Next rings the sound of clashing steel as Dwarf and Man threw themselves at each other with ferocious measure. The very ground itself quaked as these two titans of the battlefield clashed against each other, throwing themselves into the heat of battle. But then the Xia monk brought forth a blade as if from nowhere, unleashing a flurry of blows faster than the eye could see, before raising his blade high into the air, and bringing it down upon the King's head. The Bright King raises his weapon and parries expertly, but the force of it makes them drop it. Before the Xia monk however can recover, the King jumps into the air, bringing his gauntleted fist into contact with the monk's jaw. The monk stumbles, and spits blood. The match was won. The King is victorious. The SGC may expand into the lands of the Xia. "

 flavor_seghdihr.51.d:0 "There have been further reports of goblin activity in [Root.incursion_target.GetName], and the general uneasy feeling by both local settlements and patrols of being watched. A goblin sighting here or there, but never in numbers enough to elicit express concern on their own. Together, however, they paint a picture of goblins scouting out the local area. For what reasons, we can only guess- but none of them are good."
 flavor_seghdihr.51.a:0 "This may affect things…"

 flavor_seghdihr.52.t:0 "Raided Stockpiles"
 flavor_seghdihr.52.d:0 "Goblin thieves have been rampaging through [Root.incursion_target.GetName]. At first it wasn't anything for authorities to be concerned about too greatly. A shed here, a caravan there, things well in the scope of local authorities. But as of recently the scale and scope of these thefts has exploded, with the most recent being an entire arms shipment to the local garrison having been stolen, including weapons and ammunition. It's obvious to see that things will only escalate from here."

We shall have to work quickly to repair the damages, and shore up defences before they come again "
 flavor_seghdihr.53.a:0 "Perhaps we should worry."

 flavor_seghdihr.54.d:0 "A horde of goblins has emerged from their hidden passages and caves in [Root.incursion_target.GetName], organised into an actual threat by force of their despicable concept of leadership. Unfortunately, this number does not even begin to match the amount of missing equipment that has been stolen or disappeared. Many of our top advisors theorize this is simply a probing attack to measure our readiness. We cannot show weakness, we cannot let them gain a foothold!"

 flavor_seghdihr.55.t:0 "They are Coming..."
 flavor_seghdihr.55.d:0 "The end comes soon. We hear drums, drums in the deep. They are coming.” were the last words of a bloodstained report handed to the commander of the local garrison from a nearby patrol post in [Root.incursion_target.GetName]. It was shortly followed by a horde of goblins, far larger in size than the first laying siege to the main settlement. A single runner had managed to escape before the assault began in earnest, bringing us news and requests for immediate relief, before the goblins can seize the province and slaughter the local populace."

Many thought they would never see the day that the gate that opens to the Seghrod be thrown wide, as the first of many bands of dwarves leave to reclaim our ancient realm. We have weathered the storm, but not without aid. The Surani have always been stalwart allies in our efforts, and now more than ever has their aid been appreciated. New tactics and ideas often permeate the human lands that touch the Suran, and we should make use of them in reclaiming the Dwarovar.

When the Surani came to preach of Surakel, now Surael, we humoured them. Whether or not Jaher was actually their god reborn or not, we had an excellent arrangement. We fund his blockade of Ovdal Tungr, and provide him the service of the Seg Band as his personal guard, and in exchange we become the first and foremost source of Dwarven expertise in all of Bulwar and his burgeoning empire. A simple, effective arrangement which allowed him to focus his further expansion eastwards, towards Rahen and beyond. It is a shame that his daughter, Jexis, did not see the wisdom of his decision, and instead turned the Seg Band against their own kin."

Such dishonesty and insult cannot stand, for an attack on Azka-Sur's reputation is an attack on ourselves, such is the depths of our friendship.

The grinding years of warfare fought against the invaders slowed their advance, but eventually the great hold of Hehogrim the Diligent was put to siege, and despite our efforts to relieve her, she was eventually overrun. Now where once proud artisans worked, engineers invented, and scholars studied, there is only a hollow shell filled with creatures that defile the holy works of Hehogrim.\n\n One faction within Seghdihr has long argued that the reclamation of Hehodovar must be our foremost task if we ever hope to preserve the safety of our hold. With our renewed strength and focus on reclaiming the middle dwarovar, the time to fulfil their request appears to have finally come.

Some of these places that were spared absolute destruction may still hold remnants of the knowledge that was kept here in days of old. We should restore the workshops, laboratories, and schools of the Engineer's Hold and encourage our brightest minds to teach and work here - who knows what they will be able to discover when walking the same halls as some of the greatest inventors in the history of our people?"

The most famous is, of course, Seghdihr, which opens near the headwaters of the Suran, allowing us access to the wealth of Bulwar, and from there, beyond to Brasan and the Divenhal. The second gate in the time of the Segbandal was the Hero's Gate of Verkal Gulan. Rarely opened after the end of the original Segbandal, it lies at the far edge of the Salahad, in territory that once belonged to harpykind and desert tribes. Now, our allies in Azka-Sur control the territory in front of both gates, and we control the territory behind. Finally, traders may make safe usage of both Verkal Gulan and Seghdihr, and traders of course, need assurances that they are safe.

When the Segbandal broke it was not solely due to the machinations of Jexis - no, the division had been growing in the alliance for years, and instead of reaching out and working with the gold dwarves, both we and they have spent the better part of three centuries holding grudges and remaining in our holds.\n\nWe know the truth, though our stubbornness has long made it difficult to stomach - we were stronger together. Our pettiness and small-mindedness damaged our alliance, but as individual holds we have never been as mighty or as prosperous as we were when united. The strengths of Seghdihr and Verkal Gulan compliment each other - our longstanding trade and diplomatic relations with the states of the Upper Suran give access to the riches of Bulwar, easily acquirable with the seemingly endless gold mined and refined in Verkal Gulan. We cannot let internal divisions bring us to ruin again - we will foster a spirit of cooperation in Verkal Gulan, reminding the gold dwarves of the many benefits we enjoy when we strive towards a common goal."

The Gold Dwarves sealed themselves in their hold when the Segbandal was broken three hundred years ago, however, and since that time Verkal Gulan has remained shut off from the outside world, their golden fortune gathering dust in the many vaults of their city.\n\nWith the rebirth of our alliance and security along the trade routes increasing, the need for the Gold Dwarves' isolation is disappearing, and their paranoia is becoming harder and harder to justify. Now is the time to reconnect the Golden Citadel with the outside world, the time to reopen the Hero's Gate and welcome the traders and merchants back. The markets of Verkal Gulan shall be filled with the exotic goods of foreign traders once again, its roads guarded by stalwart warriors who fend off attacks by harpies and bandits, and its gold shall grease the wheels of commerce instead of being locked away in darkness."

Gor Ozumbrog broke with the Segbandal, and the Seg Band, and by extension Seghdihr, strong-armed Verkal Gulan and Hehodovar in a punitive expedition that went far further than it should ever have.

Despite our differences, we are linked by a bond of kinship and brotherhood, and Seghdihr should not lord over our kin as if they are a conquered people.

The newly rechristened az-Hargûn dynasty has seen the requests by the inventors and smiths of the hold as an excellent opportunity to make their beneficence known, and plans have been drawn up to build an appropriately great forge in the industrial heart of Hehodovar. The forge will be the beating furnace that pumps forth the molten steel that is the lifeblood of the Segbandal, and it will stand as a symbol of the grandeur of the dynasty as well."

 seghdihr_way_preparation_desc:0 "Knowing your enemy is half the battle, and ensures that the second half - the part in which the killing happens - occurs on favourable terms. Gor Vazumbrog's paranoia has translated into producing soldiers that have been put through countless hypotheticals and survival training methods, while the hold itself has focused on logistics and resource stockpiling. Though they may be a bit too certain that they will need all of these techniques, there is no denying that their soldiers are well prepared for many challenges, and we should encourage methods that produce such results."

Hehodovar embodies this tenacious strength, and its great forges and many engineers strive tirelessly regardless of the conditions that our nation finds itself in. Those warriors who fight here are imbued with this spirit, and they will learn endless endurance in the heaviest and strongest armour in the dwarovar, cultivating a strength so great that they will never feel encumbered, even when they carry the whole of the Segbandal on their backs."

Traders carrying exotic goods past our gates provided our ancestors the opportunity to access the luxuries of distant Haless and the Divehal sea despite our remoteness. As we re-emerge onto the world stage, we have the opportunity to once again involve ourselves in the trade that flourishes along the Golden Highway. At the strategic bottleneck of the ancient Harpy's Gate, we can establish a trading outpost to facilitate the flow of goods to the otherwise inaccessible Verkal Gulan, trading the treasures of the Golden Citadel for the rich silks and spices of Rahen before they even reach Azka-Sur."

One that we have recently been introduced to is coffee -  a bitter fruit that can be brewed into an invigorating drink favoured by mages, the humans of Azka-Sur have had some success in planting it among the foothills of the Serpentspine.

Further investments in the rail networks and restorations of the surface highways will only grease the wheels of commerce to ever-greater heights - it may be expensive, but the prosperity that these investments bring will be worth it in the long term."

Access to the Western Gulf of Rahen will be key in securing trade coming from there, which means ensuring that merchants along the Golden Highway are coming to us, and not elsewhere. The most important key in all of our plans in extending the Golden Cartel's influence, regardless, is Davharral. Its size betrays the importance as a place where Rahen and Bulwar meet. Our improvements in the region may be a start, but a concerted effort involving those governing the city will be required in order to properly ensure both accurate charts can be acquired of Rahen, as well as a safe location to further send caravans and business ventures."

Great tombs carved into the earth for those whose remains can be saved, pillars climbing up to the mountain peaks and deep into the earth for the names of those whose bodies could not. Finally, for the uncountable forgotten, perished, a hall of a thousand blank faced statues- man, woman and child alike. The Hall of the Unknown Fallen.

 estate_burghers_sgc_merchant_training:0 "Expand Merchant Training Programs"
 estate_burghers_sgc_merchant_training_desc:0 "The profession of merchant is not a simple one, and most that wish to enter tend to pick up on the finer details by serving as apprentices under senior merchants. This is usually only achieved by those of already affluent backgrounds, which leads to a limited pool of merchants. Through funding the apprenticeships of promising young and poorer talent, we can significantly expand the amount of merchants available to us."
 estate_burghers_sgc_foreign_power:0 "Enforce Tolerant Practices"
 estate_burghers_sgc_foreign_power_desc:0 "Religion and bigotry are bad for business, as every merchant knows. This concept is not always entirely put into practice, however, as perfectly good trade ventures are snubbed by merchants that are not quite comfortable with their prospective trading partners. The appointing of royal inspectors to oversee this may ensure that these merchants do not let their personal feelings get in the way of good profit."
 estate_burghers_sgc_advanced_wagons:0 "Supply Larger Caravans"
 estate_burghers_sgc_advanced_wagons_desc:0 "Old dwarven merchant wisdom states that the larger an operation is, the more its process can be streamlined to reduce the cost of individual goods. Especially with identical trade goods of predictable value, more tends to be better, which is something that the Dwarovar rail has always excelled at when it was in operation. We ought to apply these principles to the caravans of the Segbandalic Golden Cartel, and transport our trade goods in bulk."
