    flavour_shalazar.1.d:0 "Irize Starshield, hero of the last war against Ashhama, through whose efforts we were able to take back our city, holds high position in the ancient city. The rumours say that only thanks to her resilent defence the old kind Itros Moonwarden survived Ashhama assault. Irize was offered the place of a closest advisor by the king, and from this place she is effectively running the city. City guard is strictly drilled and vigilant, guarding the citizens from the monsters, hiding in the ruins of Old Shalazar. The city is safer than it ever has been in a long time… But a lot are concerned about how tight the hold of the Shield of Shalazar is becoming, and are not looking forward to her succeeding the old childless king."

    flavour_shalazar.2.d:0 "This day the old king Itros Moonwarden did not wake up. The lifeless body passes from the royal palace to the coast of the lake to be ritually burned, and to allow the soul of the king to leave Halann and join our god in the star skies.\n\nHowever, as the flames consume Itros' body, more and more grounded fill the thoughts of the citizens - who will be the heir to the old kind? His loyal, terrifying advisor? Her glory of the hero is fading away and gets replaced with fear and hatred of the tyrant. Cruelty and draconic orders cost Irize a fair bit of her popularity and made her a scarecrow in the eyes of the people she swore to protect. But there is still hardly anyone more influential then her in the city... \n\nAs these uneasy thoughts fill people's minds, snake-like figure approaches the pyre. Zazhar Moonwarden, the only surviving child of the king, and the naga. Two things that are incompatible with each other. Nagas are spiritual guides of our people, they guide our souls, not our actions. A naga, becoming a king, there is hardly a bigger sin. But as his soothing words calm people down, as he speaks passionately about his father, as he speaks about wishing to guide our city, many start to wonder - is it a sin to have a strong and powerful king?"
