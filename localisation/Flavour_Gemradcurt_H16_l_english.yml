 gemradcurt_dead_trial_at_darblath_desc:0 "The news of Eighard's great disaster at Minnorac was good to be sure, but despite the death of their ruler, Andrall Harvestcrown, their city stood tall, and they have been recovering their strength ever since. But the Icewarded-Walls of Darblath are not unbreakable - with the Winter united, it is time for Gemradcurt to lead the charge in destroying one of its most perfidious foes.\n\nAnd, of course, Immarel has her own mission. As her power grows, spurred on by the Everfrost Prince, she has gained access to even greater arcane power - especially in the forbidden field of necromancy. While she used some of this during her initial counter-attack against the Autumn, she has yet to trial these powers on a large scale - and the devastated remains of Darblath seem just the place."

 gemradcurt_the_taigan_supremacy_desc:0 "Immarel Winterswrath has enjoyed a close and intimate relationship with the Taigan Order, which was previously only responsible for the arcane education of young women within Gemradcurt's borders. After she rose to power, however, nobody had expected the extent to which she would empower and expand the role of her order. Membership was expanded to include men, and the Order gradually consumed more and more responsibilities within the country. However, this process is not yet complete - in order for Immarel and Gemradcurt to protect the nation and the Winter, the Taigan Order must reign supreme over the country, so that her authority and power may be absolute."

Immarel has recieved plans from her fey patron, and has already set her resources to the task of creating a device to bring about a change in the power balance of Eordand forever, a machine that will secure the Winter's survival.\n\nTo this end, she has begun the construction of the Frostspear, a massive tower of twisting metal and ice that shall be seen by all for miles around - and underneath that tower, work has begun on a chamber that shall contain the very heart of winter..."

 gemradcurt_unite_the_winter_desc:0 "When the hated Autumn first began their forays into our lands, the Winter Court stood disunited, seemingly oblivious to the mortal peril they were in. Even as the realms of the east fell, and the Tuathak despoiled our native lands, the nations of the north fought alone, too proud to see that united they would stand a far better chance. It cost us dearly.\n\nAnd yet even now, with the Autumn's unity shattered at Minnorac, many within our sister-realms of Gelcolle and Reotcrab have seemingly put down their arms, and refused to take the steps necessary to protect our way of life - and to make matters worse, there are even whispers that Gelcolle would dare to consort with the enemy in Raithtall. To Immarel, this disturbing news has shown to her clearly what is to be done - if the Winter is to be saved, the Winter must be united. And if that must be brought about by force, so be it."

Despite this, however, there still remains a sizeable minority of both autumn worshipers and Tuathak folk themselves - if these lands are to truly be restored to their former beauty, these invaders must be expelled."

But still, our job is not finished. If we are to avoid another catastrophe like this again, we must marshal our resources once more, and strike deep into the heart of Autumn! With whatever means necessary, the future and destiny of our people and faith will be won - and the Everfrost Crusade will see it so."

 gemradcurt_the_long_night_desc:0 "The Winter lies victorious over the hated Tuathak, and even now our soldiers scour the remains of our defeated foe, purging those who would stand against us and turning as many people as possible towards the light of our faith.\n\nBut still, there exists grave threats to our future prosperity - there have been concerning murmers from the east of a "dragon god", and even now those in the south rally against us, and sharpen their blades in anticipation of an attack. And not to mention the threat from within our borders - disregarding the Tuathak remnants, there have been concerns raised about our own people, who chafe under our rule, some openly criticising our new, aggressive Winter Court.\n\nBut the Everfrost Prince has given Immarel a solution to this - personal powers unimaginable, so that she may secure the survival of Winter forever, and so that the Snecboth will never again see the devastation of the Hibernal Crusade. And with the instruments of life gathered around her, and the resources of the North under her control, the previously insane requirements of this ritual of his have become more achievable by the day. If Immarel is to secure the future of winter forever, perhaps this most drastic step must be taken?"

She had declined, feigning tiredness, but in reality she was simply shocked. The decades long struggle against the hated Autumn had been ended by Peitar hands, not by that of the Snecboth.\n\nFor a time Immarel was thankful, but as the Strutmari's grip on the Snecboth lands of Imatt and Fasacglan tightened, her mood soured. Now, the path forward has become clear to her - winter alone must secure its future, not rely on the charity of those who would otherwise seek to shackle it. The lands under Strutmar's control must be retaken by force - after that, who can say what will happen to its Peitar occupiers?"

For too long, the tenets of the Winter Court have been weak passivity and defensiveness. Patience and inactivity that nearly fatally weakened us when we faced our most bitter struggle against the Autumn. Over the years, the people of Winter have begun to break out of that mindset, with Immarel leading the charge in Gemradcurt, but the time has come to spread this new worship of winter across our realm, so that we may never again face a disaster like the Hibernal crusade."

The Everfrost Crusade, Winter's righteous campaign into the heart of Autumn, has been wildly successful, and now Immarel stands on a defeated and broken people, chased to their last bastion at Einnsag, who had proclaimed themselves the successors of Eighard's legacy as the leaders of the Autumn Court.

While there is no doubt that they must be convinced of the supremacy and brilliance of winter, there remains the question of how best to deal with these cultures in the south - thankfully, in our dealings with the Tuathak and northern Peitar, we have already shaped the path we will take - no matter what, all of Eordand will be united under Immarel's new "Everfrost Court.""

Not only did Jahainar Truespear's expeditionary force assault her from the forest, and not only has the Domandrod proved to be an incredible tool for the Eordand Fey to strike down those it views as too dangerous (as seen as Minnorac or Dorcurt) the forest represents the last and most powerful remnant of an Eordand that was, where the winter did not reign supreme. This cannot last.\n\nImmarel has, with the aid of the Order of Arcane Sciences and the gifts of the Everfrost Prince, finally gathered the resources she needs in order to break down the walls and wards of the Domandrod, and seize the groves for herself. The population of the Old Forest has swelled from the many, many refugees that have streamed into it during and after Immarel's conquest of Eordand, and they will surely sally out to face us, and harass us once we enter the forest, but that is no matter - Gemradcurt and the Everfrost Court shall claim what is rightfull hers!"

The Peitar have had great success by retreating deep into the forest and harassing our forces in lightning raids. Every day, men and materiel are lost, as the terrain has proved a great obstacle to our undead soldiers, and our living ones dread being assigned to a place they see as a death trap. But this cannot last - despite the obstacles, our settlements in the forest push ever inwards, and it is only a matter of time before we secure our rule in the Domandrod for good. By constructing fortifications throughout the forest, and pacifying the population, Immarel shall be at last the new mistress of the Domandrod."

The Domandrod has long been thought to be rich in resources, selfishly hoarded by the fey and their peitar favourites, and the Order of Arcane Sciences's surveys in the region have only confirmed our suspicions. By constructing a series of plantations within the forest, where petty and political prisoners alike shall labour under the canopy in order to extract the forest's resources, we shall greatly enrich ourselves."

Under her direction, the boffins at the Order of Arcane Sciences have completed their first trials on infusing elven bones with metal through a complex transmutation spell, though only Immarel has the power and skill to attempt to refine the spell so that it works on its desired target - an undead skeletal soldier.\n\nThough the field of transmutation is shunned by the Everfrost Prince, the idea of legions of steel soldiers marching in lock-step through the streets of Gemradcurt has captivated Immarel's mind, and she has been awaiting its upcoming trial with giddy anticipation - her new "Rite of Steel and Bone" will allow her to fulfil that dream, and if it requires some transmutation magic to do so, what's the harm?"

 gemradcurt__original_purpose_restored_desc:0 "When Immarel was admitted into the Taigan Order, it was of minor stature compared to the Moraine and Tarn orders, only being responsible for the arcane education of young women. When the Lady Mother took power, and she had first expanded the Order's power by allowing the admission of young men with arcane potential as well, nobody had expected that it would be the first act in the Order's meteoric rise to power. By the end of the Everfrost Crusade, the Order controlled nearly all functions of the Gemradcurter state.\n\nBut this great expansion in the Order's remit and duties came at a cost - it's original purpose of arcane education was sidelined as order manpower was increasingly drawn to other projects. If Gemradcurt is to maintain a large base of skilled mages with which to uphold its magical requirements and duties, then it must turn the Taigan Order back towards it's old purpose. To that end, an Arcane Academy shall be established in the archives of Arakeprun."

 gemradcurt_shelter_from_the_storm_title:0 "Shelter form the Storm"
 gemradcurt_shelter_from_the_storm_desc:0 "When the second and third years of the civil war passed with barely two weeks of summer, the reports from the capital of a swirling maelstrom of magical power in the clouds above the Frostspear grew ever more worrying for those who challenged Immarel's rule. After the end of the Red Winter, the words of Immarel put all doubt to rest - the winter was her doing. Across Gemradcurt, only for a few months of the year did the temperature rise high enough for agriculture to be sustained, and for much of the rest, the world fell under darkness.\n\nThe worst effects of the winter were countered only by careful preparation. Fortifications were constructed to store grain, warmed by magic, and houses were reinforced against the Everfrost. In many places, the Red Winter had "corrected" the population in favour of the new situation. But if Gemradcurt is to remain prosperous, this is no good solution - we must devise a way for the greater population to be protected from the icy grip of winter. And, thankfully, bright minds have just the solution: the "Hearthwards", a series of complex enchantments and spells designed to protect an area from the glacial onslaught of cold, and allow for sustained farming throughout the year - a state-provided shelter from the storm."

Already, members of the educational staff at Arakeprun have been working on less expensive (though less powerful) Hearthwards, that may be constructed much more easily than their greater counterparts. They have seen great success, and have petitioned the Lady Mother for increased funds for the project.\n\nIn response, Immarel has gone even further than their original request. Seeing the usefulness of their endeavours, she has ordered the formation of a new "Order of Arcane Sciences", headquartered in Arakeprun but with branches in Gemradcurt and Murdkather. Combined with the increasing development of the sources of Precursor Relics so prominent in the region, the OAS will have ample resources to enhance and advance our technological abilities, including their lesser Hearthwards project that may prove to revolutionise Gemradcurt's economic situation..."

Now, they have come to Immarel again with another brilliant new idea - with extensive application of both lesser and greater hearthwards, and the necessary infrastructure and population within a city to support them, they believe that they can create a "Hearth-City", havens in the winter from which extensive urban populations can thrive, so long as they are supported by the rest of the population. If seen through, this project might be able to give Gemradcurt the edge it needs to compete with the more populous and prosperous nations of the world."

But as Immarel's power has grown, the Frostspear's facilities have become inadequate for the administration of such a large realm. Therefore, Immarel, with the aid of the premier architects of the OAS, has devised plans for a new building that will form the centre of her realm - the Lady Mother's Tower.\n\nAn imposing structure, likely the tallest in North Aelantir and perhaps the world, the Lady Mother's Tower will be a pyramid-shaped shard of ice, metal and glass, towering into the skies and casting a heavy shadow over the streets of Gemradcurt. Reinforced and protected by Immarel's magic, every floor will have ample space for government and Order civil servants to work in, the building's floor layout inspired by the halfing "house-stacking" methods learnt from Cannorian traders. In addition to this, an extensive underground network of every arcane and industrial facility imaginable will be built below the tower, so that Gemradcurt will once again be the beating heart of the nation's undead military. From her office at the very highest floors of the building, the lady in the high tower will have her entire realm at her fingertips."

We know that is not the case - our eastwards expansion is merely defensive in nature, and we have no need to threaten the human colonists to our south. Therefore, in order to secure our place on the continent, and protect our nation from the potential reprisals of our ignorant and frightened neighbours, we must take it upon ourselves to educate the Cannorians of Aelantir that we are, above all else, a respectable power."

While the Eiganrac's pre-existing military division, the Eiganrac Riders, has proven sufficient until now, we cannot ignore the increasing demands on us - and luckily we have the perfect candidate to achieve this end.\n\nThe "Everwinter Brigade" of the Eiganrac Order's military wing have proven their worth time and time again on the Expanse, repeatedly routing and defeating Epednar raids decisively and with great speed. Nicknamed "the Everwinter Knights" for their tenacity and noble spirit, that resembles the Ynnic cavalry we have fought time and time again near the great river, we shall expand this group into a new division of "Everwinter Riders", so that they may be another sword-arm of Immarel's will."

 gemradcurt_armour_of_winter_desc:0 "The Eiganrac, formed during the chaos and destruction of the Red Winter, has quickly risen to become the armour of winter, a precious resource for Immarel's efforts to maintain control over Gemradcurt, so that a catastrophe like the Red Winter can never happen again. However, on top of the order's issues with underfunding, their position under the control of the Taigan Order has reduced their efficiency, as both an extended chain of command and the Taigan Order's expansive mandate has made their operations slow and unwieldy.\n\nIn order to fix these issues, Alwaron Ferwylt, a prominent figure in the Eiganrac nicknamed the "Jester" for his previous occupation, devious mind, and impressive command over illusion magic, has presented a series of proposals for expanding and enhancing the organisation. By forming an entirely new "Eiganrac Order", whose Esbagg answers directly to Immarel, increasing the funding given to the new order and enhancing and expanding the Eiganrac's purview and powers, he hopes that they will prove an essential asset to the security of the realm - perhaps Immarel should take the young man up on his suggestions?"

By sending them to the Reokests, where they may work off their sins and sentence, and be transformed into upstanding citizens of Gemradcurt, these prisoners may be rehabilitated and sent back to their families!\n\nAnd besides, were they to fall, or succumb to the not-so-stellar conditions of these camps, there are ample Eiganrac officers nearby ready and willing to resurrect their corpse as compensation.

These rumours and whispers, recently confirmed by Snecboth scouts, have greatly worried Immarel - if the Winter is to be protected, we must be embark on a long march east, in order to claim the resources of those frontiers for ourselves, and deal with any threats to Gemradcurt that may exist beyond the mountains."

As evidenced by the passage of the Istralorian Crusaders and the Themarians, this passage can surely be used to assault us from the north, and so it must be secured.\n\nBesides these two other factors, the third is one more personal to Immarel - the Everfrost Prince has called on her to claim the region, so that, in his words "a treasure of the past may reveal itself."

And, to that end, we shall construct a grand home for said fleet, the Reotcal, or "frozen harbour", from which our power may be projected across the waves."

 flavor_gemradcurt.1.d:0 "Immarel considered the words of the scout as she sent them out. A renegade band of a few hundred Hibernal Crusaders, the marauding remains of that bloody war. When Immarel had driven out the Tuathak from Gemradcurt, and the Peitar had killed Harvestcrown at Minnorac, many presumed the Hibernal Crusade - the existential threat to winter that had consumed the north of Eordand - over and done with. Immarel knew better. The Tuathak would not stop until the Winter Court was exterminated. Even now, remnants of the Autumnal armies still remained in Snecboth territory, looting and killing to their hearts content. They had to go on the offensive to see winter secure, that was for certain...\n\nA man's voice, slow-paced and clear as ice, interrupted her musings - Immarel turned to face the sound. Before her stood an elven-looking man, his skin a pure white and his hair and bright eyes an icey blue. Clad in furs and ornate snow-white armour, he was beautiful, appearing as some divine link between the Winter and elvenkind. The Everfrost Prince, her patron, stood before her. An Archfey.\n\n§d"You will ride out against the Autumn - but do not forget what I told you before. Beyond the means of destruction lies a far higher power..."§!\n\nImmarel knew what he was talking about - necromancy. It had served her well during her counter attack, very well indeed, but even now she found its use distasteful. It was a weapon, nothing more. Immarel turned back to her desk and retrieved a quill and paper - orders. She shook her head as she began to write. "These bandits can be dealt with by spear and snow alone."\n\n§d"They can indeed. But can every threat to winter? You view those arts as something to be used only in war, but what if I told you that behind that is something that can secure your people's survival forever... craft a winter eternal... and grant you eternal personal power besides."§!\n\nAt that, Immarel's quill-hand stopped mid-sentence. Eternal power... with something like that, the Winter Court might never see another catastrophe like the Hibernal Crusade again - she could destroy the Autumn entirely, and any other threat to the Snecboth that presents itself... Immarel turned back towards the Archfey."

 flavor_gemradcurt.6.d:0 "In the Great Hall of the village of Daidh, a massive host was assembled. Hundreds of Snecboth warriors, nobles and burghers had joined Immarel and the Whitehand and Winterstrider rulers of Gelcolle and Reotcrab, in celebration of the unity of the Winter Court and the Snecboth people in their fight against Winter. Meat, drink and merryment was abound - even Immarel, normally stoic and always fixated on some goal or other, seemed totally at ease. But, as with that stoic and calm demeanour, this was but a facade over her true feelings. In truth, she was nervous. There were constant rumblings in her circle about the disloyalty of Gemradcurt's comrades in arms, and some even wished for them to be brought under Immarel's personal control entirely - and, of course, there were many among the vassal's people that chafed under the Taigan Order's control. When one of these advisors, a high ranking member of the Taigan Order, had approached her the night before with a plan to wipe out the leadership of Gelcolle and Reotcrab at the great feast, and secure Gemradcurt's authority over the north in one fell swoop, she had waved him away - but she had not denied him. She knew, even as she played the merry ally of the two Dukads on the dais, many Gemradcurters in the room had their eyes on her - waiting for a signal to strike.\n\nAbruptly, Immarel stood up and called for quiet. The Gemradcurters did so quickly, as if they had just been ordered to do so by a commadning officer, but the Gelcollers and Reotcrabers took some time to get settled. She raised her glass to the assembled Snecboth. "10 years ago, the nations of the north joined together to stand against the Autumnal invaders, and since then, we have fought alongside each other as siblings. We've gained victory after victory, and now we're at the precipice of securing the future of the Winter Court forevermore!" The hall erupted into cheers - after it died down, Immarel continued. "But still, there exists divisions among us... cracks in the unity that has been so essential to our success." Immarel saw one of the officers on the tables place a hand on her sword... she only had to say the world, and the room would erupt into blood. "But that ends today! At this feast, in this hall, we shall built a brighter future, and strengthen the machine that will destroy the Tuathak once and for all! And we can only do that...""

 flavor_gemradcurt.7.d:0 "Snow fell as the Taigan Order soldiers piled the last of the Tuathak bodies before her. The taking of Darblath had been extremely costly, with the Ice-Warded Walls of the city giving Immarel a great challenge, but in time they had fallen before her and her forces, and the city was now under Snecboth control once again. Despite the cost, however, the Everfrost Prince had taught her something - behind every victory on the field lay another, hidden success. As her arcane powers grew, it had become necessary for her to trial her newfound abilities on increasingly grander scales, in preparation for what the Everfrost Prince had assured her would be a most taxing ritual. And so, after Darblath had fallen, Immarel had ordered her soldiers to gather as many dead warriors in the city together as they could - the result was a horrific affair, and though the bodies had been frozen through magic to stop much of the decay, the sight of so many dead still brought unease to some of the assembled officers. But Immarel knew, of course, that such a display paled in comparison to the numbers killed by the Tuathak. §RThis was merely their punishment.§!\n\nImmarel's guards turned with a start as a white elk approached from behind - when she turned herself however, she waved them off as the rider dismounted - he was the Everfrost Prince in disguise, an antlered white helmet over his head to conceal his otherworldly appearance. He leaned close to Immarel, and spoke with his usual glacial demeanour. §d"This is only the beginning. When you have reached the heights of power, you shall be able to command the very world as you would these soldiers. Remember this..."§! Immarel nodded, stepping forward as the Everfrost Prince watched on alongside her bodyguards. She raised her arms.\n\nThe blue glow of magic engulfed the square, as limbs within the tangle of bodies began to twitch and shudder. Soon, there was true movement - unnatural, stiff movement, as if the bodies were being puppeted by some invisible master above them. Then, the pile came alive, as hundreds, then thousands of undead began to reanimate fully. Immarel strained under the stress of the spell, as her head began to ache and her arms began to burn with exertion, but soon enough she managed to wrestle full control of the assembled host. A few commands, and the mass before her had moved into some grim imitation of an organised force. Immarel smiled."

The will of the Strutmari had been broken, and they were willing to surrender entirely. Gazing at the fortress in the distance, walls breaking, and surrounded by Snecboth soldiers and reanimated Peitar alike, Immarel opened her mouth to speak, but Captain Ishera, a trusted supporter and lieutenant who had joined the Order at a similar age as Immarel (albeit as a novice trainee), interjected. "Immarel, we should take their offer. Its no use storming the city if we can take it peacefully... and besides, these folk helped us in the Hibernal Crusade. It was the Strutmari who killed Harvestcrown in Minnorac! What's the use in-"\n\nAnother voice interrupted Ishera, as another of her lieutenants - Captain Talaran - rose to speak. "Where were the Peitar when they invaded in the first place? They only attacked when the damn Tuathak had been looting our lands for decades! And not to mention Imatt and Fasacglan - unless you think that Immarel's birth town is rightfully Strutmari land, then I think you ought to-"\n\n"Enough!" Immarel's curt command cut Talaran off immediately, as Ishera stepped back from her impending escalation, crossing her arms. Immarel knew that the Peitar had done winter a great service at Minnorac, and had seized Fasacglan and Imatt from the Tuathak invaders, not native Snecboth states. But their refusal to return the provinces, and their rejection of the supremacy of winter did pose a problem - who knew that these folk would not one day pose a threat to Winter's security?

 flavor_gemradcurt.9.d:0 "Immarel entered the underground chamber uneasily. Even now, she could hear the noise of construction above her head, as the workers erected the largest building Immarel had seen in her entire life, even in its unfinished state. Under her direction, they had built a monumental thing, with an even greater expanse of works underneath it. It was incredible, but as she walked within the tunnels and chambers of the Frostspear's subterranean levels, she wasn't entirely sure that the whole thing wouldn't come tumbling down on her head. She would have to get over her fear, however, for in this place lay the key to her destiny. In the centre of the chamber - which itself was large enough that the centrepiece seemed dwarfed by its surroundings, with a high ceiling and lots of space around the thing - there was a large, glowing-white crystal, mounted on some Precursor device, and punctured with many assorted tubes and cables, connected to the roof as if they were holding the crystal up. Before it stood the Everfrost Prince, looking deep into the Crystal's confines.\n\n§d"The Heart of Winter... and with the instruments of life gathered around you, this shall become the epicentre of your power."§! As Immarel approached him, the archfey did not move, though Immarel felt obligated to give him space. §d"When the long night comes, you shall bind your soul to the Heart, and eternal power will be yours..."§!\n\nThe words "eternal power" still affected Immarel in the same way it did when she first heard them. What the Everfrost Prince offered was eternal life - her soul would be bound to the Heart of Winter, her "phylactery", from which she would be able to control her own living body, or potentially that of somebody else, though that process was time-consuming, costly, and would effectively kill whomever it was done to. The Everfrost Prince had explained that this method, while being costlier and more dangerous, with the Heart having to remain within the Frostspear, would leave her stronger and with more vitality than traditional "eastern" methods of the same process, though Immarel did not know of what eastern land he spoke of. With her own wintry magic, she could freeze her mortal body and extend its vitality threefold, only needing to transfer to a new one once the old body was irreversible aged or damaged. This was a power fit to guide the Winter Court to a brighter new future - and with only a little more blood and sweat, it would be Immarel's to wield."

Immarel had done it - even now it seemed hardly believable to her - she had destroyed the realms of Autumn, and ended the centuries long conflict between Snecboth and Tuathak for good. §rShe had won.§!\n\nBut what now? That was the question that seemed to alight the city, even after its subjugation. Immarel came to the square at the city's heart, before the building that used to serve as Einsagg's centre of power. Her lieutenants were there, alongside a large part of the troops in the city. They were waiting for orders - all but one, of course. Captain Ishera moved forward, to pre-empt the words many expected from Immarel's mouth. She spoke of the innocents in the city, of the madness and senselessness of it all. Of the old way. Of the peaceful and moral and just life we used to live, before we were forced to take up arms against the invaders. Talaran and Serondar, hardliner captains both, attempted to shout over her, to accuse her and belittle her before the assembled troops, but Immarel stood them down with an ice-glare, and continued listening in silence.\n\nWhen Ishera had finished her appeal, seemingly all her energy spent on her own last stand, Immarel dismounted, and approached her. The square watched on in anticipation, Ishera in desperate hope. Immarel placed her hand on her old friend's shoulder. "Ishera...""

It reminded herself of an earlier time, before she had set her own nation alight, and brought every measure of destruction to the lands she called home. When she had sat by this very fire and contemplated a terrible nightmare... §rcalamity made manifest.§! Ruin written across the north in letters dripping red, staining the very snow red with blood. She saw, and she did not understand. She chose wrong. Or, at least, that was the thought that kept her up at night. That followed her in her most private moments. That chilled her to her core.\n\nBut there was something kept the faith in herself and her choice alive. She had won the struggle she brought on her nation, and now she was in an unprecedented position to mould it to her will, to throw every resource into ensuring this would never happen again. But those words still rang hollow - sitting in this room, by this fire, she remembered making the same vow, with a different antagonist. Something had to change. Immarel had to think differently. Safety, security - vital, yes, but had she really been treating them so? Or had those words just been a cover for the wrath and burning desire for vengeance that had consumed her since she saw her home taken from her by the Tuathak, since she had seen family and friend alike slaughtered like vermin for reasons alien to her to this day. §rThe wrath that had reduced half the nation to ash.§!\n\nImmarel took her hands away from the fire. It didn't matter really - she had lost most feeling in them long ago. She had remembered, soon after her ascension, resolving not to bother taking a new body until her old one had crumbled to dust or been destroyed. She didn't need to feel - she could exist apart from and above her own people. But that wasn't good enough - that attitude, that loss of feeling, had led her into committing the most terrible crimes. Immarel shook her head, and grabbed a quill and paper from her desk, and wrote an order calling for a young woman of her height and size to be brought to the Heart-Chamber. She would not rule as a cold skeleton, but as a flesh and blood elf, who ate and slept and adored the warmth of a fire just as her subjects did. She would still have to oppress her subjects, of course. Crush dissent, break rebellions, stifle freedoms and liberties - but no longer would she do so for as some cold tyrant, for her own wrath and rage and personal power, but for the prosperity of her people. So they may live in blissful harmony, under Gemradcurt's banner and Immarel's protection. She would rule not as a military commander would over the Snecboth, as a bringer of calamity.

The minister threw up his hands, setting aside his coat as he hurried over to the Great Leader's body. "Oh, this is calamity! Calamity!" He moved to kneel by her body, but the Deputy Commander of the Taigan Order stopped him before he could get his trousers wet in a puddle on the floor. The minister moved to her other side. "Oh... oh no! She's on the floor, the fucking floor! What to do, what to do? My heart is- it's sick! Like it's going into battle..." The minister turned to the Deputy Commander.

And our actual leader is lying on the floor in a- in a puddle of indignity! " The minister turned towards the Commander of the Eiganrac, who was slumped far too comfortably on Immarel's office chair. "Look, the way I see it, I really think Immarel's face is telling us we should get her a doctor, and now!"\n\nThe Commander cocked his head, looking the minister for agriculture up and down. "Are you wearing a night-gown?"\n\nThe minister was taken aback, indignant once more. "Why - yes, I am wearing a night-gown! And I'm wearing one because I act decisively and with great speed, Iwandir! Now, if neither of you are going to provide any worthwhile leadership, I really do think its time I-"\n\nThe Commander of the Eiganrac cut him off, standing up with a start.

Get out, or you'll be the next person in here lying in a puddle of their own piss. The Eiganrac are taking over."

 flavor_gemradcurt.32.t:0 "The Long Night - Reflections"
 flavor_gemradcurt.32.d:0 "Immarel sat slumped in her chair, one hand held to her head, and the other reaching out to the fire. She felt its warmth against her skin - savoured it. Would she feel the same thing tomorrow? Would this ritual strip her even of that? Immarel thought these things, but in her mind a different worry turned over and over again. Last night she had dreamed she had climbed to the tip of the Frostspear, a swirling maelstrom of snow and magic above her, and for miles and miles she beheld the destruction of the land. The buildings of Gemradcurt lie ruined, wood and stone husks were all that remained of the city's vitality. Snecboth bodies littered the streets - Riders ran roughshod through them, hunting down any elf still living. Outside the city, thousands or tens of thousands laid dead. §rDeath wrote its name in bloody characters across the snow.§!\n\nImmarel had awoken with tears in her eyes. Grief-stricken, though the events she had seen had not yet come to pass. She was blinded by her fear then, but now she could see two possibilities before her. In one, that grim day was the result of inaction. A future where she threw off this new power out of worry, and Gemradcurt was finally overrun by its enemies. By the realms of the south perhaps, or strange invaders from the sea. The other, that terrible alternative, was that what she was about to do would be the harbinger of catastrophe. That she would be the §dmother of death§!, and from her womb would spring calamity unrivalled by all others. That her hubris, her clamour for ever more power, would undo everything that had been won by the blood of hundreds of thousands of her countrymen.\n\nImmarel sat motionless on the chair, thinking and thinking and thinking. Her skin grew uncomfortably hot under the fire, but she didn't care - didn't retrieve it. She had the choice... The ritual was ready, and it would begin tomorrow night, but all she had to do was give the word and it would be cast aside, or she could go to sleep now, and go to her destiny. A coin flip that would decide the fate of her nation."

 flavor_gemradcurt.33.d:0 "After she had given the word, the instruments of life had been dismantled. The phylactery had been shattered. Immarel heard no more from the Everfrost Prince of grand plans or an eternal winter - but she bore no punishment either. She had not made any sort of official pact with him yet, and that fact had likely saved her life. Nevertheless, the close call with the fey has changed Immarel. While she still believes that Gemradcurt must rule unopposed in Eordand, she understands that the Winter Court cannot afford to throw away all the things they had once fought for - or else they may invite that terrible fate she had dreamt of on that long night. Her quest for personal power had nearly made her a slave of the fey, but no longer - if she wants to lead her people to glory, she must do so alone, under her own power. And, chance willing, Immarel and her successors would build an eternal Winter Court, not just an eternal winter."

 flavor_gemradcurt.34.t:0 "The Long Night - Crisis"
 flavor_gemradcurt.34.d:0 "Immarel awoke with a start. There was a clamour around her as soldiers and merchantmen and nobles rushed to barricade doors, sharpen their weapons, and plan their next move. Her wrists and ankles were bound, and someone had put a gag in her mouth. She was still wearing the white nightgown she wore to bed. She looked around. In the heart chamber, heavily armed, stood a large part of the cream of Gemradcurt's society. They had figured out her plan, were spooked, and staged a coup. Fantastic. Near one of the chamber doors stood Captain Serondar and a few very prominent nobles - they were arguing about what to do next. Judging by the mention of his name, the faint shouting and noise from the other side of the chamber doors, and the incessant thud of battering rams striking them, Captain Talaran was on the other side, trying to get in. At least someone had stayed loyal. It didn't matter, though - Talaran wasn't getting in, and she wasn't getting out. The binds were so tight they bit into her skin, and she could barely move her fingers - no casting spells.\n\nThen time stopped. An Archfey, the most beautiful elf Immarel had ever seen, clad in white furs and armour, apparated from thin air and approached, crouching down before her. §d"The Long Night has come. Now is the time that the wheat separates from the chaff, and those who are on the side of winter reveal themselves."§! Immarel's binds suddenly broke free, movement restored to her even as everyone else in the room stood dead-still. She pulled the gag from her mouth, and the Everfrost Prince continued. §d"I propose a pact, at this darkest hour. I grant you power - eternal life, and magical abilities beyond compare. And in return, you shall cast the land into an eternal winter, so that the snow shall fall for half the year, and so that all may feel the icy embrace of winter."§! He offered his hand. §d"And what say you, my champion, my faithful servant?"§!\n\nImmarel took it without delay."
 flavor_gemradcurt.34.a:0 "§D"And Your wish is my command..."§!"
 
 flavor_gemradcurt.35.t:0 "The Long Night - Ascension"
 flavor_gemradcurt.35.d:0 "Captain Talaran nearly cried out in anguish when he heard a great explosion consume the Heart-Chamber from the other side of the doors. For a few minutes, he feared - thought - Immarel dead, his dear leader, with whom he was half in love, slain by perfidious traitors. Then the doors opened, and he feared no longer. Immarel stood within the chamber, the inside of the phylactery behind her swirling with magical energy, wisps of it filling the chamber and spreading out once the doors opened. She stood tall, nearly majestic in her power, and completely at ease, despite her injuries, standing in the biting cold in nothing but a dirty nightgown - all the plotters and traitors were dead on the floor, reduced to frozen corpses. With a flick of her hand, they rose once again in service to her. The Taigan Order loyalists, Talaran included, knelt in submission to her - but they had no idea what had truly transpired. What Immarel had become. What would soon happen to Gemradcurt.\n\nAlong with the rest of the nation, they soon would. From the tip of the Frostspear, coinciding with the explosion within its depths, erupted a beam of light that seemed to pierce the sky, a maelstrom of ice and wind and magic erupting over the skies of the city. Across northern Eordand, from Slecgal to Marathmas to Einsagg, the days kept growing colder and colder and colder, until the entire nation was plunged into a deep winter. Snow fell. Then armies marched from the Frostspear - armies of undead, of frozen corpses and ice-white skeletons, led by Taigan Order officers. And, finally, Immarel told the people what had occurred.\n\nThere had been a grave threat to Gemradcurt - a coup attempt from within, supported by enemies from without. Immarel was forced to take drastic measures. This new winter, a near-eternal winter that would last 9 months of the year, alongside the undead armies streaming out of Gemradcurt, would protect them forever - as would Immarel. For Immarel had seized the power of eternal life. She urged for calm. For people to remain in their homes until the threat had passed."

 # Red Winter \n\n
 
 flavor_gemradcurt.101.t:0 "The Red Winter"
 flavor_gemradcurt.101.d:0 "The coup attempt during what is now known as "The Long Night" involved a cross-section of Gemradcurt's society. Hastily thrown together over the course of a week, it was comprised of notable nobles, merchantmen, clergy, and even Taigan Order soldiers, be they followers of Ishera (who did not know of the attempt) or previously devout supporters of Immarel such as the late Captain Serondar. And so, the deaths of those conspirators naturally raised the anger of much of Gemradcurt's establishment. A confrontation - unrest - was likely. But Immarel had not expected this.\n\nIt began as demonstrations. Disobedience. It soon turned into small scale raids, ambushes on Taigan Order soldiers and undead patrols. §rThen everything collapsed, all at once.§! Entire provinces began to openly reject Immarel's rule. Armouries were looted, and the majority of regular Snecboth soldiers deserted or mutinied. A great part of the people of Gemradcurt had risen up in fear and anger at Immarel's seizure of power, and her use of necromancy, long thought a distasteful but necessary weapon of war, had been unmasked for what they now saw it to truly be - an evil art, designed only to increase Immarel's personal power, and unleash unrivalled tyranny on the Snecboth people.\n\nBut Immarel was not alone - the greater part of the Taigan Order remained fanatically loyal. Many clergy, merchants and nobles chose to support her either out of fear or simply to hedge their bets on the side they thought would win. And, despite many ordinary peoples shock and anger, perhaps four-tenths of the Snecboth population could not separate Immarel the liberator, the victorious conqueror and defender, from whatever they said she was now. The revelation that the §dEverfrost Prince§!, an Archfey of legend, had been helping Immarel gave even more legitimacy to her cause. By the end of the month, the hoped-for mass overthrow of Immarel had not materialised - instead, the lines of a true civil war, family against family and friend against friend, had been drawn. §rThe Red Winter had begun."

 flavor_gemradcurt.102.t:0 "Watchers of the White"
 flavor_gemradcurt.102.d:0 "Captain Ishera Fasacminn and Immarel Winterswrath had been close. The year before Immarel had been propelled to leadership by Gemradcurt's militarists, Ishera had joined the Taigan Order, the same age as Immarel, and the two had become fast friends. Though she did not have the years or experience of some of her older advisors, Immarel trusted none more than Ishera when it came to good, sound counsel. They knew each other well, and they had fought side by side on many occasions. When it came to personal matters, not matters of state or warfare or whatever else concerned government, Ishera was the only person whom Immarel could turn to. But one of them had changed. Either Ishera grew too soft, or Immarel grew too wrathful, too hungry for power and security and eternal peace. By the time the Long Night came, there was this rift between them, indistinct but ever-present. In the days after her ascension, Immarel had hoped, foolishly, that Ishera might understand what she had done. Might play the friend and confidant in the undoubtedly tough time ahead.\n\nBut she was wrong. Of course she was - it was folly to hope for any other outcome. Soon after the Red Winter began in earnest, Ishera publicly and ostentatiously defected to the rebels. She denounced Immarel as a traitor to the people of Gemradcurt, to the old ways and to the Winter Court. Quickly, she emerged as a key figure in the resistance, and soon enough, she had been appointed as the leader of a force that would strike down her old comrade. They call themselves "The Watchers of the White", claiming to represent the true, legitimate government of Gemradcurt, and are comprised largely of the nation's prominent rebellious nobility and mercantile class, many of whom had lost friends and family in the chaos of the Long Night. They are well equipped, highly motivated, and worse still well-led. If Immarel is to retain control of Gemradcurt, the Watchers must be taken care of without delay."

 flavor_gemradcurt.103.d:0 "The main army of the Watchers of the White has been crushed. Ishera's body, brought to Immarel by a loyalist Taigan Order soldier, mercifully and fortunately unraised, was buried with full honours by her old friend, but the legacy of her betrayal, and those of the many other nobles and merchants who followed her into battle, remains. With their primary field army destroyed and many of their members settling into localised guerrilla warfare, the time has come to see that in the post-war Gemradcurt these traitors do not rear their heads once again - the families of the rebels will have their property confiscated and their assets seized, so that they will not dare to rise up against Gemradcurt again."

 flavor_gemradcurt.104.t:0 "The Tuathak Rebellion"
 flavor_gemradcurt.104.d:0 "When Einsagg was razed, and the realms of Autumn brought under the control of Immarel, it was believed that the threat to winter posed by the Tuathak was permanently ended - but, as the Snecboth settlers, administrators and soldiers in Glorethir have now found out, this was not the case. All across the Tuathak-majority territories in the west, Autumn Court fanatics and Tuathak separatists have risen in revolt, slaughtering any Snecboth they can find and reimposing the worship of Autumn through their controlled territories. While most of these revolts are localised, in Raithtall a far more serious threat has arisen.\n\nIt seems that after the defeat of Raithtall by Immarel and Gemradcurt, the son of its last ruler, one Galhan Oakgardner, fled to the Golden Acres of Dorcurt, alongside a large population of loyalists. Dispersing into the local population, who were supportive of Galhan and his men in the face of Snecboth tyranny, they hid there for many years, waiting for the perfect moment to strike and reclaim their home - and that time is now. Already Raithtall has fallen to their new Oakgardner king, and it seems the western situation is on a precipice. If we are to prevent another Hibernal Crusade from occuring, we must deal with these traitors as quickly as possible."

 flavor_gemradcurt.105.d:0 "With the Tuathak rebellion put down, and the last Oakgardner slain before the walls of his city, the fate of our old enemy now lies completely within our hands. The events of the rebellion have shown many that the Tuathak are ungovernable - that their culture and way of life is antithetical to the rule of winter, and that we must change their ways through whatever means necessary in order to prevent another rebellion. However, with Immarel's grip on Gemradcurt slowly tightening, there is another suggestion - with her personal power growing by the day, and the mechanisms of repression likewise growing in strength, would it not be possible to force the Tuathak to submit without diverting immense resources to their destruction? Whatever the choice, it will likely guide our future interactions with similarly unruly peoples. Immarel must choose wisely."

 flavor_gemradcurt.106.d:0 "The Northern Dukads had always chafed under the rule of Gemradcurt. The people were wary of the high taxes necessary for funding Immarel's wars, and they resented placing their kin under the command of distant and fanatical Taigan Order commanders. After the Feast at Daidh, and the integration of both Dukads into Gemradcurt proper, this resentment grew and grew. And now, finally, Immarel's takeover has seemingly been the pebble that cracked the ice. The dispossessed former royal families of Gelcolle and Reotcrab have each risen in revolt, raising sizable forces in defiance of Immarel's will. If we are to maintain the unity of the Snecboth people, these traitors must be crushed."

 flavor_gemradcurt.107.t:0 "The White Terror"
 flavor_gemradcurt.107.d:0 "The "Northern Betrayal" of the traitor-dukads of Gelcolle and Reotcrab has shown Immarel the true extent to which rebellious forces have infiltrated the nation. Across the northern provinces, people of all stripes and backgrounds rose up in support of figures who, trully, had not been politically relevant since their realms had been subsumed into Gemradcurt all those years ago. The strength of anti-Immarel feeling was great indeed, and that strength required an equally strong response. While Taigan Order soldiers have everywhere rose to the task of weeding out traitors in the many towns and villages of the north, it was in fact a different force who have proved best.\n\nComprised of ordinary Snecboth, who have joined Immarel's side in the Red Winter out of duty or loyalty or whatever else motivates them, these mounted warriors, who call themselves the Eiganrac, and bare an insignia of a white snowflake on a bloody field, have proved their worth countless times, reducing many regions of the country to submission through sheer, efficient brutality. Towns have been razed and rebels-under-arms and those who support them alike executed without delay. They have been at the forefront of what the enemy call "the White Terror", a campaign of "police actions" that, yes, have resulted in the deaths of many civilians, but have also been vital in securing the regime's survival.\n\nIf we are to see the end of this civil war, this force must be organised and subsumed under the direct control of the Taigan Order, so that we may employ them in even greater strength and numbers, and quickly reduce this realm to order."

 flavor_gemradcurt.108.d:0 "As one by one rebellious factions were dispersed or destroyed, many thought that this bloody phase of the Red Winter was finally drawing to a close, and that soon enough Immarel would rule uncontested over Eordand's north. With the news that Jahainar Truespear has recently emerged from the Domandrod with a force of thousands of Strutmari and Tuathak refugees and emigres, Gladewardens, and disparate groups of Snecboth rebels, all of those hopes (and fears) have been shattered.\n\nA powerful mage from Trimgarb, Truespear appears to have been granted passage through the Domandrod in a similar fashion to that army of Iadth that once crushed the Autumnal realm of Dorcurt, his army emerging from the Winter Gate at Dungat and headed straight for the city of Gemradcurt - it is clear that if Immarel does not deal with this new threat with haste, all she has worked for may unravel before her."

Many within the resistance hoped that it would be the final blow that would topple the rule of the hated necromancer-queen, and that the civil war that had torn apart their home would end in their favour. But as Truespear was slain and his army was shattered on the approach to Gemradcurt, those hopes melted away. Now, it seems only a matter of time before Immarel achieves her final victory.\n\nBut for the regime, the destruction of Truespear's army nonetheless presents an interesting question.\n\nThough Tuathak and Snecboth rebels also contributed to his force, the majority of his followers were Peitar, be they Strutmari refugees who had fled to the Domandrod or other Peitar states, adventurers from Pelomar or Trimgarb, or Gladewardens donated to the effort by the Fey, abandoning their usual posts in an extraordinary effort to destroy the most existential threat to balance ever seen in the region. While many in the regime wish for the Peitar to be punished for their transgressions, there are still those who argue that there is no need to waste resources persecuting a people who could be more easily brought to heel by other methods - no matter the answer, it will undoubtedly set a precedent for how we handle the peitar in the future. The choice, like everything else in the north, is now in Immarel's hands."

Many push aside their doubts, and redouble their efforts in ending the civil war. In the case of our recently departed advisor, the opposite occurs. Taking with them a significant amount of state resources, they have turned traitor and joined with those wishing to depose Immarel."

While the normal process of rooting out entrenched guerrillas or striking out at Immarellian garrisons is responsible for much of this devastation, it is undeniable that the methods of the "Eiganrac", fanatic human volunteers who have taken Immarel's side during the civil war, have been instrumental in reducing much of the nation to both tranquil ashes, charred and frostbitten corpses staining the snow red.

The Red Winter has proven this many times over. From the day wights and undead soldiers began to stream out of the Frostspear, they and their Order-Knight puppetmasters have come under relentless attack from rebel fighters - while primarily this has been a costly but drawn-out process of attrition, ever so often the guerrillas achieve an astounding victory - unfortunately, this has recently been the case, as a Taigan Order force was destroyed to a man by a surgical attack by an irregular rebel militia. With their wights and skeletal soldiers collapsing to dust or going beserk without their masters, the entire army is lost to us, and it will likely be costly to replace them."

Instead of a quick victory, the devastating civil war that tore apart Gemradcurt for years ended not with a bang, but with a whimper. As the months passed, rebel strongholds were broken, tax revenues increased, disobedience of agents of the state and Taigan Order-Knights alike declined, and the massive amounts of undead soldiers raised for the defence of the regime began to be penned off or disposed of, no longer necessary for the new Gemradcurt, where Immarel finally reigns absolutely supreme. Finally, mercifully, the Red Winter is over."
