 gemradcurt_dead_trial_at_darblath_desc:0 "The news of Eighard's great disaster at Minnorac was good to be sure, but despite the death of their ruler, Andrall Harvestcrown, their city stood tall, and they have been recovering their strength ever since. But the Icewarded-Walls of Darblath are not unbreakable - with the Winter united, it is time for Gemradcurt to lead the charge in destroying one of its most perfidious foes.\n\nAnd, of course, Immarel has her own mission. As her power grows, spurred on by the Everfrost Prince, she has gained access to even greater arcane power - especially in the forbidden field of necromancy. While she used some of this during her initial counter-attack against the Autumn, she has yet to trial these powers on a large scale - and the devastated remains of Darblath seem just the place."

 gemradcurt_the_taigan_supremacy_desc:0 "Immarel Winterswrath has enjoyed a close and intimate relationship with the Taigan Order, which was previously only responsible for the arcane education of young women within Gemradcurt's borders. After she rose to power, however, nobody had expected the extent to which she would empower and expand the role of her order. Membership was expanded to include men, and the Order gradually consumed more and more responsibilities within the country. However, this process is not yet complete - in order for Immarel and Gemradcurt to protect the nation and the Winter, the Taigan Order must reign supreme over the country, so that her authority and power may be absolute."

Immarel has recieved plans from her fey patron, and has already set her resources to the task of creating a device to bring about a change in the power balance of Eordand forever, a machine that will secure the Winter's survival.\n\nTo this end, she has begun the construction of the Frostspear, a massive tower of twisting metal and ice that shall be seen by all for miles around - and underneath that tower, work has begun on a chamber that shall contain the very heart of winter..."

 gemradcurt_unite_the_winter_desc:0 "When the hated Autumn first began their forays into our lands, the Winter Court stood disunited, seemingly oblivious to the mortal peril they were in. Even as the realms of the east fell, and the Tuathak despoiled our native lands, the nations of the north fought alone, too proud to see that united they would stand a far better chance. It cost us dearly.\n\nAnd yet even now, with the Autumn's unity shattered at Minnorac, many within our sister-realms of Gelcolle and Reotcrab have seemingly put down their arms, and refused to take the steps necessary to protect our way of life - and to make matters worse, there are even whispers that Gelcolle would dare to consort with the enemy in Raithtall. To Immarel, this disturbing news has shown to her clearly what is to be done - if the Winter is to be saved, the Winter must be united. And if that must be brought about by force, so be it."

Despite this, however, there still remains a sizeable minority of both autumn worshipers and Tuathak folk themselves - if these lands are to truly be restored to their former beauty, these invaders must be expelled."

But still, our job is not finished. If we are to avoid another catastrophe like this again, we must marshal our resources once more, and strike deep into the heart of Autumn! With whatever means necessary, the future and destiny of our people and faith will be won - and the Everfrost Crusade will see it so."

 gemradcurt_the_long_night_desc:0 "The Winter lies victorious over the hated Tuathak, and even now our soldiers scour the remains of our defeated foe, purging those who would stand against us and turning as many people as possible towards the light of our faith.\n\nBut still, there exists grave threats to our future prosperity - there have been concerning murmers from the east of a "dragon god", and even now those in the south rally against us, and sharpen their blades in anticipation of an attack. And not to mention the threat from within our borders - disregarding the Tuathak remnants, there have been concerns raised about our own people, who chafe under our rule, some openly criticising our new, aggressive Winter Court.\n\nBut the Everfrost Prince has given Immarel a solution to this - personal powers unimaginable, so that she may secure the survival of Winter forever, and so that the Snecboth will never again see the devastation of the Hibernal Crusade. And with the instruments of life gathered around her, and the resources of the North under her control, the previously insane requirements of this ritual of his have become more achievable by the day. If Immarel is to secure the future of winter forever, perhaps this most drastic step must be taken?"

She had declined, feigning tiredness, but in reality she was simply shocked. The decades long struggle against the hated Autumn had been ended by Peitar hands, not by that of the Snecboth.\n\nFor a time Immarel was thankful, but as the Strutmari's grip on the Snecboth lands of Imatt and Fasacglan tightened, her mood soured. Now, the path forward has become clear to her - winter alone must secure its future, not rely on the charity of those who would otherwise seek to shackle it. The lands under Strutmar's control must be retaken by force - after that, who can say what will happen to its Peitar occupiers?"

For too long, the tenets of the Winter Court have been weak passivity and defensiveness. Patience and inactivity that nearly fatally weakened us when we faced our most bitter struggle against the Autumn. Over the years, the people of Winter have begun to break out of that mindset, with Immarel leading the charge in Gemradcurt, but the time has come to spread this new worship of winter across our realm, so that we may never again face a disaster like the Hibernal crusade."

The Everfrost Crusade, Winter's righteous campaign into the heart of Autumn, has been wildly successful, and now Immarel stands on a defeated and broken people, chased to their last bastion at Einnsag, who had proclaimed themselves the successors of Eighard's legacy as the leaders of the Autumn Court.

While there is no doubt that they must be convinced of the supremacy and brilliance of winter, there remains the question of how best to deal with these cultures in the south - thankfully, in our dealings with the Tuathak and northern Peitar, we have already shaped the path we will take - no matter what, all of Eordand will be united under Immarel's new "Everfrost Court.""

Not only did Jahainar Truespear's expeditionary force assault her from the forest, and not only has the Domandrod proved to be an incredible tool for the Eordand Fey to strike down those it views as too dangerous (as seen as Minnorac or Dorcurt) the forest represents the last and most powerful remnant of an Eordand that was, where the winter did not reign supreme. This cannot last.\n\nImmarel has, with the aid of the Order of Arcane Sciences and the gifts of the Everfrost Prince, finally gathered the resources she needs in order to break down the walls and wards of the Domandrod, and seize the groves for herself. The population of the Old Forest has swelled from the many, many refugees that have streamed into it during and after Immarel's conquest of Eordand, and they will surely sally out to face us, and harass us once we enter the forest, but that is no matter - Gemradcurt and the Everfrost Court shall claim what is rightfull hers!"

The Peitar have had great success by retreating deep into the forest and harassing our forces in lightning raids. Every day, men and materiel are lost, as the terrain has proved a great obstacle to our undead soldiers, and our living ones dread being assigned to a place they see as a death trap. But this cannot last - despite the obstacles, our settlements in the forest push ever inwards, and it is only a matter of time before we secure our rule in the Domandrod for good. By constructing fortifications throughout the forest, and pacifying the population, Immarel shall be at last the new mistress of the Domandrod."

The Domandrod has long been thought to be rich in resources, selfishly hoarded by the fey and their peitar favourites, and the Order of Arcane Sciences's surveys in the region have only confirmed our suspicions. By constructing a series of plantations within the forest, where petty and political prisoners alike shall labour under the canopy in order to extract the forest's resources, we shall greatly enrich ourselves."

Under her direction, the boffins at the Order of Arcane Sciences have completed their first trials on infusing elven bones with metal through a complex transmutation spell, though only Immarel has the power and skill to attempt to refine the spell so that it works on its desired target - an undead skeletal soldier.\n\nThough the field of transmutation is shunned by the Everfrost Prince, the idea of legions of steel soldiers marching in lock-step through the streets of Gemradcurt has captivated Immarel's mind, and she has been awaiting its upcoming trial with giddy anticipation - her new "Rite of Steel and Bone" will allow her to fulfil that dream, and if it requires some transmutation magic to do so, what's the harm?"

 gemradcurt__original_purpose_restored_desc:0 "When Immarel was admitted into the Taigan Order, it was of minor stature compared to the Moraine and Tarn orders, only being responsible for the arcane education of young women. When the Lady Mother took power, and she had first expanded the Order's power by allowing the admission of young men with arcane potential as well, nobody had expected that it would be the first act in the Order's meteoric rise to power. By the end of the Everfrost Crusade, the Order controlled nearly all functions of the Gemradcurter state.\n\nBut this great expansion in the Order's remit and duties came at a cost - it's original purpose of arcane education was sidelined as order manpower was increasingly drawn to other projects. If Gemradcurt is to maintain a large base of skilled mages with which to uphold its magical requirements and duties, then it must turn the Taigan Order back towards it's old purpose. To that end, an Arcane Academy shall be established in the archives of Arakeprun."

 gemradcurt_shelter_from_the_storm_title:0 "Shelter form the Storm"
 gemradcurt_shelter_from_the_storm_desc:0 "When the second and third years of the civil war passed with barely two weeks of summer, the reports from the capital of a swirling maelstrom of magical power in the clouds above the Frostspear grew ever more worrying for those who challenged Immarel's rule. After the end of the Red Winter, the words of Immarel put all doubt to rest - the winter was her doing. Across Gemradcurt, only for a few months of the year did the temperature rise high enough for agriculture to be sustained, and for much of the rest, the world fell under darkness.\n\nThe worst effects of the winter were countered only by careful preparation. Fortifications were constructed to store grain, warmed by magic, and houses were reinforced against the Everfrost. In many places, the Red Winter had "corrected" the population in favour of the new situation. But if Gemradcurt is to remain prosperous, this is no good solution - we must devise a way for the greater population to be protected from the icy grip of winter. And, thankfully, bright minds have just the solution: the "Hearthwards", a series of complex enchantments and spells designed to protect an area from the glacial onslaught of cold, and allow for sustained farming throughout the year - a state-provided shelter from the storm."

Already, members of the educational staff at Arakeprun have been working on less expensive (though less powerful) Hearthwards, that may be constructed much more easily than their greater counterparts. They have seen great success, and have petitioned the Lady Mother for increased funds for the project.\n\nIn response, Immarel has gone even further than their original request. Seeing the usefulness of their endeavours, she has ordered the formation of a new "Order of Arcane Sciences", headquartered in Arakeprun but with branches in Gemradcurt and Murdkather. Combined with the increasing development of the sources of Precursor Relics so prominent in the region, the OAS will have ample resources to enhance and advance our technological abilities, including their lesser Hearthwards project that may prove to revolutionise Gemradcurt's economic situation..."

Now, they have come to Immarel again with another brilliant new idea - with extensive application of both lesser and greater hearthwards, and the necessary infrastructure and population within a city to support them, they believe that they can create a "Hearth-City", havens in the winter from which extensive urban populations can thrive, so long as they are supported by the rest of the population. If seen through, this project might be able to give Gemradcurt the edge it needs to compete with the more populous and prosperous nations of the world."

But as Immarel's power has grown, the Frostspear's facilities have become inadequate for the administration of such a large realm. Therefore, Immarel, with the aid of the premier architects of the OAS, has devised plans for a new building that will form the centre of her realm - the Lady Mother's Tower.\n\nAn imposing structure, likely the tallest in North Aelantir and perhaps the world, the Lady Mother's Tower will be a pyramid-shaped shard of ice, metal and glass, towering into the skies and casting a heavy shadow over the streets of Gemradcurt. Reinforced and protected by Immarel's magic, every floor will have ample space for government and Order civil servants to work in, the building's floor layout inspired by the halfing "house-stacking" methods learnt from Cannorian traders. In addition to this, an extensive underground network of every arcane and industrial facility imaginable will be built below the tower, so that Gemradcurt will once again be the beating heart of the nation's undead military. From her office at the very highest floors of the building, the lady in the high tower will have her entire realm at her fingertips."

We know that is not the case - our eastwards expansion is merely defensive in nature, and we have no need to threaten the human colonists to our south. Therefore, in order to secure our place on the continent, and protect our nation from the potential reprisals of our ignorant and frightened neighbours, we must take it upon ourselves to educate the Cannorians of Aelantir that we are, above all else, a respectable power."

While the Eiganrac's pre-existing military division, the Eiganrac Riders, has proven sufficient until now, we cannot ignore the increasing demands on us - and luckily we have the perfect candidate to achieve this end.\n\nThe "Everwinter Brigade" of the Eiganrac Order's military wing have proven their worth time and time again on the Expanse, repeatedly routing and defeating Epednar raids decisively and with great speed. Nicknamed "the Everwinter Knights" for their tenacity and noble spirit, that resembles the Ynnic cavalry we have fought time and time again near the great river, we shall expand this group into a new division of "Everwinter Riders", so that they may be another sword-arm of Immarel's will."

 gemradcurt_armour_of_winter_desc:0 "The Eiganrac, formed during the chaos and destruction of the Red Winter, has quickly risen to become the armour of winter, a precious resource for Immarel's efforts to maintain control over Gemradcurt, so that a catastrophe like the Red Winter can never happen again. However, on top of the order's issues with underfunding, their position under the control of the Taigan Order has reduced their efficiency, as both an extended chain of command and the Taigan Order's expansive mandate has made their operations slow and unwieldy.\n\nIn order to fix these issues, Alwaron Ferwylt, a prominent figure in the Eiganrac nicknamed the "Jester" for his previous occupation, devious mind, and impressive command over illusion magic, has presented a series of proposals for expanding and enhancing the organisation. By forming an entirely new "Eiganrac Order", whose Esbagg answers directly to Immarel, increasing the funding given to the new order and enhancing and expanding the Eiganrac's purview and powers, he hopes that they will prove an essential asset to the security of the realm - perhaps Immarel should take the young man up on his suggestions?"

By sending them to the Reokests, where they may work off their sins and sentence, and be transformed into upstanding citizens of Gemradcurt, these prisoners may be rehabilitated and sent back to their families!\n\nAnd besides, were they to fall, or succumb to the not-so-stellar conditions of these camps, there are ample Eiganrac officers nearby ready and willing to resurrect their corpse as compensation.

But they are, as Drozmagog seemingly discovered centuries ago, only mortals, and insignificant compared to the power of Immarel.\n\nNonetheless, to our cities and our soldiers Varlengeilt's dragon fire has proved a credible threat, and therefore the Lady Mother must move against him, or else Gemradcurt may find its glacial fortifications weeping under the heat of flame. By cornering him and his followers inside his temple at Svemel, we shall force a confrontation that history shall not forget."

 gemradcurt_pacifying_the_east_title:0 "Pacifying the East"
 gemradcurt_pacifying_the_east_desc:0 "The escape of Varlengeilt and the great destruction visited upon the city of Svemel has incensed the Rzentur. Believing that their god is preparing for a grand return that will sweep away the Snecboth invaders, across the region dragon cultists have been rising up against Gemradcurt's rule, and have already done great damage to our garrisons there.\n\nIf we were to face invasion in the region from another foe, it is likely that we will run into difficulty maintaining our positions, and so we must act and act quickly. The Taigan and Eiganrac Orders stand ready to root out and destroy those dissidents within our borders - with their powers and the strength of our faith, this problem will be confronted head on."

 gemradcurt_birthplace_of_two_empires_title:0 "Birthplace of Two Empires"
 gemradcurt_birthplace_of_two_empires_desc:0 "Ever since we seized Rzenta, the knights of Dolindha have regarded us with suspicion and hostility - when reports emerged of errant knights striking out against our border towns, it confirmed Immarel's prior feelings - Dolindha must be conquered for Gemradcurt's borders to be secured.\n\nHowever, in order to avoid another crisis like in Rzenta, we first must make a display of force that will ensure the region recognises us as the credible and powerful actor that we are - the Lady Mother has set her sights on Vareynn, the birthplace of the Ynnic Empire, as the birthplace of the next great empire of the Ynn - Gemradcurt."

 gemradcurt_the_depths_of_dalaire_title:0 "The Depths of Dalaire"
 gemradcurt_the_depths_of_dalaire_desc:0 "The Precursors left many incredible relics throughout Aelantir, and though Eordand's reserves are vast, there are still untapped treasure troves of these relics throughout the north, such as in the desolate Dalairey Wastes. Though incredibly difficult to traverse, we Snecboth are acclimatised to the extreme cold, and hopefully, with enough resources and funding, we might be able to pull even a small fraction of the riches buried in the depths of Dalaire."

 gemradcurt_the_cutting_edge_title:0 "The Cutting Edge"
 gemradcurt_the_cutting_edge_desc:0 "With the advance of technology, the Order of Arcane Sciences have transitioned to the study and advancement of artificery with the utmost vigour and determination, a development which has come at no surprise for anyone who have had to deal with the "boffins" over at the OAS.\n\nDespite their eccentricities, however, they have once gain proved their invaluable worth in this field, pioneering a truly unique Gemradcurter style of artificery - and with the riches of Eordand and North Aelantir at our fingertips, it seems that it is only a matter of time before we become the cutting edge of science and technology. With this in mind, it is time that we grant the Order of Arcane Sciences full control over the states artifice-endeavours."

 gemradcurt_business_as_usual_title:0 "Business as Usual"
 gemradcurt_business_as_usual_desc:0 "To say that Cannor is rich beyond imagining would be an understatement - its traders live in as much opulence as their kings and queens do, and their cities stand tall and grand amidst their fertile lands. Therefore, it is natural that Gemradcurt must be able to trade with the nations of Cannor, so that it may further its own prosperity.\n\nUnfortunately, there are many who still see Gemradcurt as an evil empire, intent on world domination or other such delusions. This is, of course, nonsense, but it seems we must show the world so - by protecting and patrolling the passage from North Aelantir to Cannor, and establishing diplomatic missions to the premier nations of Cannor, we shall establish ourselves as their equal, both morally and economically."

 gemradcurt_long_march_east_title:0 "Long March East"
 gemradcurt_long_march_east_desc:0 "To the east of Gemradcurt lies Armonadh, home to various minor tribes of Snecboth, who live contently in the hills and valleys of the area - but beyond that, past the Clatharloch and the hills of Gemradtíog, lies a civilisation nearly as ancient as ours, hugging a great river, and ruled by a dragon god of unknown power. These rumours and whispers, recently confirmed by Snecboth scouts, have greatly worried Immarel - if the Winter is to be protected, we must be embark on a long march east, in order to claim the resources of those frontiers for ourselves, and deal with any threats to Gemradcurt that may exist beyond the mountains."

 gemradcurt_end_the_ironhunger_title:0 "End the Ironhunger"
 gemradcurt_end_the_ironhunger_desc:0 "The "Ironhunger" has afflicted Eordand since we first left the Domandrod - outside that old forest there are almost no sources of iron, which itself is hoarded by the fey, who only give it our to their close allies, the Peitar. However, the discovery of iron - and an incredible amount of iron at that - in the Armonadh area has given Eordand its greatest opportunity to break out of this oppressive economic situation. We shall pour as many resources as we can into unearthing and developing the region, so that finally iron and steel may be made available to all in Eordand who want it."

 gemradcurt_into_the_unknown_title:0 "Into the Unknown"
 gemradcurt_into_the_unknown_desc:0 "With the Ironhunger ended and Armonadh developed, the road into Rzenta and the Ynn has been opened to us, a process that has also allowed us to gain a much greater understanding of the region, which, above all else, has shown us the necessity of advancing in force into the region, so that we may end the Draconic threat once and for all.\n\nBy first securing the forests of Mrazhelai and Velildeven, we shall gain the foothold over the mountains that are needed for further military operations."

 gemradcurt_frostbringer_title:0 "Frostbringer"
 gemradcurt_frostbringer_desc:0 "The Broken Sea is a realm of pure, unrestrained winter - for much of the year, the sea is covered in fields of ice, so pure you need to cover your eyes lest you be blinded by the reflection of the sun. But Gemradcurt's expansion into the region is not only for nostalgic purposes, for the Broken Sea also holds the closest coveted sea route between Cannor and the northern Ynn and Eordand, the Northwest Passage. As evidenced by the passage of the Istralorian Crusaders and the Themarians, this passage can surely be used to assault us from the north, and so it must be secured.\n\nBesides these two other factors, the third is one more personal to Immarel - the Everfrost Prince has called on her to claim the region, so that, in his words "a treasure of the past may reveal itself." What this means is not unknown to her, but regardless Immarel is ever-willing to carry out her patron's wishes."

 gemradcurt_cursed_labour_title:0 "Cursed Labour"
 gemradcurt_cursed_labour_desc:0 "The forest to the east of Dolindha is rich in natural resources, be that iron, lumber, fur or whatever else is hidden beneath the trees. It also just so happens to be, as its name suggests, full of "Cursed Ones", fiendishly strong purple-skinned elves, who shall make excellent labour in any camps we set up in the region. With this in mind, and the fierce aggressiveness and hostility the Cursed Ones have shown, it seems a perfect opportunity to catch two fish with one spear thrust - the rebellious cursed ones in the region shall be pacified, captured, and sent to work in an extensive camp system along the river."

 gemradcurt_mountains_of_gold_title:0 "Mountains of Gold"
 gemradcurt_mountains_of_gold_desc:0 "Northern Dalaire is, much like the forest to its west, rich in natural resources of all kinds. However, far and away the most profitable resource in the western reach is gold, which exists in great quantities in the Tiera mountains. With our trade with the Cannorians expanding, and the demands for silver and gold with which to trade with them increasing, these vast reserves shall be extremely useful in reinforcing our economic position - and, even better, the harsh terrain seems perfectly suited for another extensive Reokest network in the east."

 gemradcurt_winters_wooden_wall_title:0 "Winter's Wooden Wall"
 gemradcurt_winters_wooden_wall_desc:0 "The Cannorians have a long and proud maritime tradition, rivalled in Aelantir only by peoples such as the Caamasi and Kheionai. However, owing to some of our own traditions patrolling the Eigras Gate, and that of the long assimilated Reotcrab, who were dread-raiders on the ocean, the Snecboth are not wholly unfamiliar to the ways of sail.\n\nWith Cannorian trade increasing evermore with our conquest of Dalaire, the need for a stable and safe trading route to the eastern states grows alongside it, combined with the threat posed by naval attack, Gemradcurt must construct a fleet to rival the other powers of Cannor and Aelantir, so that we may both protect ourselves from attack from the sea and increase our dominance over the northern waters of Aelantir. And, to that end, we shall construct a grand home for said fleet, the Reotcal, or "frozen harbour", from which our power may be projected across the waves."
