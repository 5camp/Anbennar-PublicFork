 YRW_REFORM_TOOLTIP:0 "Are you sure you want to progress the current debate? Doing so could lead to revolts against our authority."

 debate_1_topic_tt:0 "When the Ending Flood washed over the world, it was believed that the elves along the River were the chosen survivors to claim the aftermath. However, some wonder if it is only those elves who live along the main river who are chosen or also those along the smaller tributaries."
 debate_2_topic_tt:0 "The Ynnic Empire was the strongest and longest lasting realm to exist within the Ynn Valley. Even so, it fell and ever since debates have raged over the true cause. Some say it was because the military power emperors had would break the army into civil war upon their deaths. Others claim that it fell due to decadent aristocrats who fought more among themselves than against the empire's enemies."
 debate_3_topic_tt:0 "The arrival of the Cannorians has brought new and strange weapons to the battlefield. While a rifle lacks the grace of a bow, many have begun to stockpile this new device. The question now presents to us whether we should adopt these cannorian guns for our own armies or if we should rely on the tactics that have served our people for centuries."
 debate_4_topic_tt:0 "It was recently believed that the Ynn River Valley was the fullest extent of the world and beyond the southern cliffs lay the Netherworld. However, these Cannorians have brought charts and maps from below the cliffs and much more. This has shaken the foundation of Ynn River Worship with clerics and commonfolk alike arguing over how these revelations should be interpreted."

 YnnDebate10Bloc0_2:0 "After months of anticipation and preparation, the guests have arrived - noble Ynnic knights, wealthy traders, and beautiful ladies fill the streets and sporting grounds of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Among this dazzling crowd, one could almost miss the rune-painted faces of Veykodan magicians and the lively robes sported by Epednar braves, as they haggle and laugh with Rzentur emissaries and Dolindhan squires, all thronging to the revelry hosted by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n"

 YnnDebate10Bloc1_1:0 "First, a tourney is held. It ends with a young squire almost beating an experienced knight double his size, but as the squire falls to the ground with a deadly wound in the middle of his chest, it appears there will be no such luck."
 YnnDebate10Bloc1_2:0 "The day’s festivities begin with a tourney. The joust is as popular as ever, skilled knights showcasing their ability with the saddle and the lance. This is followed by the general melee, where a variety of tactics are on display - heavily armored shield walls clash with pike formations popularized by cannorian settlers. For the lower classes, musketmen showcase their skill with the arquebus on the target range, the thundering of the guns joining with the cheering of the crowd.\n"
 YnnDebate10Bloc1_3:0 "The day’s festivities begin with a tourney. The joust is as popular as ever, skilled knights clad in enchanted plate showcase their ability with the saddle and the lance, each landed strike reverberating with magic and the tear of mystically enhanced muscle. For the lower class, archers showcase their skill with the bow on the target range, the twanging of bowstrings joining with the cheering of the crowd.\n"

 YnnDebate10Bloc2_3:0 "The afternoon’s main attraction is the canoe race along the raging Ynn. The canoeists are attacked by a lone river serpent, but by shielding each other in a compact formation and hitting it on the nuzzle with their paddles, they are able to fight it off without a casualty.\n"
 YnnDebate10Bloc3_1:0 "As evening nears, notable guests are invited into the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s hall for a feast. The lords laugh as more wine is poured and Ynnic history - ancient and recent - is reminisced."
 YnnDebate10Bloc3_2:0 "As evening nears, notable guests are invited into the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s hall for a feast. Cannorian dignitaries are also present, hailing from nearby pioneer settlements or further beyond from the land of Noruin or even Cannor itself - flattering the local lords, they draw comparisons between the history of their overseas homeland and that of the Ynn, finding many interesting parallels, but being careful to let the Ynn always emerge favourably in direct comparisons between the two."
 YnnDebate10Bloc3_3:0 "As evening nears, notable guests are invited into the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s hall for a feast. A few Cannorian dignitaries are present, hailing from nearby pioneer settlements or even from the Nether World - flattering the local lords, they applaud the glorious history of the Ynn, and acknowledge the Ynnic Empire as the first, greatest Empire elves ever created, the likeness of which will hardly be matched by those who can only wander in the darkness of the Nether World."
 
 ynn_debate.10.d2:0 "All the warriors are here, gathered for a day of revelry.\nFirst, a quick tournament is held. It ends when a nimble spear-fighter almost gets the best of a brawny, heavily-armoured companion: the crowd watches with bated breath but ultimately it is the spear-fighter's blood that is splattered over the gravel of the arena, a clear hit from the companion's battleaxe.\nThen, a javelin tossing competition. It finishes with only one person mangled by stray javelins as they clean up the throwing range, which is seen as a sign of good luck by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].\nAs evening nears, food and refreshments are brought. The finest wild game is rapidly picked apart by the warriors who don't miss the opportunity to boast and brag about their feats in the most recent battles.\n\nThe feast brims with eagerness - when will the next war be? The next fight? Will next week’s battle be against ferocious monsters or just more angry villagers? Regardless of the bloody future in store, it appears that everyone’s battle-lust is sated for this day.\n\nAs the festivities reach a high point, the warriors quiet down and stop talking to one another, turning to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], waiting for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to address the Companions."

With a musket any peasant with a week’s training can slay a valiant knight of the Ynn, their decades of training rendered useless by the deadly force of gunpowder.\n\n“Perhaps… we can compromise." one lord meekly proposes. “Transition our armies to one part muskets, one part pike-bearers."\n“That will never work!" a different lord, donning a shining armour with pride, interjects. “Knights face hardships by persevering, not by retreating or bargaining. We won't abandon our ways. We don't need to." his voice fills with hopefulness “I have a contact, one of the Nether Elves… who promises that if we bring him magical energy and resources, he will produce magical weapons and shields far surpassing even our wildest imagination!"\n\nThe promise, while doubtlessly shady, leaves its impression on the minds of the ruinborn present, who begin discussing the possibilities among themselves.

What's next? Pitchfork fighters? Malacnar is a kingdom of warriors, not rabble, and it will remain so."

It is a description of the ongoing debate over whether the Corrupted Ruinborn are in fact fellow Ynn-Chosen and all its constant arguments. And now, it seems, turbulence has struck some of our trade relations — the ongoing debate has made some of our neighbours wonder whether we are proper adherents of the Faith or if we are nigh-heretics, and the mistrust has seen them cancel contracts and send their merchant caravans elsewhere. But perhaps we'll do better without those ossified relations, and the opportunity to seek new partnerships?"

In the early evening, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] rested in a private garden, the Iosahar slipped in to discuss the ongoing debate over why the Ynnic Empire fell, and whether ultimate duty lies in the Emperor or in the subjects.\n\nAfter speaking quietly for a few minutes, [iosahar_private_talk.Monarch.GetName] finally paused, to listen to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reaction.
