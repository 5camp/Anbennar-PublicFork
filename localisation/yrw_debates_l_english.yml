 YRW_REFORM_TOOLTIP:0 "Are you sure you want to progress the current debate? Doing so could lead to revolts against our authority."

 debate_1_topic_tt:0 "When the Ending Flood washed over the world, it was believed that the elves along the River were the chosen survivors to claim the aftermath. However, some wonder if it is only those elves who live along the main river who are chosen or also those along the smaller tributaries."
 debate_2_topic_tt:0 "The Ynnic Empire was the strongest and longest lasting realm to exist within the Ynn Valley. Even so, it fell and ever since debates have raged over the true cause. Some say it was because the military power emperors had would break the army into civil war upon their deaths. Others claim that it fell due to decadent aristocrats who fought more among themselves than against the empire's enemies."
 debate_3_topic_tt:0 "The arrival of the Cannorians has brought new and strange weapons to the battlefield. While a rifle lacks the grace of a bow, many have begun to stockpile this new device. The question now presents to us whether we should adopt these cannorian guns for our own armies or if we should rely on the tactics that have served our people for centuries."
 debate_4_topic_tt:0 "It was recently believed that the Ynn River Valley was the fullest extent of the world and beyond the southern cliffs lay the Netherworld. However, these Cannorians have brought charts and maps from below the cliffs and much more. This has shaken the foundation of Ynn River Worship with clerics and commonfolk alike arguing over how these revelations should be interpreted."

 YnnDebate10Bloc0_2:0 "After months of anticipation and preparation, the guests have arrived - noble Ynnic knights, wealthy traders, and beautiful ladies fill the streets and sporting grounds of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Among this dazzling crowd, one could almost miss the rune-painted faces of Veykodan magicians and the lively robes sported by Epednar braves, as they haggle and laugh with Rzentur emissaries and Dolindhan squires, all thronging to the revelry hosted by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n"
 YnnDebate10Bloc0_3:0 "After months of anticipation and preparation, the guests have arrived - noble Ynnic knights, wealthy traders, and beautiful ladies fill the streets and sporting grounds of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Here the tongues of Sarda and Dolindha intertwine as the chosen people of the Ynn discuss the goings-on of the day and age, the chosen people of the Ynn thronging to the revelry hosted by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n"
 YnnDebate10Bloc1_1:0 "First, a tourney is held. It ends with a young squire almost beating an experienced knight double his size, but as the squire falls to the ground with a deadly wound in the middle of his chest, it appears there will be no such luck."
 YnnDebate10Bloc1_2:0 "The day’s festivities begin with a tourney. The joust is as popular as ever, skilled knights showcasing their ability with the saddle and the lance. This is followed by the general melee, where a variety of tactics are on display - heavily armored shield walls clash with pike formations popularized by cannorian settlers. For the lower classes, musketmen showcase their skill with the arquebus on the target range, the thundering of the guns joining with the cheering of the crowd.\n"
 YnnDebate10Bloc1_3:0 "The day’s festivities begin with a tourney. The joust is as popular as ever, skilled knights clad in enchanted plate showcase their ability with the saddle and the lance, each landed strike reverberating with magic and the tear of mystically enhanced muscle. For the lower class, archers showcase their skill with the bow on the target range, the twanging of bowstrings joining with the cheering of the crowd.\n"

 YnnDebate10Bloc2_2:0 "The afternoon’s main attraction is the canoe race along the raging Ynn. One racer manages to complete two laps at a stunning speed, blowing the other participants out of the water. To [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s delight, the racer represents the home team.\n"
 YnnDebate10Bloc2_3:0 "The afternoon’s main attraction is the canoe race along the raging Ynn. The canoeists are attacked by a lone river serpent, but by shielding each other in a compact formation and hitting it on the nuzzle with their paddles, they are able to fight it off without a casualty.\n"
 YnnDebate10Bloc3_1:0 "As evening nears, notable guests are invited into the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s hall for a feast. The lords laugh as more wine is poured and Ynnic history - ancient and recent - is reminisced."
 YnnDebate10Bloc3_2:0 "As evening nears, notable guests are invited into the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s hall for a feast. Cannorian dignitaries are also present, hailing from nearby pioneer settlements or further beyond from the land of Noruin or even Cannor itself - flattering the local lords, they draw comparisons between the history of their overseas homeland and that of the Ynn, finding many interesting parallels, but being careful to let the Ynn always emerge favourably in direct comparisons between the two."
 YnnDebate10Bloc3_3:0 "As evening nears, notable guests are invited into the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s hall for a feast. A few Cannorian dignitaries are present, hailing from nearby pioneer settlements or even from the Nether World - flattering the local lords, they applaud the glorious history of the Ynn, and acknowledge the Ynnic Empire as the first, greatest Empire elves ever created, the likeness of which will hardly be matched by those who can only wander in the darkness of the Nether World."
 
 ynn_debate.10.d2:0 "All the warriors are here, gathered for a day of revelry.\nFirst, a quick tournament is held. It ends when a nimble spear-fighter almost gets the best of a brawny, heavily-armoured companion: the crowd watches with bated breath but ultimately it is the spear-fighter's blood that is splattered over the gravel of the arena, a clear hit from the companion's battleaxe.\nThen, a javelin tossing competition. It finishes with only one person mangled by stray javelins as they clean up the throwing range, which is seen as a sign of good luck by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].\nAs evening nears, food and refreshments are brought. The finest wild game is rapidly picked apart by the warriors who don't miss the opportunity to boast and brag about their feats in the most recent battles.\n\nThe feast brims with eagerness - when will the next war be? The next fight? Will next week’s battle be against ferocious monsters or just more angry villagers? Regardless of the bloody future in store, it appears that everyone’s battle-lust is sated for this day.\n\nAs the festivities reach a high point, the warriors quiet down and stop talking to one another, turning to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], waiting for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to address the Companions."

Some Iosahar have been so outraged at our stance that they seek to end the feudal contract they agreed to, and break off from the dominion of [Root.GetName]. We will show them the error of their ways!"
 ynn_debate.19.a:0 "Fetch me a blade!"

 ynn_debate.21.t:0 "Hesitation"
 ynn_debate.21.d:0 "The issue of the Corrupted Ruinborn is a divisive one. If the Corrupted really are forsaken by the Ynn, then how is it they survived the Ending Flood? But then if they are saved,  what explains their wild nature? While the currents of faith might carry even the heaviest barge, the opposition might sink our hopes of resolving this issue if we maintain our chosen course. Is this the time to be pragmatic and lay our faith aside?"
 ynn_debate.21.a:0 "Perhaps we should not trust the Corrupted Ruinborn..."
 ynn_debate.21.b:0 "Perhaps we can trust the Corrupted Ruinborn..."
 ynn_debate.21.c:0 "No, we know our stance."

 ynn_debate.22.t:0 "Settle Debate"
 ynn_debate.22.d:0 "The ongoing back and forth on the debate of the Corrupted Ruinborn has been exhausting, and no middle ground has as of yet been found. If anything, the two sides have only become more entrenched in their positions, both attempting to win our favor. It might be in our best interest to put an end to the dispute once and for all, before this issue causes a lasting schism within our lands. Now might be a good time to end the nobility council, and call upon all our subjects to swear to uphold its conclusion."
 ynn_debate.22.a:0 "Yes, let's settle this."
 ynn_debate.22.b:0 "No, continue the debate."
 
 ynn_debate.23.t:0 "Concessions to the Opposition"
 ynn_debate.23.da:0 "While we favor the inclusion of all ruinborn of the Ynn tributaries as our fellow kin, it may be politically expedient to meet our opponents in the middle on some issues. Many scions of the great noble families fear that their status and prestige will diminish if we prevail in this debate, as if the supposed corruption of the tributary ruinborn would spread to them like a curse the moment they let them in.\n\nIf we continued to allow some of their discriminatory laws to exist so long as we clarify that they are targeted towards foreign customs and behaviours, and NOT towards being a "corrupted" per se - then we may pave a safer, if slower path towards acceptance."
 ynn_debate.23.db:0 "Although our firm stance against the integration of the Corrupted Ruinborn is unshaken, it may be politically expedient to… soften our tone somewhat. Some of our subjects might be persuaded to change sides to join us if we were to offer some form of compromise, such as allowing certain corrupted tribes to settle in our least desirable plots of land."

 ynn_debate.23.b:0 "Some things are not negotiable."
 ynn_debate.24.t:0 "Bribe Iosahar"
 ynn_debate.24.d:0 "The ongoing debate on the Corrupted Ruinborn has caused a significant increase in secret negotiations behind closed doors. While some of these negotiations contain heated debates of the righteousness of their cause, many are cold and transactional, with some plainly asking for gifts in return for a more amenable attitude towards us."

 ynn_debate.25.t:0 "Fight Breaks Out Amidst Debate"
 ynn_debate.25.d:0 "The debates on the Corrupted Ruinborn have always been heated, but it has now reached another level altogether. Fighting has broken out in the meeting halls, spilling over into the streets. The fighting was intense and did not last long, but has claimed several lives.\n\nOf course, both sides are immediately claiming the other party was at fault. Some haughty figures say they would never intend to spill blood over some Corrupted Ruinborn, to the loud protest of others. In the absence of real evidence, it seems it is up to us to decide what will be written in the history books."
 ynn_debate.25.a:0 "Side with [iosahar_a.GetName] who accepts the Corrupted."

 ynn_debate.26.t:0 "Iosahar Grow Impatient"
 ynn_debate.26.d:0 "As the debate on the Corrupted Ruinborn lags along, more and more we see false smiles at our feasts. We hear secrets whispered just out of understanding. Conversations end as we approach. It seems the debate might be shifting against us if we don’t act decisively."
 ynn_debate.26.a:0 "Better conclude soon…"
 ynn_debate.27.t:0 "A Shift in Popular Opinion"
 ynn_debate.27.d:0 "Recently, [iosahar_good_argument.GetName] has begun to send town criers throughout our realm in an attempt to influence the current debate. It is largely harmless, but it is strange to bring the debate from courtrooms to town squares. We may not pay it much heed, but it is an unorthodox approach to religious issues which are typically debated solely among the upper classes where peasant opinion means little."
 ynn_debate.27.a:0 "It appears to have had some effect on our subjects"
 ynn_debate.28.t:0 "Volunteers Flock to Our Banner"
 ynn_debate.28.d:0 "While the ongoing debate is very divisive, our participation is not without benefits. Our status as a leading voice in the discussion has led to large numbers of warriors, knights and adventurers who side with us flocking to our banner, ready to fight for their beliefs if it comes to it."
 ynn_debate.28.a:0 "Our cause is just, and we will prevail!"

 ynn_debate.29.d:0 "As [From.GetName] is debating the nature of the Corrupted Ruinborn, it is our duty as high priests of the Ynn to provide them with our guidance. As we speak for the sacred river, our words hold significant meaning in these matters, even beyond our own borders. Do we advise that those that dwell by the Ynnic tributaries are corrupted, or blessed?"

 ynn_debate.30.a:0 "Defame them."

 ynn_debate.31.t:0 "Rival Claims Authority"
 ynn_debate.31.d:0 "Disparaging our stance in the ongoing debate, a would-be pretender is claiming rightful authority over our religion. They claim that our stance makes us misguided, and unfit to rule. We could denounce them right back and seek direct confrontation, or just ignore them and hope the foolishness dies down eventually."
 ynn_debate.31.a:0 "Denounce them as a heretic!"
 ynn_debate.31.b:0 "Let them talk."
 ynn_debate.32.t:0 "State Terror?"
 ynn_debate.32.d:0 "Disagreement over the topic of the ongoing debate is one thing, but some among our vassals have taken it several steps further by openly insulting our decisions and trying to teach us how to rule. If we were to hire agents from the Order of the Mountain Eye to gaslight and harass one of our known worst detractors, it may be enough to scare the rest into falling in line."

 ynn_debate.33.t:0 "Uniting Against the Corrupted"
 ynn_debate.33.d:0 "Our firm stance against the emancipation of the Corrupted Ruinborn has led to a surge in support from many of our blessed subjects, who see us as a righteous shield against the outsiders. The division between us and the Corrupted Ruinborn has, in turn, healed divisions among ourselves."
 ynn_debate.33.a:0 "Our rule is steady."
 ynn_debate.34.t:0 "Suffer not the Corrupted"
 ynn_debate.34.d:0 "In a treasonous act of defiance, one of our Iosahar has declared that no matter the outcome of this debate, they will never accept the Corrupted Ruinborn as equal under the faith. Their disrespect to the debate is clear, and they will not hear arguments any longer."
 ynn_debate.34.a:0 "We will see to their arrogance later…"
 ynn_debate.35.t:0 "Upset Commoners"
 ynn_debate.35.d:0 "We have now spent months arguing for accepting the Corrupted as fellow Chosen. The Ynn saved us, and it saved them. We expected some to disagree but there's now a new thorn in our side, which we failed to anticipate: a group of commoners in our land have become increasingly upset over all the time we spent discussing the Corrupted, and not paying attention to their needs.\n\nThere's always grumbling about too-high taxes and [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s detachment — but the debate has made it boil over, and now some of them have raised a militia to free themselves from our rule!"
 ynn_debate.35.a:0 "All tributaries flow into the Ynn, all must obey the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 ynn_debate.36.t:0 "Volunteers from the Natives"
 ynn_debate.36.d:0 "Our fervent position on the acceptance of the Corrupted Ruinborn has not gone unnoticed among the Corrupted Ruinborn themselves, who are gladdened by our speaking on their behalf. As a token of kinship, a band of warriors from the Ynn tributaries has arrived in our lands, and has volunteered to return the favor, and fight under our banner."
 ynn_debate.36.a:0 "They will be vital should the need come."
 ynn_debate.37.t:0 "Native Chief Speaks Out"
 ynn_debate.37.d:0 "A local chief of a Corrupted Ruinborn tribe has begun preaching for the fair treatment of his people within our land. While it is advantageous to have his support, he is acting independently of us, and some of his arguments may reflect poorly upon our efforts. Besides this, the common folk he preaches to are not actually those who partake in the debates."
 ynn_debate.37.a:0 "It is good to have him on our side."
 ynn_debate.37.b:0 "He should learn to keep silent."
 ynn_debate.38.t:0 "Debate Impacts Trade Relations"
 ynn_debate.38.d:0 "Turbulence. It is when the Ynn churns, water turning white, breaking any branch or body it carries. It is a description of the ongoing debate over whether the Corrupted Ruinborn are in fact fellow Ynn-Chosen and all its constant arguments. And now, it seems, turbulence has struck some of our trade relations — the ongoing debate has made some of our neighbours wonder whether we are proper adherents of the Faith or if we are nigh-heretics, and the mistrust has seen them cancel contracts and send their merchant caravans elsewhere. But perhaps we'll do better without those ossified relations, and the opportunity to seek new partnerships?"
 ynn_debate.38.a:0 "We will have to make do on our own."
 ynn_debate.38.b:0 "This will bring us closer to our neighbors."
 ynn_debate.39.t:0 "Native General Joins"
 ynn_debate.39.d:0 "Our stance favoring the ruinborn of the tributaries has attracted the attention of one of them. A formidable warrior and clever strategist, he has offered his services as general to lead our troops. While our opponents in the debate may balk at serving under him, our supporters have been quick to argue that his strength and competence are clear proof of him being blessed by the Ynn."
 ynn_debate.39.a:0 "Our enemies shall tremble!"

 ynn_debate.43.t:0 "Concessions to the Opposition"

In the early evening, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] rested in a private garden, the Iosahar slipped in to discuss the ongoing debate over why the Ynnic Empire fell, and whether ultimate duty lies in the Emperor or in the subjects.\n\nAfter speaking quietly for a few minutes, [iosahar_private_talk.Monarch.GetName] finally paused, to listen to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reaction.

Or is something different this year..?\n\nAfter all, the ongoing debate which challenges the Iosahar system might be a good excuse to raise the dues owed to [Root.Capital.GetName].

 ynn_debate.77.d:0 "Before we came to the Ynn River valley and affiliated ourselves with its local people - who are now, we are proud to say, our friends and suzerain allies - we were Cannorians. We beheld the effects of our native weapons on our rivals, and we leveraged them as we headed into Aelantir. Now we are sworn as an Iosahar. We should share our experience with our peers."

 ynn_debate.78.d:0 "Our neighbours are now looking askance at us; in fact, they are claiming that we lack honor because we want to fight with guns.

 ynn_debate.89.t:0 "Theocracy weighs in on debate"
 ynn_debate.89.d:0 "[From.GetName] is debating whether Cannorian thinking has any value to the Ynn, or if it should be rejected along with any who seek to bring it here. It is our duty as high priests of the Ynn to provide them with our guidance. As we speak for the sacred river, our words hold significant meaning in these matters, even beyond our own borders. Which side do we fall on?"
 ynn_debate.89.a:0 "A tributary feeds the Ynn; Cannorian thought will aid our own"
 ynn_debate.89.a:0 "Their thought is at best valueless, at worst heretical!"

 ynn_debate.90.d:0 "[From.GetName] is undergoing a tumultuous religious debate as they seek to decide the merit of Cannorian thought in the Ynn.

 ynn_debate.90.b:0 "Inspire their vassals that still adhere to righteousness!"
 ynn_debate.90.c:0 "What concern is this to us?"
 ynn_debate.91.t:0 "Rival Claims Authority"
 ynn_debate.91.d:0 "A rival in our country has claimed authority over the running of our religion. This claim must be taken seriously, as it can only lead to instability. We have two choices: either let them talk and bear the consequences, or denounce them as a heretic, which while strengthening our position momentarily is certain to provoke a rebellion."
 ynn_debate.91.a:0 "Denounce this villain as a heretic - it is the truth!"
 ynn_debate.91.b:0 "Let them talk. They'll shut up eventually."
 ynn_debate.92.t:0 "State Terror?"
 ynn_debate.92.d:0 "Disagreement over the topic of the ongoing debate is one thing. But some among our vassals have taken it several steps further by showing signs of open disloyalty. If we were to make an example of one of the worst of our detractors, it may be enough to scare the rest into falling in line. But then again things like these have been known to backfire..."

 ynn_debate.93.t:0 "Cannorian Publications Flourish"
 ynn_debate.93.d:0 "Like a fire in kindling, like a weed in an unkept field, Cannorian publications have spread across [Root.GetName]. Intrigued by our public, impassioned, arguments, even some of the peasants have sought to learn about and from these foreign documents. And then, of course, demand sparks supply, as Cannorian traders bring more and more, straight from presses in Anbenncost and Konwell."
 ynn_debate.93.a:0 "Make sure the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] gets first choice!"
 ynn_debate.94.t:0 "A Good Book Drowning"
 ynn_debate.94.d:0 "The Ynn is holy, our savior from destruction and our protector even now. But that does not mean it does not carry detritus, at times, it is the nature of the great river that all -- good and bad -- will find themselves within in its flow in time.\n\nThus, our acts today, hurling Cannorian books, pamphlets, and other publications was not pollution. It was purification, the Ynn once again saving this land by burning the seemingly-innocuous works that would in fact lead to its destruction"
 ynn_debate.94.a:0 "The Ynn protects us once again!"
 ynn_debate.95.t:0 "Independent Cannorian Speaks Out"
 ynn_debate.95.d:0 "It seems that one of the so-called Ynnic "Overlords" is taking measures to reform their religion. As we understand it, the religion revolves around an obsession with the river they take their name from. Now, they are debating the Cannorians and what we adventurers mean for their little religion. This could be a chance for us to influence their religion to be more favorable to our way of life. We should tell them of the error of their ways and what we have to offer should they listen."
 ynn_debate.95.a:0 "We must share our wisdom."
 ynn_debate.96.t:0 "Thought Flourishes in [Root.GetName]"
 ynn_debate.96.d:0 "By encouraging the spread of Cannorian ideas among our people, we have sparked something of an intellectual renaissance among the scholars and thinkers of our country. Already, the court at [Root.Capital.GetName], which so often just seems a morass of political scheming and petty gossip, has been revived as a center of debate and inquiry. Cannorian thought may have been the seed for this renewal, but we the flourishing is all our own."
 ynn_debate.96.a:0 "Such fascinating ideas!"
 ynn_debate.97.t:0 "The Cannorian Menace"
 ynn_debate.97.d:0 "Nothing brings a people together like an enemy. And though our current foe fights mostly with ideas and publications, a corrosive poison hidden within, they are all the more deadly for their subtlety. We have made this clear to our people, and as a consequence, we are all more tightly bound together against the outsiders' threat."
 ynn_debate.97.a:0 "Let the chosen rejoice."
 ynn_debate.98.t:0 "A Cannorian Scandal"
 ynn_debate.98.d:0 "A trader arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] today, not bringing any Cannorian publications, but instead bringing news from the continent. Among other goings-on, we learned about a major scandal in the Anbennarian court, the kind of thing unthinkable to any true elf. We should pass this on to our overlord to inform the ongoing debate."
 ynn_debate.98.a:0 "Send a messenger to court, at once!"
 ynn_debate.99.t:0 "A Thinker From Cannor"
 ynn_debate.99.d:0 "Apparently, our defense of Cannorian thought has had echoes, all the way to that distant continent. Hearing that [Root.Capital.GetName] is a center for thinking in the Ynn (and fleeing a minor scandal, she said nothing about beng the local lord's daughter!) a pre-eminent thinker as arrived to offer his services to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 ynn_debate.102.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is sole ruler of [Root.GetName], but not all the realm seem to acknowledge that fact.

 ynn_debate.102.a:0 "Curses!"
 ynn_debate.103.t:0 "Dissidents Take Arms"
 ynn_debate.103.d:0 "The religious debate sparked by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has grown heated in recent months, but we never expected it to reach this level. Some people have taken the opposing stance with such a ferocity that they are out-right claiming [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a heretic for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] beliefs -- and that as such, their feudal contract is null and void. They have taken up arms to win their independence!"
 ynn_debate.103.a:0 "They are the heretics!"

 ynn_debate.104.d:0 "The on-going debate about the nature of our faith has consumed the thoughts of almost all in [Root.Capital.GetName], and of many across the realm. But not all. There are those who pay no heed to the great river, who deny its sacred wonder. In our distraction as we seek to resolve the religious dispute, they have seen opportunity. Swords have come down from the walls, farmers have taken up pitchforks -- they think that a little revolt while we are focused elsewhere will allow them to win greater local autonomy and decreased taxation."

None so misguided on the Ynn's truth can lead [Root.GetName]!"\n\nThat was all the madman in the [Root.Capital.GetName] town square got out before the local guards took him away. But, unfortunately, it is not so uncommon a sentiment nowadays -- with the country in turmoil, some of those who question the Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s stance on the ongoing religious debate also question [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] right to rule.

 ynn_debate.106.d:0 "The religious debate is not just a question for [Root.GetName], it will undoubtedly shape the course of the Ynn (or at least its worship) for years to come. And as such, it seems to have sprawled beyond our borders, reaching the neighbouring court of [angry_yrw_neighbor.Capital.GetName]. We have no concern if they wish to keep abreast of the goings-on in [Root.GetName], but now it seems they have chosen to interfere!\n\nA messenger from [angry_yrw_neighbor.Monarch.GetTitle] [angry_yrw_neighbor.Monarch.GetName] recently announced to all at court that [angry_yrw_neighbor.Monarch.GetHerHis] thinks our position is ludicrous and nigh-heretical 'as befits such a backwards country'.

As we attempt to settle some of the issues that have worn away at the base of Ynn River Worship, still others seek to take advantage of the situation. A local figurehead has been going town to town amassing a band of peasants. They rally against the crown claiming that while the nobles and clerics waste time debating how many drops make up the Ynn, the common elf is starving in their lord's field. Now, either by boldness or foolishness, this figurehead has presented himself at court. Calmly and eloquently, he states his case before $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. He seems to know much of the current debate. More than any typical commoner would. What's more, he recognizes that the revolts facing the $MONARCHTITLE$ are putting a strain on the army. He says that he would be more than willing to convince his followers to lay down their arms if he were gifted a landed title to his name.\n\nThe audacity to make such a request!
