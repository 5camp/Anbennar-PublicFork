 R62_serpentsbloom_rations_desc:0 "Deep in the hobgoblin ancestral memory are the days when we were forced to the Serpentspine's fringes, when we starved and died in the dark. When we took the Jade Mines from the dwarves, that changed -- the bioluminescent fungus known as Serpentbloom, abundant in cavern and road, provides all the nutrition a growing hobgoblin could require. \n\nTended to and prepared by slaves, it serves as our soldiers' primary means of supply. But as our military grows, so too must the Serpentbloom farms. The slaves will work, the crops will grow, and so the armies will march."

 R62_control_the_zanyu_kinunin_title:0 "Control the Zanyu Kinunin"
 R62_control_the_zanyu_kinunin_desc:0 "The orcs are simpleminded, yet a resilient, rowdy and stubborn race, making them effective slaves, yet, hard to control. Though these challenges are difficult, through a process of token reward, large amounts of movement, and enough discipline, even the toughest of orcs can be made to bend the knee.\n\nWith these new practices, no orc shall ever see freedom, it is their duty as a race to serve, and to obey The Command, for even the dumbest orc knows they are nothing without their master."

 R62_blades_and_spades_title:0 "Blades and Spades"
 R62_blades_and_spades_desc:0 "The orcs are fearsome warriors, as shown by large amounts of strength and an almost indomitable will. These traits, though applied well in the field of battle, are also able to be applied very effectively in our farms.\n\nWith our dispersal of the orcish race across Rahen, we’ve seen a large amount of increased output of crops among our farms with orc slaves. The effectiveness of these orcish yields across our land has been astonishing, and with this, we shall now continue this trend of orcish farmers and labourers in our domain.\n\nLet the orc not just toil in the field of battle, but also in the field of grain and rice."

 R62_tempered_rage_title:0 "Tempered Rage"
 R62_tempered_rage_desc:0 "Through our widespread practices of orcish slavery and disperal of their race across Rahen, a new kind of race, one from the intermingling of humans and orcs, has popped up. Due to them possessing orc blood, they are still fairly disorganized and easy for us to subdue. But, because they are still smarter than the average orc, they are perfect for more complex but menial production and administrative tasks. We shall continue observing the half-orcs, for they have been quite the asset."

 R62_honourable_half_orcs_title:0 "Honourable Half Orcs"
 R62_honourable_half_orcs_desc:0 "With the increasing numbers of half-orcs across our lands, especially in our Ninun enforced areas, they’ve seen a new identity, instead of being seen as bastards and outcasts, they are now seen as hard working craftsmen, dedicated to a sense of honor. With this new reputation, the half-orcs have now gained a much more honorable place among the human Wuhyun societies. With this new reputation, many more half-orcs have popped up across our domain, and even half-orc majorities in a few places have been seen. We should continue to encourage this reputation across our domain, for an honorable craftsman is a loyal craftsman."

 R62_the_evolution_of_warfare_desc:0 "Though tradition may dominate the minds of our people, pragmatism must take precedence on the field of battle. We have watched the rapid development of gunpowder weaponry with great interest, though up until now, bulky cannons simply acted as a poor substitute for a bound mage. But one cannot dwell on the past without risking the future. Guns shall roar, walls shall crumble, and the Great Command shall oversee it all, for such is the will of the Marshal."

Instrumental in both conventional and siege warfare, the Sunyanin dig trenches, tunnel underneath enemy fortresses, and ultimately bring about the downfall of [ROOT.GetName]’s many enemies. In this sense, the Sunyanin plays an integral part in all military campaigns, and as such must constitute the best of the female officer corps."

 R62_prepare_the_troops_desc:0 "The scouts return to us with a clear picture of the terrain: rolling hills and verdant plains, perfect for marching through, with even seasons and familiar edible crops grown by the local populaces easily raided and used to feed our men.\n\nThe land at once appears simple and perhaps even serene, but it would be mistaken to assume the people are similarly so. Dedicated training halls for warriors of varying backgrounds and strategies populate the towns and cities, and every village is guarded by some militarized force. Knowledge on these fighting techniques is fragmented and sourced mostly from northern infiltrations, but there no doubt could be an endless amount of these strategies capable of catching our troops off-guard from villages uncountable.\n\nWith present knowledge, we estimate that these Xia states can field around two to three Kikun, a force as numerous as our own. A challenge for sure, and a worthy one for our new commander."

 R62_the_battle_of_shanyutian_title:0 "The Battle of Shanyutian"
 R62_the_battle_of_shanyutian_desc:0 "This is a post-battle report detailing the specifics of our victorious Xianje campaign, written approximately two months since our triumph at Shanyutian. Information presented is based on first-hand accounts of commanders and surviving frontline soldiers.\n\nThe Xia forces crashed upon our frontlines, pursuing combat with our troops with a supernatural fervor, those that were isolated into one-on-one combat were made into corpses. Our forces adapted quickly enough upon order from local commanders, ensuring that no deviation from an inter-locked shield wall was allowed, as our worgs and boar riders harried them with advances too quick to effectively counter.\n\nThe result was a victory, among the largest of the campaigns. Inserted beneath this report is an updated report of lost troops and armaments during the course of the battle, high command may find it peculiar."

 R62_start_the_xiadao_campaign_title:0 "Start the Xiadao Campaign"
 R62_start_the_xiadao_campaign_desc:0 "The land of the Xia is split among dozens of states, all vying for power under the yoke of a ruler with only nominal control over its internal tribes. Still, it appears that this nominal control is enough to bind its subjects to protect the ruler upon a war's declaration. Every last one of them, all pledged to defend the ruler of the Xia - and in turn, the land itself - to the last man.\n\nThis report puts forward a request to cease preparations and begin the campaign immediately. Based on present information, their forces can converge and unify within a matter of days. If we are to ensure a quick and decisive victory, we must act before the commander of the Xia can muster its splintered manpower into a united force capable of rivaling ours."

 R62_dissolve_the_mists_title:0 "Dissolve the Mists"
 R62_dissolve_the_mists_desc:0 "The issue of the odd, "mystical" mists as described by some troops has come to a head. For too long have our troops met their end at an untimely matter, clashing head-to-head with a force neither guns nor steel can banish... so far.\n\nWe have identified sources of this mist, its properties derived from local legendary sites. Artificers under our employ, whose names and achievements can be seen in the attached parchment, have identified certain solutions for this ethereal menace, which we may be rid ourselves of with decisive action and a hefty sum to compensate these individuals. The northern Oni have also volunteered themselves to banish this mist with a degree of malevolent fervor, not that it concerns us what their reason may be, just that it be done as soon as possible."

 R62_victor_of_the_xiadao_title:0 "Victor of the Xiadao"
 R62_victor_of_the_xiadao_desc:0 "Great tidings from the front. The prized city of the Xiaken and its respective temple and fort have been brought into our fold. Many will herald this moment as the day the war was won, and all the Xia were doomed to fall to our hands. The truth I may posit comes down to our superior management of supply lines and discipline, but I fear that may be a side of history that will go unremembered. The truth that the war was won the moment we set our eyes on this land ripe for conquest."

 R62_inspect_the_temple_title:0 "Inspect the Temple"
 R62_inspect_the_temple_desc:0 "This is an inventory report of the spoils received during the Xiadao campaign and its subsequent looting. As of the current date this is an incomplete report, much has been left unaccounted for, and looters from our less disciplined ranks can find themselves suffering from their impatience. One thing can be said for sure, however, and that is that these monks did not live as modestly as they claimed. Several tons of gold and precious stones have been smelted down and repurposed into bars, to be carted to the capital as soon as enough worgs can be procured for such a task.\n\nAnyway, beginning with the ornate combs..."

 R62_shattering_the_alliance_title:0 "Shattering the Alliance"
 R62_shattering_the_alliance_desc:0 "This is a report from Xiadao central intelligence. The stragglers have been neutralized, all that remains now are silent fields and a subservient populace. The marches and mock battles that used to harry the townspeople with their grating, noisy disunity are gone - replaced with the melodious sound of hobgoblin troops patrolling the land. True and final victory has been achieved."

 R62_start_the_shamakhad_campaign_title:0 "Start the Shamakhad Campaign"
 R62_start_the_shamakhad_campaign_desc:0 "Mere decades have passed since we destroyed the disorganized kingdoms of northern Shamakhad, but our dominance over the region remains contested. The Marshals know this is unacceptable. We must therefore pacify the southern holdouts and cement our control over these fertile plains."

 R62_seize_the_ancient_cities_title:0 "Seize the Ancient Cities"
 R62_seize_the_ancient_cities_desc:0 "While Shamakhad is an old and wealthy land, there are certain cities in this region that are older and wealthier than the rest. With these cities in our hands, we would be able to exert our authority over all of Shamakhad. Let us thus expand our dominion and incorporate these territories into this Great Command."

 R62_a_final_ruin_title:0 "A Final Ruin"
 R62_a_final_ruin_desc:0 "Our dominance over Shamakhad is undisputed, and all of those who would deny this basic fact have been brought to heel. The time has come for us to rest, and till the fields, and fill our granaries and warehouses, before preparations for the next campaign begin anew."

 R62_the_ramp_of_sarnihanpur_title:0 "The Ramp of Sarnihanpur"
 R62_the_ramp_of_sarnihanpur_desc:0 "Our human subjects say that Sarnihanpur is the oldest city in Rahen, but such a pedigree has not been of much use to it. We have surrounded it, and its inhabitants are resisting us fiercely. One thing must be said, though; they fight well, and our casualties are mounting.\n\nThe time has come to commit to breaking Sarnihanpur, and our engineers have just the solution - a mammoth ramp, extending from the rolling plains that surround the city to arc over the walls. We will defend this ramp against all attacks, and once it is completed, we shall surge over the walls and put an end to this thorn in our side."

 R62_the_spoils_of_war_title:0 "The Spoils of War"

Its granaries have been yoked to our supply lines, and its vaults shall fund our future campaigns. Its people, too, shall labour on the fields and in our mines, in service to our Great Command. Our rule over Shamakhad is now ironclad."

In six years, all of Dhujat had been occupied… all but one city. Now, as hundreds of artillery crews train their sights on Khiraspid’s walls, the Command is preparing to make an example of the Porcelain Gate - one that Rahen shall not soon forget."

 R62_start_the_dhujat_campaign_desc:0 "Wealthy and dominated by enormous urban conurbations, most notably the Porcelain Cities, Dhujat straddled both banks of the Kharunyana, making it a truly vital region to control for any aspiring conqueror. Moreover, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the region was politically divided, leaving the path to conquest wide open. Thus, in 1507, the Command invaded Pordhatti in its first thrust into Dhujat."

 R62_down_the_great_river_desc:0 "The Porcelain Cities have seen sense, and have submitted to our rule. Our dominion has expanded once more, encompassing the length of the Kharunyana, but now is not a time for rest, because there are enemies all around, and constant conquest is a necessity in a world such as this. Dhujat, after all, is but a stepping-stone to greater things."

 R62_the_fate_of_the_oracle_title:0 "The Fate of the Oracle"
 R62_the_fate_of_the_oracle_desc:0 "The Oracles of Tughayasa are said to be wise beyond measure, which is all well and good. A more relevant trait, however, is that many humans hold them in high esteem, which would make them a useful servant to have, as having their support would greatly reduce unrest within our human-majority territories. Moreover, it may be possible to weaponize their esoteric knowledge to secure more victories in the future. Once Tughayasa is secured, the Grand Marshal should pay them a visit  and see what they have to say for themselves."

 R62_the_heart_of_haless_title:0 "The Heart of Haless"
 R62_the_heart_of_haless_desc:0 "There are many great and wealthy cities in Dhujat, but the greatest of them all is indisputably Sarisung. Located at the confluence of the rivers Kharunyana and Telkhram, it may well be the most strategically significant settlement in all of Haless. To start with, however, Dhujat will suffice. For our control over this region to be uncontested, we must seize it from its current owners."

 R62_order_out_of_chaos_title:0 "Order Out of Chaos"
 R62_order_out_of_chaos_desc:0 "We have restored order in Dhujat, which is no small feat, since - to our understanding - the region has been embroiled in chaos for quite some time. However, it is one thing to restore order, and quite another to maintain it. As such, we shall invest five Yuyuanin within Sarisung as a rapid reaction force ever-ready to quash rebellions and uprisings against our rule."

Some of the humans of West Rahen in many ways live similarly to how we once did before our rise to greatness – pastoral herders divided by petty feuding over grazing rights. Others live in lavish fortresses watching over the rushing rivers which divide the region. It is critical this strategic region be brought to heel.\n\nOur intelligence reports the land is split between the Narajandi and Dhenbasana rivers, one flowing north and the other south. With them under our control, the western border of our domain will be all but secure, and open the path towards the wealthiest lands of Rahen and Haless."

At worst, they defy us with ferocity, and at best they still persist in blissful unawareness of our existence. We request orders as how to best control these areas.” -Missive from Grand Captain Bekun Wolfborn\n\nIt has been decreed that in order to solidify control over these areas, Senunin shall be dispatched to demand oaths of loyalty from each patriarch. Should they refuse, the family lines they hold so sacred shall be severed. Such are the demands of the Grand Marshal."

 the_command.0.t:0 "The Great Command"
 the_command.0.d:0 "The humans feared. Creatures in the dark, angry spirits in the night. And, when they looked to the looming Serpentspine, they feared an unending tide of savage monsters, the stuff of exiled dwarves' tales. The hobgoblins tribes who lived in the foothills were a pest and a nuisance, but merely that. They feared the wrong thing.\n\nThat is obvious as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] surveys the armies assembled before him in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Off to one side lay the Ninyu Kikun, the High Marshal's elite; on the other, the slave state rabble of the Zanyu Kikunin. Standing before him, straight in salute, the Wolf Marshal, the Lion Marshal, the Boar Marshal, their armies behind them.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] holds their eyes for a second, then two then three, before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze moves on, drawn to the massive banners of looted silk, each marshal's subordinate generals accompanied by a standard-bearer.\n\nBeyond that, bodies seem to blur together. But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would see, know the strict organization that governs every body in this vast plain. The Nosuinin, lead by two of the infantry's lieutenant-generals, with six divisions each. Four regiments per division, four banners per regiment, eight bands per banner and three teams per band. Ten soldiers in a team, all of whom hope to one day rise and command one of those grouping themselves.\n\nOn the flanks, the Gikunin cavalry: three worg-riding clans, elite in their respective Commands and given the massive wolves to train and ride. Some say the Worg-Lieutenants and Crested Riders who serve as subordinates here are nigh-bestial themselves, but such voices are few and far between -- their charges tend not to leave survivors.\n\nThis is the Hobgoblin army. This is the Great Command. This is what Haless, Halann, will soon learn to fear."

 the_command.1.d:0 "The city of Sir is our most recent conquest in eastern Shamakhad. Before its defeat it had become a beacon of resistance and still many Shamakhadi warriors remained gathered there, hidden underground. Now finally they have risen up in revolt in a futile attempt to fight their way to freedom. We need to bring them down, before they get any ideas!"
 the_command.1.a:0 "All disorder will be crushed!"
 the_command.2.t:0 "Orcish Slaves in [Root.GetName]"
 the_command.2.d:0 "Our ancient origins tell tales of endless wars in the Jade Mines against the savage orcs. Eventually, with the rise of The Command, we crushed disorganized orc clans and put them in chains. With their spirit is broken ever since, they have become our loyal workhorses and cannon fodder for our domains. If the humans of Rahen and beyond will not work for us, then we shall use our orcish assets to work on the fertile fields of the surface-world in their stead!"

The Hobgoblins are by far the greatest threat to the Oni, if we could temporarly deal with that threat, we could focus on the threats to the south and east and grow strong enough to no longer fear them. The Hobgoblins' incessant warring with the Humans and Harimari of Rahen mean they will be seeking all advantages they can get. We can use this opportunity to offer them some assistance in exchange for peace."
