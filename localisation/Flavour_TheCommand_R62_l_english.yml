 the_command.0.t:0 "The Great Command"
 the_command.0.d:0 "The humans feared. Creatures in the dark, angry spirits in the night. And, when they looked to the looming Serpentspine, they feared an unending tide of savage monsters, the stuff of exiled dwarves' tales. The hobgoblins tribes who lived in the foothills were a pest and a nuisance, but merely that. They feared the wrong thing.\n\nThat is obvious as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] surveys the armies assembled before him in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Off to one side lay the Ninyu Kikun, the High Marshal's elite; on the other, the slave state rabble of the Zanyu Kikunin. Standing before him, straight in salute, the Wolf Marshal, the Lion Marshal, the Boar Marshal, their armies behind them.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] holds their eyes for a second, then two then three, before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze moves on, drawn to the massive banners of looted silk, each marshal's subordinate generals accompanied by a standard-bearer.\n\nBeyond that, bodies seem to blur together. But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would see, know the strict organization that governs every body in this vast plain. The Nosuinin, lead by two of the infantry's lieutenant-generals, with six divisions each. Four regiments per division, four banners per regiment, eight bands per banner and three teams per band. Ten soldiers in a team, all of whom hope to one day rise and command one of those grouping themselves.\n\nOn the flanks, the Gikunin cavalry: three worg-riding clans, elite in their respective Commands and given the massive wolves to train and ride. Some say the Worg-Lieutenants and Crested Riders who serve as subordinates here are nigh-bestial themselves, but such voices are few and far between -- their charges tend not to leave survivors.\n\nThis is the Hobgoblin army. This is the Great Command. This is what Haless, Halann, will soon learn to fear."
 the_command.0.a:0 "Beat the drums of war!"
 the_command.1.t:0 "Shamakhad Resistance"
 the_command.1.d:0 "The city of Sir is our most recent conquest in eastern Shamakhad. Before its defeat it had become a beacon of resistance and still many Shamakhadi warriors remained gathered there, hidden underground. Now finally they have risen up in revolt in a futile attempt to fight their way to freedom. We need to bring them down, before they get any ideas!"
 the_command.1.a:0 "All disorder will be crushed!"
 the_command.2.t:0 "Orcish Slaves in [Root.GetName]"
 the_command.2.d:0 "Our ancient origins tell tales of endless wars in the Jade Mines against the savage orcs. Eventually, with the rise of The Command, we crushed disorganized orc clans and put them in chains. With their spirit is broken ever since, they have become our loyal workhorses and cannon fodder for our domains. If the humans of Rahen and beyond will not work for us, then we shall use our orcish assets to work on the fertile fields of the surface-world in their stead!"
 the_command.2.a:0 "Even chaos itself can be useful when put in chains."
 the_command.3.t:0 "The Rule of $MONARCH$ $DYNASTY$"
 the_command.3.d:0 "The ascension of $MONARCH$ to the position of Grand Marshal heralds a new era. With their $DYNASTY$ origins, they will surely favour their home Command. Soon the court will be dominated by their brethren and the Command will be dominated by the $DYNASTY$."
 the_command.3.a:0 "The time of the Wolf has come!"
 the_command.3.b:0 "The time of the Boar has come!"
 the_command.3.c:0 "The time of the Lion has come!"

 the_command.4.t:0 "Offer to the Hobgoblins"
 the_command.4.d:0 "We are surrounded by enemies, the recently united bird riders to our west, the accursed followers of the so called Righteous Path to the south, and the so-called Hobgoblin Command to the east. The Hobgoblins are by far the greatest threat to the Oni, if we could temporarly deal with that threat, we could focus on the threats to the south and east and grow strong enough to no longer fear them. The Hobgoblins' incessant warring with the Humans and Harimari of Rahen mean they will be seeking all advantages they can get. We can use this opportunity to offer them some assistance in exchange for peace." 
 the_command.4.a:0 "It is necessary."
 the_command.4.b:0 "The Oni will not be reduced to mere servants!"
 the_command.5.t:0 "The Rashenbir's Offer"
 the_command.5.d:0 "Diplomats of the Rashenbir of Azjakuma have offered the assistance of their magics in our conquest in exchange for peace. The Oni have been living in the Demon Hills for millennia practicing their magic and repelling invaders. Though not an impossible foe to conquer, the cost of doing so may not currently be worth it."
 the_command.5.a:0 "Their magic will prove invaluable."
 the_command.5.b:0 "We do not need their petty tricks."
 the_command.6.t:0 "You shouldn't get this event"
 the_command.6.d:0 "it is unused"
 the_command.7.t:0 "The Hobgoblins Refuse"
 the_command.7.d:0 "The Hobgoblin Command has refused our generous offers of assistance. We can only assume they are either looking down on us, or preparing to invade."
 the_command.7.a:0 "They will regret this."
 the_command.8.t:0 "You shouldn't get this event"
 the_command.8.d:0 "it is unused"
