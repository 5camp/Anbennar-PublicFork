 R62_the_marching_of_boots_title:0 "The Marching of Boots"
 R62_the_marching_of_boots_desc:0 "Verdant farmland. Grasping jungle. Mist-draped hills. We march over each, and take them all for own. None shall make us falter, none shall see us cease, and soon all Haless will known the rhythm of our boots."

 R62_the_beating_of_drums_title:0 "The Beating of Drums"
 R62_the_beating_of_drums_desc:0 "Ferocious battle. Bitter siege. The long, long, march of a legion out of [Root.Capital.GetName]. The drums sound for each, reverberating through shield and spear and spine, and all who hear it know they shall soon live according to our beat."

 R62_the_howling_of_horns_title:0 "The Howling of Horns"
 R62_the_howling_of_horns_desc:0 "Fervent battlecry. Whispered defiance. Cannon thunder. Each and everyone is drowned out in the blare of our signal-horns and triumph-horns, just as Haless is drowned in our rule."

 R62_serpentsbloom_rations_title:0 "Serpentbloom Rations"
 R62_serpentsbloom_rations_desc:0 "Deep in the hobgoblin ancestral memory are the days when we were forced to the Serpentspine's fringes, when we starved and died in the dark. When we took the Jade Mines from the dwarves, that changed -- the bioluminescent fungus known as Serpentbloom, abundant in cavern and road, provides all the nutrition a growing hobgoblin could require. \n\nTended to and prepared by slaves, it serves as our soldiers' primary means of supply. But as our military grows, so too must the Serpentbloom farms. The slaves will work, the crops will grow, and so the armies will march."

 command_serpentsbloom_tt:0 "Every owned province with Serpentbloom will gain the following modifier:"

 R62_control_the_zanyu_kinunin_title:0 "Control the Zanyu Kinunin"
 R62_control_the_zanyu_kinunin_desc:0 "The orcs are simpleminded, yet a resilient, rowdy and stubborn race, making them effective slaves, yet, hard to control. Though these challenges are difficult, through a process of token reward, large amounts of movement, and enough discipline, even the toughest of orcs can be made to bend the knee.\n\nWith these new practices, no orc shall ever see freedom, it is their duty as a race to serve, and to obey The Command, for even the dumbest orc knows they are nothing without their master."

 R62_blades_and_spades_title:0 "Blades and Spades"
 R62_blades_and_spades_desc:0 "The orcs are fearsome warriors, as shown by large amounts of strength and an almost indomitable will. These traits, though applied well in the field of battle, are also able to be applied very effectively in our farms.\n\nWith our dispersal of the orcish race across Rahen, we’ve seen a large amount of increased output of crops among our farms with orc slaves. The effectiveness of these orcish yields across our land has been astonishing, and with this, we shall now continue this trend of orcish farmers and labourers in our domain.\n\nLet the orc not just toil in the field of battle, but also in the field of grain and rice."

 R62_tempered_rage_title:0 "Tempered Rage"
 R62_tempered_rage_desc:0 "Through our widespread practices of orcish slavery and disperal of their race across Rahen, a new kind of race, one from the intermingling of humans and orcs, has popped up. Due to them possessing orc blood, they are still fairly disorganized and easy for us to subdue. But, because they are still smarter than the average orc, they are perfect for more complex but menial production and administrative tasks. We shall continue observing the half-orcs, for they have been quite the asset."

 R62_honourable_half_orcs_title:0 "Honourable Half Orcs"
 R62_honourable_half_orcs_desc:0 "With the increasing numbers of half-orcs across our lands, especially in our Ninun enforced areas, they’ve seen a new identity, instead of being seen as bastards and outcasts, they are now seen as hard working craftsmen, dedicated to a sense of honour. With this new reputation, the half-orcs have now gained a much more honourable place among the human Wuhyun societies. With this new reputation, many more half-orcs have popped up across our domain, and even half-orc majorities in a few places have been seen. We should continue to encourage this reputation across our domain, for an honourable craftsman is a loyal craftsman."

 R62_new_schools_of_thought_title:0 "New Schools of Thought"
 R62_new_schools_of_thought_desc:0 "Our campaign in debate hall is as successful as any other, and we have convinced many of the High Philosophies’ followers that our ideology is the way of the future. But the process has not been a war, in truth. Some of their schools of thought are so similar to the ideas of Godlost that we agree with them more than debate.\n\nThese schools all have their original places of conception, where the finest of their philosophers gather. If we were to occupy these lands, we could discuss ideas with Rahen’s best, and through that perhaps even sharpen our own understanding of duty and honour."

 R62_teach_and_learn_title:0 "Teach and Learn"
 R62_teach_and_learn_desc:0 "There is much to teach the people of Haless, and few places to do it. Simply building more schools will help this problem, but we must ensure that what is taught there does not conflict with our values. Once we have a large enough network, we can establish a curriculum for the schools to follow."

 R62_philosophy_of_state_and_blood_title:0 "Philosophy of State and Blood"
 R62_philosophy_of_state_and_blood_desc:0 ""There are only two groups in this world: us, and them. Everyone who works as a part of our state is us - they are members of our one united family and will be afforded the respect that such membership entails. Race, creed, and history are no barrier to joining the family that is the state - only one's efforts matter. Those who oppose the state, however, are them. They have chosen to reject the family, and they will stop at nothing to see us destroyed. It is only our combined strength and faith in one another that will see us outlast them. In the end there can be no peace between us and them - only blood."\n\n-Gottami of the Elephant Herd, one of the most fervent and prominent advocates behind the rise of Nationalist teachings in the early 16th century."

 R62_a_good_marshal_title:0 "A Good Marshal"
 R62_a_good_marshal_desc:0 "All great families are built upon trust. So too then, must the Great Command. While our push for a stronger national identity has been successful, we still hold to the idea that a marshal must prove their strength to lead our great nation.\n\nThis shall be the case no longer. If we are to trust one another, we must also trust our leader. Respect shall be a given; any marshal is a good marshal, until proven otherwise."

 R62_virtues_embodied_title:0 "Virtues Embodied"
 R62_virtues_embodied_desc:0 "Many [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s have led the Great Command. Most have lead us to victory, some few exalting in a succession of glorious campaigns.\n\nBut none have rivalled [Root.Monarch.GetName]. He is honour, he is discipline, he is strategic brilliance and martial acuity. And as he studies the War Room's maps, sketching out the next campaign and all that comes after, you can see the face of Haless -- the future of Haless -- reshaped within his eyes."

 R62_secure_logistics_title:0 "Secure Logistics"
 R62_secure_logistics_desc:0 "The Wolf, the great beast after which one of our commands is named, stands for many of our nation's greatest virtues, one of them being the well-trained wargs and secure paths that supply our troops throughout Rahen.\n\nIt is their job, their honour, their responsibility to keep our command running, in both the literal and implied meaning. A robust network of roads, in the style of the once-great golden highway, with way-stations and patrol houses will give our messengers"

 R62_supply_the_kikunin_title:0 "Supply the Kikunin"
 R62_supply_the_kikunin_desc:0 "Kikun - our Army, the beating drums and hearts of our nation. Our world and pride revolve around the soldiers that put their lives at risk to further push into Rahen. As they stray further and further away from their homes they need to be supplied with all they need, food being the foremost of all. As is often said, an army marches on its stomach."

 R62_calm_down_sir_title:0 "Calm Down Sir"
 R62_calm_down_sir_desc:0 "“This revolt in Sir marks the first major instance of the conquered rebelling. Our response here is a message to every place and people in Haless. It should be a clear one.”\n\n-The Wolf Martial, report to the War Room, two days after the uprising in Sir."

 R62_disarming_the_conquered_title:0 "Disarming the Conquered"
 R62_disarming_the_conquered_desc:0 "Spears, swords, and guns are needed in many places in the Great Command. They must stream from our workshops, they must be available for training, they must be abundant on the frontlines. But where they cannot be is in the hands of the conquered."

 R62_strange_yet_familiar_title:0 "Strange Yet Familiar"
 R62_strange_yet_familiar_desc:0 "We expected resistance as we imposed our philosophies in conquered lands, for even with a war done there are battles to fight. But in Kamapar we have found the opposite: the locals’ personal philosophies seem to blend well with Godlost ways and already they are debating and discussing its finer points -- a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."

 R62_an_exaltation_of_man_title:0 "An Exaltation of Man"
 R62_an_exaltation_of_man_desc:0 "“Honour. Discipline. Loyalty. These are what make a hobgoblin. These are what make up The Great Command.\n\n“Among the conquered there are those with honour. Those with discipline. Those with loyalty. They are a spear to be sharpened, a blade to be honed. They will serve, and will serve us well.”\n-[Root.Monarch.GetName], ending the War Room’s lengthy debate over whether humans have a place in the army."

 R62_permit_debate_title:0 "Permission of Debate"
 R62_permit_debate_desc:0 "The humans of Haless have demonstrated two things we did not expect: the capacity to possess honour, and the ability to think like us as well. Perhaps it would be prudent to promote discussion with the humans by constructing buildings of learning.\n\nProgress has never been achieved by ignorance; it is possible we may learn something from their “High Philosophy”."

 R62_children_of_the_kusonin_title:0 "Children of the Kusonin"
 R62_children_of_the_kusonin_desc:0 "‘A spear in reserve\nA sword, held high, not fallen\nIn the breeze, Wuhyun’\n\n-The Breeze, 1601, one of the many poems that emerged from the Kusonin’s unique style."

 R62_adoptive_clans_title:0 "Adoptive Clans"
 R62_adoptive_clans_desc:0 "With pressures mounting from within and without, the burden upon the clans grows too great to bear. We must take action, and soon, for the good of this newfound empire, built upon the back of unity. To threaten such a notion would be catastrophic, but to lose all that we have built would be far worse.\n\nBut all is well, for hobgoblins understand the notion of family far better than other races, with family presiding over all else -- even one’s own nation. For those unfortunate many whose families have been pruned by war, let us encourage the adoption and merging of tattered families into new, adoptive clans."

 R62_the_ten_reforms_title:0 "The Ten Reforms"
 R62_the_ten_reforms_desc:0 "As the Empire grows, so too does the stress upon our social systems. No longer are we a people huddled tightly in the caverns of the Jade Mines. Thousands of feet march to the beat of booming drums, rhythmic gunfire, and the melodic clangor of steel and yet the homesteads to which each soldier longs to return are in peril. Necessity breeds action, and despite our reservations, the time has come to codify the law under one central authority so that no individual may shirk their responsibility.\n\nThe Ten Reforms shall be engraved in stone so that they may stand eternal, just as we stand resolute in the face of an enemy bearing down upon us. They shall detail the social, legal, and administrative codes that all must follow for the edification of each individual, and the permanence of the Great Command as a whole."

 R62_strengthen_the_ninyu_kikun_title:0 "Strengthen the Ninyu Kikun"
 R62_strengthen_the_ninyu_kikun_desc:0 "There was an idea. To bring together a group of remarkable soldiers from Boar, Wolf, and Lion. To see if they could become -- something more. So when the Great Command needed them, they could fight the battles that an individual kikun never could.\n\nThe Ninyu Kikun have served, and served well. It is time to expand and strengthen their forces: from a small group of the Grand Marshal's elite, into a proper combined army, able to bring together the strengths of all the tribes into one cohesive force."

 R62_the_war_room_title:0 "The War Room"
 R62_the_war_room_desc:0 "The Great Command is a federation of the three clans: Boar, Wolf, and Lion. Across our nation, there are hundreds of fortifications, a dozen major hobgoblin cities, three great warcamps. But there is only one War Room.\n\nHere, the Marshals who rule each Command debate strategy and tactics. Here, the Grand Marshal sends the orders initiating the next campaign. And here, we remake the future of Haless."

 R62_the_support_of_the_marshals_title:0 "The Support of the Marshals"
 R62_the_support_of_the_marshals_desc:0 "Three marshals, three Commands. This trinity has guided us from the Jade Mines into Rahen, and will lead us even further beyond.\n\nWithout them the Grand Marshal is powerless. But with their support, we can achieve feats that will rival even the conquest of Jaher."

 R62_build_new_households_title:0 "Build New Households"
 R62_build_new_households_desc:0 "As we prepare for departure from the dark depths of the Serpentspine into our newly conquered land in Rahen, we must build houses -- houses to live in, to train in, to work in, houses, that will be home to generations of hobgoblins, where grandfathers will teach the young in our ancestral ways."

 R62_moving_camp_title:0 "Moving Camp"
 R62_moving_camp_desc:0 "The time is nigh, the day has come: We have prepared supplies, farms, homes. We have garnered the support of the marshals. Now it is time for us to finally leave the Serpentspine behind. It is time to move camp!"

 R62_digging_in_title:0 "Digging In"
 R62_digging_in_desc:0 "In truth, no matter how brutal or bloody the campaign, conquest only marks the beginning of the war that must be waged to rule a territory. What remains is the long haul of eliminating rebels, responding to unrest, and pacifying the land. The anchors of such warfare are well-constructed and well-readied forts, a base for responding to any disturbances, and just as we ensure our armies are well-equipped we must ensure our forts are well-manned."

 R62_a_changing_diet_title:0 "A Changing Diet"
 R62_a_changing_diet_desc:0 "Long long ago, we were forced to the surface, scrabbling out a life from hunting and gathering. But in the centuries after we won our way back to dominate the Jade Mines, our warriors have lived and died on a diet of serpentbloom, fungus, and other such subterranean foods.\n\nBut now that is changing. Our surface farms recover from war, and yield vast amounts of wheat, rice, and legumes of all kinds -- as such our rations are evolving, and we are evolving with them."

 R62_life_under_the_sun_title:0 "Life Under the Sun"
 R62_life_under_the_sun_desc:0 "“Ah, Wolf Marshal, a hunt after these logistics are done?”\n“Perhaps another time, Standardbearer, I have commitments in the afternoon.”\n\n“Oh! A long day in the war room? Consulting the latest maps of the front? An inspection of troops?”\n\n“No. You see, I promised my son I would teach him how to worg-ride…”\n\n-Overheard at the strategic tents in the Great Warcamp of [Root.Capital.GetName]"

 R62_the_wuhyun_title:0 "The Wuhyun"
 R62_the_wuhyun_desc:0 "“To be Wuhyun is to be a man of honour, but what is honour? I answer you, honour is this: do not lie, do not be insincere, do not be obsequious, do not be superficial, do not be greedy, do not be rude, do not be boastful, do not be arrogant, do not slander, do not be unfaithful, be on good terms with comrades, do not be overly concerned with events, show concern for one another, be compassionate, with a strong sense of duty.\n\n“To be Wuhyun is more than merely the swiftness of one’s blade or a willingness to lay down one's life.”\n-Chandra Malhotra, On Honour"

 R62_laws_of_ninun_title:0 "Laws of Ninun"
 R62_laws_of_ninun_desc:0 "Where there were petty warlords, now there is the Great Command. Where there was unrest, there is order. And where there were countless people aiming for little and achieving less, there will be the laws of Ninun: the education that makes a man, the examinations that proves their martial and cultural suitability, the rules that allow them to live as part of the Great Command."

 R62_warriors_of_the_kintonan_title:0 "Warriors of the Kintonan"
 R62_warriors_of_the_kintonan_desc:0 "“If you do not have spies, you can never know what is substantial or insubstantial concerning your enemy’s intention, you cannot succeed in invading a massive wall of numerous miles, or lead an entire enemy army into a trap and achieve a victory in every battle that you encounter.\n\n“Is there anything else which enables a single person to ruin a force of countless people? Only the way of a ninja.”\n\n-Fujibayashi Ken, a Kintonan scholar, in his introduction to a work describing the unique practices of some Kintonan soldiers."

 R62_wuhyun_kikun_title:0 "Wuhyun Kikun"
 R62_wuhyun_kikun_desc:0 "“You have served with honour. You have served with discipline. You have served with talent and skill. It has not gone unrecognized: For the first time in generations, the War Room has approved a new class of Kikun. Tomorrow, recruitment begins for the first Wuhyun Kikun.”\n\n-The Grand Marshal, speaking before assembled Wuhyun soldiers."

 R62_the_burden_of_empire_title:0 "The Burden of Empire"
 R62_the_burden_of_empire_desc:0 "Humble roots cannot hope to anchor a tree of stone, not one such as this. The drums of war beat ever on, a rhythmic symphony of blood strewn upon the fields below. Bands of our warriors race ‘cross the face of Rahen, the three Commands an iron will behind them.\n\nNever have our people been such a sight to behold, yet with that glory comes a great price. These shoulders grow weary, and only the tribes may lift the weight off of them. But can the three Commands truly manage such a feat?"

 R62_the_act_of_division_title:0 "The Act of Division"
 R62_the_act_of_division_desc:0 "For decades the tribes have fallen into place, naturally filling roles to create a grand organic tapestry. It is beautiful in its efficiency and structure. Hobgoblins possess a great unity of purpose, allowing us to reach above our station in the name of progress. This arrangement has brought [Root.GetName] to prosperity, but this progress is based on a delicate balance. Should the unity of the tribes grow stressed beyond limit, only naught but utter disaster could follow. The time has come to formally divide the rights of administration and purpose between the Commands, transitioning this great nation to one of modern governance."

 R62_the_tiger_command_title:0 "The Tiger Command"
 R62_the_tiger_command_desc:0 "When we first reached into the outside light to take our rightful place in Rahen and beyond, we encountered the wise Harimari and their human subjects, however, it quickly became clear that the great wisdom of the Harimari had also made them complacent, decadent and arrogant. If we are to rule without falling into decline like the Harimraj has, then we should not just copy their teachings and ways of administration, but also make sure to learn from the mistakes they made. This shall be the task of our newest administrative division -- the Tiger Command.\n\nBy focusing on the administration and education of both our own kind and our human subjects, the Tiger Command will make sure we do not falter in our march, and that every single citizen is instilled with the values of discipline and order. They shall bring us the worthy administrators and commanders our nation needs, so that our campaigns never fail."

 R62_cursed_temples_desc:0 "In our campaigns, we have conquered lush farmland, bustling city, imposing fortress. But the High Temples which dot the land are unlike anything else, and following our conquest our administrators report strange happenings in their vicinity. Perhaps the Oni, with all their knowledge, may have an idea of what is happening here -- and if so, our continued security demands their prompt assistance."

 R62_prepare_new_stewards_title:0 "Prepare New Stewards"
 R62_prepare_new_stewards_desc:0 "Once we leave the Jade Mines behind us we need someone else to govern it for us. But whoever this might be, they need to know all about our ancestral homes, the tunnels and caverns that have sheltered us for ages upon ages.\n\nIt is time to find promising candidates and prepare them to become our Stewards."

 R62_warbringer_peacemaker_title:0 "Warbringer Peacemaker"
 R62_warbringer_peacemaker_desc:0 "With the tensions between our goblin slave states abating, it is time to formally and properly end their rivalry and prepare them for the future: A future where they will govern the Jade Mines. Let us bind them together through marriage."

 R62_the_jade_march_title:0 "The Jade March"
 R62_the_jade_march_desc:0 "With the Jade Mines emptying, we leave behind a lot of land, it is time for Blackstep and Stolen Gem to move in. But in order to properly govern it, we must unite them into one country, a march that will administer the Jade Mines in our name: The Jade March."

 R62_deep_mithril_mining_title:0 "Deep Mithril Mining"
 R62_deep_mithril_mining_desc:0 "Mithril, though known to us for centuries, has always been difficult to amass due to its rarity, often available to only the strongest (and richest) of Marshals. However, in the newly consolidated Jademarch, the goblins -- natural diggers -- have presented an opportunity to us.\n\nWith enough resources, the goblins could do a deep dig for mithril veins, hopefully sufficient to secure vast quantities -- or at least, enough to ensure our best troops wield mithril weapons, making our forces even more devastating and our advance even more unstoppable."

 R62_the_mithril_forge_title:0 "The Mithril Forge"
 R62_the_mithril_forge_desc:0 "With the goblins continuing their mithril mining operations, we have now secured not only a steady, but a plentiful supply of mithril. Beyond our existing foundries in Sarilaavhan, we have the possibility to make a new forge, one entirely dedicated to making mithril armaments.\n\nThough the amount of mithril needed to supply this forge would be ludicrous, with enough resources, and goblins, anything should be possible."

 R62_misty_drills_title:0 "Misty Drills"
 R62_misty_drills_desc:0 "The martial temples of the Xia spent centuries developing their techniques. They fell to us in a handful of years. Let us repurpose the hundreds of mist-shrouded temples left in our wake to not teach failed philosophies, but to teach the ways of The Great Command."

 R62_the_nature_of_chi_title:0 "The Nature of Chi"
 R62_the_nature_of_chi_desc:0 "We lost more than one band of Nosunin to mysterious forces before we understood we were faced with something new: chi. Our generals treated the Xia’s warriors as if they were magic users, and yet… It isn’t quite the same sort of magic that shamans and others have used, either. It’s a peculiar sort of power, but it is also one that we must make a decision on, and sooner, rather than later."

 R62_guards_of_the_ikaniwagain_title:0 "Guards of the Ikaniwagain"
 R62_guards_of_the_ikaniwagain_desc:0 "“The Ashigaru are cheaply equipped. Armour of metal plates sewn on a cloth backing, easy to produce and to transport. A sword, a spear, sturdy enough. A conical helm completes their apparel. And a long matchlock gun, combined with constant training and a discipline to rival our own, makes them deadly on the battlefield.”\n\n-Grand Marshal of the Dragon Command, reporting on the Ikaniwagain ‘Ashigaru’ to the War Room."

 R62_spread_garrisons_title:0 "Spread Garrisons"
 R62_spread_garrisons_desc:0 "An empire remains a facade in the absence of its people. Though great in number, the hobgoblins are absent from the majority of our land, with humans and harimari representing the majorities in newly acquired territory.\n\nOnly those of true hobgoblin blood may be trusted with the defense of the empire against growing odds, and it is the duty of the Commands to send forth a vanguard of veterans with the promise of new lands to settle and defend. "

 R62_the_great_warcamps_title:0 "The Great Warcamps"
 R62_the_great_warcamps_desc:0 "Administering an empire requires more than simple magistrates and bureaucrats. Land won by force must be kept by force, a lesson we learned all too well in Sir. To prevent such an event from occurring yet again, a constant military presence must be maintained, both for the purpose of governance and conquest.\n\nGreat warcamps shall be established across the fields of Haless to truly cement our presence as rulers rather than occupiers, and to facilitate renewed campaigns east."

 R62_the_elephant_command_title:0 "The Elephant Command"
 R62_the_elephant_command_desc:0 "Beyond the caves and beneath the skies are countless animals, beasts, and monstrosities the likes of which are new to our people. Perhaps seated above them all in terms of raw power, however, is the elephant. A lumbering majesty capable of handling burdens far greater than mere oxen can bear, elephants are the missing piece of the logistical puzzle we found ourselves struggling to solve amidst the unceasing campaigns. We shall shoulder this notion and found the newest division in the command structure -- The Elephant Command.\n\nSeparate from the established triarchy, the Elephant Command’s duty revolves around the construction, fortification, and the transportation of raw materials for processing or for use by the Sunyanin. The very walls that stand between savagery and civilization will be the product of the elephants, and the foundries of the Command will be staffed by the greatest minds they have to offer. In time, the Elephant Command shall become the bulwark that anchors these great lands to the plains of Haless."

 R62_korashi_imports_desc:0 "For centuries, we hobgoblins have struggled to control the shamans that live among us, self-serving creatures commonly known as “mages” by other countries. The strategy that we’ve employed until just recently has been to mutilate or just simply execute shamans, ridding ourselves of their chaotic influence but also eliminating any possibility of using their power for ourselves.\n\nHowever, the Oni of Azjakuma have lately been supplying us with what they call “korashi”, a rare material with the ability to neutralize magic’s effects. Using chains of this korashi, we have been able to bind shamans and inhibit their powers, only allowing them to use their magic in the capacity of living weapons during battle. Unfortunately, as the Command expands, the amount of shamans within our territory increases rapidly, while the amount of korashi we control… does not. Thankfully, the Oni are willing to increase exports of korashi to us in exchange for protection. Such an arrangement should be formalized quickly, before there are more shamans in the Command than there is korashi."

 R62_a_question_of_allegiance_title:0 "A Question of Allegiance"
 R62_a_question_of_allegiance_desc:0 "The Oni of Azjakuma have been fine allies thus far, a secure flank and useful supports as we push into Haless. However... The Command does not truly have allies. It has enemies, and it has subordinates. Azjakuma must now decide which of those it wishes to be."

But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would see, know the strict organization that governs every body in this vast plain. The Nosuinin, lead by two of the infantry's lieutenant-generals, with six divisions each. Four regiments per division, four banners per regiment, eight bands per banner and three teams per band. Ten soldiers in a team, all of whom hope to one day rise and command one of those grouping themselves.\n\nOn the flanks, the Gikunin cavalry: three worg-riding clans, elite in their respective Commands and given the massive wolves to train and ride. Some say the Worg-Lieutenants and Crested Riders who serve as subordinates here are nigh-bestial themselves, but such voices are few and far between -- their charges tend not to leave survivors.\n\nThis is the Hobgoblin army.

Instead, we’ll settle for binding every single last shaman in Rahen. Anybody who uses magic in Rahen from now on will only do so as a walking weapon or as a living tool for the Great Command.

As such, the Marshal was deep in thought as he and his honour guard marched back to [Root.Capital.GetName], scarcely seeing the scenery as he thought of strategy and tactics.\n\nAnd then, as their march took them through a small valley, they were ambushed. A human voice yelled a warning, but the Marshal's retinue scarcely had time to draw their blades before the rebels were upon them. Though their foes were disorganized and poorly-armed, they also outnumbered the Marshal's men at least three-to-one.\n\nThe Marshal slew one rebel, and then another, and then another, but even so he saw his guards fall around him.

The two great campaigns that crushed the Xia saw countless of the temples’ soldiers slain, but most of the buildings themselves still stand.

On one hand, chi produces effects rather akin to magic, and a master of chi can be just as destructive as any rampaging shaman. On the other hand, the usage of chi requires a degree of discipline and self-control - qualities that most magic-users lack, but that the Command greatly respects. Additionally, there have - as of yet, anyways - been no reports of chi users making pacts with demons or devils, unlike what shamans have been wont to do.\n\nAs the Marshals see it, there are three paths available for the Command with regards to chi. Firstly, we can outlaw it in the same manner as they have with magic, though this would surely upset the chi users of the Xia. Secondly, we can leave it alone and allow chi users to function as before, though only time will tell what thousands of chi users in conquered territory might result in. Finally, the Command could attempt to integrate chi users and chi techniques as a whole into our military; while this would no doubt significantly increase our combat capabilities, there is also no doubt that reactionary forces within the Command would protest - perhaps violently - against what they see as just even more magic-users entering battle ranks.\n\nWhatever decision we come to, we must come to it now."

Just like you would melt down and combine scraps of old iron into a strong new sword, they say, so too should their clans be united.\n\nAlternatively, we could also send the many orphanages of war to these wounded clans for them to be adopted, giving them the structure of a Band to grow up and train in. This is a practice which is not unheard of already, but could be expanded and formalized, allowing the clans a new generation to replace those lost on the battlefield."

They have kneeled before us once more, yet their tongues have not stopped moving it seems.\n\nA group of formerly rebellious Command generals, know as the "Tughayasa Marshals", have come forward to us with a petition that they wrote when it became clear that their insubordination was doomed. They claim to have done this in complete secret and without their superiors' knowledge, seeing it as best for the Great Command (and their own lives, of course).\n\nThey propose the following: The Dragon, Tiger and Elephant commands will swear an oath of eternal loyalty and subordination to the Great Command in exchange for entrance into the War Room as equals. They cite that their expertise, manpower and production are indispensable and that all with treachery in their hearts have been killed on the battlefield.

When storming the temples our Ten (regiments) were sure to set every monk in korashi chains before securing the complex. Now that every treasure is accounted for and every monk is in chains the fate of the oracles is in the hands of the Command.\n\nThe oracles may not be adept with magic as we know it, but all have experienced with divination, and they possess a worrisome amount of influence across haless, hardline factions are demanding that the oracles be executed and the temple of Mount Tughayasa be looted and burned to the ground. While this would project our strength and strike fear into the hearts of any who dare meddle with the arcane and those who rely on them, it may be wasting a tool that can serve the Command.\n\nNow that we have an abundance of the korashi chains imported from the oni, it is also possible to keep the oracles in chains and have them only use their powers of prophecy in service to the Great Command. The oracular order could be made into an intelligence gathering apparatus that could give us a tactical and informational advantage over our enemies, but doing so may anger the traditional elements of hobgoblin society.\n\nThe ultimate decision, as always, lies with the Grand Marshal."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] gestured her to speak, and she said in a rush, "My Raja, Pordhatti is fallen! Tilthagar is fallen! The hobgoblins march onwards into the Harimraj".\n\nThe room erupted into chaos, ministers questioning how these monsters could defeat the great defenders of the Raj, bureaucrats debating who the next senaptia to replace them should be, representatives of the prabhi fretting over the fate of their realms. News spread like a wildfire, and questions and discussion devolved into shifting blame and bickering across the capital. The ministers blamed the upper castes for slacking on their military duties, while the upper caste blamed the ministers for not delegating enough resources to the military. The middle castes were condemned for greedily keeping their coin to themselves instead of supporting the Raj, while the middle castes claimed that the ministers and the upper castes had failed to protect them. While no one directly blamed the Raja, there were certainly looks that suggested they thought [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] unworthy as both ruler and protector of the Raj.\n\nAt the end of what felt like the longest day of the Raja’s reign, the Lotus Court dispersed for the day with little to show for it but soured moods. Unfortunately chaos within the court swiftly spread throughout the various realms of the Raj, further fracturing an already loosely governed realm. Some realms seek to use the chaos to consolidate their position within the Raj, others seek the protection of countries outside the Raj in the face of the threat of the Command, some even consider submitting to avoid the destruction that may come to their lands and people.\n\nDoes this mark the beginning of the end for the Raj?
