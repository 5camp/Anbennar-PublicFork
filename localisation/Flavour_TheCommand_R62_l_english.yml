#  R62_serpentsbloom_rations_desc:0 "Deep in the hobgoblin ancestral memory are the days when we were forced to the Serpentspine's fringes, when we starved and died in the dark. When we took the Jade Mines from the dwarves, that changed -- the bioluminescent fungus known as Serpentbloom, abundant in cavern and road, provides all the nutrition a growing hobgoblin could require. \n\nTended to and prepared by slaves, it serves as our soldiers' primary means of supply. But as our military grows, so too must the Serpentbloom farms. The slaves will work, the crops will grow, and so the armies will march."

#  R62_control_the_zanyu_kinunin_desc:0 "The orcs are simpleminded, yet a resilient, rowdy and stubborn race, making them effective slaves, yet, hard to control. Though these challenges are difficult, through a process of token reward, large amounts of movement, and enough discipline, even the toughest of orcs can be made to bend the knee.\n\nWith these new practices, no orc shall ever see freedom, it is their duty as a race to serve, and to obey The Command, for even the dumbest orc knows they are nothing without their master."

#  R62_blades_and_spades_title:0 "Blades and Spades"
#  R62_blades_and_spades_desc:0 "The orcs are fearsome warriors, as shown by large amounts of strength and an almost indomitable will. These traits, though applied well in the field of battle, are also able to be applied very effectively in our farms.\n\nWith our dispersal of the orcish race across Rahen, we’ve seen a large amount of increased output of crops among our farms with orc slaves. The effectiveness of these orcish yields across our land has been astonishing, and with this, we shall now continue this trend of orcish farmers and labourers in our domain.\n\nLet the orc not just toil in the field of battle, but also in the field of grain and rice."

#  R62_tempered_rage_title:0 "Tempered Rage"
#  R62_tempered_rage_desc:0 "Through our widespread practices of orcish slavery and disperal of their race across Rahen, a new kind of race, one from the intermingling of humans and orcs, has popped up. Due to them possessing orc blood, they are still fairly disorganized and easy for us to subdue. But, because they are still smarter than the average orc, they are perfect for more complex but menial production and administrative tasks. We shall continue observing the half-orcs, for they have been quite the asset."

#  R62_honourable_half_orcs_title:0 "Honourable Half Orcs"
#  R62_honourable_half_orcs_desc:0 "With the increasing numbers of half-orcs across our lands, especially in our Ninun enforced areas, they’ve seen a new identity, instead of being seen as bastards and outcasts, they are now seen as hard working craftsmen, dedicated to a sense of honor. With this new reputation, the half-orcs have now gained a much more honorable place among the human Wuhyun societies. With this new reputation, many more half-orcs have popped up across our domain, and even half-orc majorities in a few places have been seen. We should continue to encourage this reputation across our domain, for an honorable craftsman is a loyal craftsman."

#  R62_korashi_imports_desc:0 "For centuries, we hobgoblins have struggled to control the shamans that live among us, self-serving creatures commonly known as “mages” by other countries. The strategy that we’ve employed until just recently has been to mutilate or just simply execute shamans, ridding ourselves of their chaotic influence but also eliminating any possibility of using their power for ourselves.\n\nHowever, the oni of Azjakuma have lately been supplying us with what they call “korashi”, a rare material with the ability to neutralize magic’s effects. Using chains of this korashi, we have been able to bind shamans and inhibit their powers, only allowing them to use their magic in the capacity of living weapons during battle. Unfortunately, as the Command expands, the amount of shamans within our territory increases rapidly, while the amount of korashi we control… does not. Thankfully, the oni of Azjakuma are willing to increase exports of korashi to us in exchange for protection. Such an arrangement should be formalized quickly, before there are more shamans in the Command than there is korashi."

Dedicated training halls for warriors of varying backgrounds and strategies populate the towns and cities, and every village is guarded by some militarized force. Knowledge on these fighting techniques is fragmented and sourced mostly from northern infiltrations, but there no doubt could be an endless amount of these strategies capable of catching our troops off-guard from villages uncountable.\n\nWith present knowledge, we estimate that these Xia states can field around two to three Kikun, a force as numerous as our own.

Information presented is based on first-hand accounts of commanders and surviving frontline soldiers.\n\nThe Xia forces crashed upon our frontlines, pursuing combat with our troops with a supernatural fervor, those that were isolated into one-on-one combat were made into corpses. Our forces adapted quickly enough upon order from local commanders, ensuring that no deviation from an inter-locked shield wall was allowed, as our worgs and boar riders harried them with advances too quick to effectively counter.\n\nThe result was a victory, among the largest of the campaigns.

Still, it appears that this nominal control is enough to bind its subjects to protect the ruler upon a war's declaration. Every last one of them, all pledged to defend the ruler of the Xia - and in turn, the land itself - to the last man.\n\nThis report puts forward a request to cease preparations and begin the campaign immediately. Based on present information, their forces can converge and unify within a matter of days. If we are to ensure a quick and decisive victory, we must act before the commander of the Xia can muster its splintered manpower into a united force capable of rivaling ours."

For too long have our troops met their end at an untimely matter, clashing head-to-head with a force neither guns nor steel can banish... so far.\n\nWe have identified sources of this mist, its properties derived from local legendary sites. Artificers under our employ, whose names and achievements can be seen in the attached parchment, have identified certain solutions for this ethereal menace, which we may be rid ourselves of with decisive action and a hefty sum to compensate these individuals. The northern Oni have also volunteered themselves to banish this mist with a degree of malevolent fervor, not that it concerns us what their reason may be, just that it be done as soon as possible."

One thing can be said for sure, however, and that is that these monks did not live as modestly as they claimed.

Moreover, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the region was politically divided, leaving the path to conquest wide open. Thus, in 1507, the Command invaded Pordhatti in its first thrust into Dhujat."

Moreover, it may be possible to weaponize their esoteric knowledge to secure more victories in the future.

As such, we shall invest five Yuyuanin within Sarisung as a rapid reaction force ever-ready to quash rebellions and uprisings against our rule."

# #  the_command.0.d:0 "The humans feared. Creatures in the dark, angry spirits in the night. And, when they looked to the looming Serpentspine, they feared an unending tide of savage monsters, the stuff of exiled dwarves' tales. The hobgoblins tribes who lived in the foothills were a pest and a nuisance, but merely that. They feared the wrong thing.\n\nThat is obvious as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] surveys the armies assembled before him in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Off to one side lay the Ninyu Kikun, the High Marshal's elite; on the other, the slave state rabble of the Zanyu Kikunin. Standing before him, straight in salute, the Wolf Marshal, the Lion Marshal, the Boar Marshal, their armies behind them.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] holds their eyes for a second, then two then three, before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze moves on, drawn to the massive banners of looted silk, each marshal's subordinate generals accompanied by a standard-bearer.\n\nBeyond that, bodies seem to blur together. But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would see, know the strict organization that governs every body in this vast plain. The Nosuinin, lead by two of the infantry's lieutenant-generals, with six divisions each. Four regiments per division, four banners per regiment, eight bands per banner and three teams per band. Ten soldiers in a team, all of whom hope to one day rise and command one of those grouping themselves.\n\nOn the flanks, the Gikunin cavalry: three worg-riding clans, elite in their respective Commands and given the massive wolves to train and ride. Some say the Worg-Lieutenants and Crested Riders who serve as subordinates here are nigh-bestial themselves, but such voices are few and far between -- their charges tend not to leave survivors.\n\nThis is the Hobgoblin army. This is the Great Command. This is what Haless, Halann, will soon learn to fear."

Instead, the loyal soldiers of the Command display only stoic resolve as they ready for their task. None of them will enjoy it, but done for the Command, it will be a chore, like any other.\n\n”You hobgoblin scum! First you demand the subservience of we great and powerful oni, and now this is how you treat us?!” The giant spits at one of the hobgoblins, but the latter does not even flinch as it hits him in the face. “Is this how you treat your allies?! Is this how you repay your loyal servants?! By torturing them?! Even goblins have more honor than you!”\n\nThe interrogator approaches the oni, wheeling over his cart of tools. “Loyal servants answer their masters when questioned.” Bulky hobgoblin fingers delicately trace over the torture instruments as they search for one to start with. “If you had simply told us how to produce our own korashi chains, this would not have happened.” The hobgoblin picks up a pair of pliers, opening and closing them as he tests the grip. “And now, you will see what happens when a slave is disobedient.”\n\nAs the interrogator approaches the oni with the tool, the giantkin mentally prepares himself for the coming hours. He believes wholeheartedly that he will not break to the torturers of the Command. He believes wholeheartedly that he will keep the secrets of the oni of the Azjakuma. He believes those things and more, and he may believe them all as much as he wishes, but it will not change one simple fact: Nobody disobeys the Command.\n\nThe oni breaks within the hour."

#  the_command.6.desc:0 "Long ago, before even the Day of Ashen Skies, the shamans betrayed the hobgoblins. Claiming to be concerned that our people were turning away from superstitious beliefs in otherworldly powers, the foul shamans began to consort with demons and sell their souls in order to gain enough power to take back control over hobgoblin society. However, they instead nearly destroyed the entire hobgoblin race altogether in their foolish, short-sighted endeavor.\n\nSince then, hobgoblins have never once trusted magic-users. Once, we even killed every person with even the slightest trace of magical ability, no matter who they were. Too much work has gone into creating our Great Command, and never would we allow a selfish, conceited magic-user to ruin it.\n\nHowever, recent years have brought great developments to the way that we handle the shamans that live among us. The Oni granted us the secrets of korashi, and now there are now enough chains of the anti-magic material in our possession to bind the whole of Halann, if we had the mind to. Instead, we’ll settle for binding every single last shaman in Rahen. Anybody who uses magic in Rahen from now on will only do so as a walking weapon or as a living tool for the Great Command. In that way, at least, those monstrous creatures can serve the greater good, rather than their own narcissistic desires.\n\nIn the end, even the perpetually egocentric shamans will learn the eternal lesson: It is better to die for the Command, than to live for yourself."

#  the_command.33.desc:0 "The Command has outlawed magic except under the direct supervision of commanding officers. That much is well-known and well-established.\n\nWhat isn’t well-known or well-established, however, is where the ‘chi’ of the Xia falls in terms of that issue. On one hand, chi produces effects rather akin to magic, and a master of chi can be just as destructive as any rampaging shaman. On the other hand, the usage of chi requires a degree of discipline and self-control - qualities that most magic-users lack, but that the Command greatly respects. Additionally, there have - as of yet, anyways - been no reports of chi users making pacts with demons or devils, unlike what shamans have been wont to do.\n\nAs the Marshals see it, there are three paths available for the Command with regards to chi. Firstly, we can outlaw it in the same manner as they have with magic, though this would surely upset the chi users of the Xia. Secondly, we can leave it alone and allow chi users to function as before, though only time will tell what thousands of chi users in conquered territory might result in. Finally, the Command could attempt to integrate chi users and chi techniques as a whole into our military; while this would no doubt significantly increase our combat capabilities, there is also no doubt that reactionary forces within the Command would protest - perhaps violently - against what they see as just even more magic-users entering battle ranks.\n\nWhatever decision we come to, we must come to it now."
