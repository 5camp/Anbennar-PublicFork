 sarhalevents.3.d:0 "The time of the 333rd Empire is close at hand. The naga chose Sykar Riverclaw of Rayaz to be the Sovereign who will lead the lizardfolk in this new age. Such an arrangement is laughable. He has had every victory handed to his nation on a silver platter. Meanwhile we are the ones who took the great city of Karrask against all odds. We have proven our worth.\n\nIt’s time to end this farce. Send a delegation to Rayaz. This alliance is over. From this point on, we are enemies. We will not rest until they have been crushed. We are the ones who will lead the lizardfolk into the dawn of its greatest era!"

 sarhalevents.4.t:0 "Betrayal"
 sarhalevents.4.d:0 "To think it started with delight. As news spread to Rayaz of the capture of Karrask by Asarta forces, a celebration was planned coinciding with the expected arrival of a delegation from Asarta in the capital. The families would convene, share a feast, and discuss plans for the future ruling of lizardfolk.\n\nInstead they brought only news of betrayal. Asarta has stabbed the alliance through the heart and announced that they will not rest until Rayaz has fallen. No war has been declared, but from this point on they are naught but sworn enemies. No 333rd Empire can be formed as long as the other still stands."
