#Frogarsalforn, library of the ancients
 dd_frogarsalforn: "Frôgarsalforn"
 diggy_dungeons.100.t:0 "A Hidden Library?"
 diggy_dungeons.100.d:0 "Our populace celebrates the return of our most recent expedition. They are being heralded as heroes and given a proper, heroic welcome. But behind closed doors, far away from the ears of the common people, the expedition leader tells our administration something else, something more.\n\nDuring the expedition they have uncovered more than just trinkets and treasures: A crack in the wall has led them to a room with old books and strange runes. All of dwarvish make.\n\nAfter some research, the council has decided what this must be: A remnant structure from the old days of Aul-Dwarov, a library where the ancient dwarves have accumulated their knowledge."
 diggy_dungeons.100.a:0 "It is Frôgarsalforn, the Ancient Library"

 diggy_dungeons.101.t:0 "Frôgarsalforn: The Ancient Library\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.101.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rubbled walls and falling stones give way to an old entrance room, overshadowed by its ancient air. Dust has settled on the old dwarven walls, their inscriptions hidden beneath a grey mass illuminated by faint torches. Slowly the expedition steps into these halls of antiquity, tiny bones crumble under the heavily armoured soldiers' boots.\n\n''This is the place,” a sage explains. “This is Frôgarsalforn!”\n\nHe walks into the centre of the room, where the broken pieces of an orrery lie scattered across the floor. The base is covered in sticky webs of arachnid origin. These strands also extend beyond the room, covering up faint exits to the side. The grandest door, however, is not covered in webs, instead, it stands slightly ajar… "
 diggy_dungeons.101.a:0 "Clear the webs"
 diggy_dungeons.101.b:0 "Open the door"

 diggy_dungeons.102.t:0 "A Trove\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.102.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The passages with webs were cleared with no problems, the silvery-white strands now an amorphous mass on the ground. Hidden behind these once-homes lies the nest and breeding ground of the spiders. Gleaming among the remnants are old coins, gold and silver, as well as trinkets of dwarvish make, amulets and other, more exotic goods."
 diggy_dungeons.102.a:0 "Loot the webs"

 diggy_dungeons.103.t:0 "The Many-Legged Menace\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.103.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the webs jitter, their reverberations send signals to those who made them in the first place. From the passages spew forth the eight-legged monstrosities who now claim these hallways their home.\n\nAxe and blade against leg and mandible, the sudden fight overwhelmed the soldiers. Quickly they threw open the big door, hoping to find a safe haven deeper in the ancient structure."
 diggy_dungeons.103.a:0 "Get away!"

 diggy_dungeons.104.t:0 "The Reading Hall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.104.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rows upon rows of bookstands designate this room as the old reading hall of the library. It is not hard to imagine the dwarves of yore pondering their scrolls and stone tablets. In the centre of the room stands an effigy of erudition, a grand statue of a dwarf, book and scroll in his hands. The stone base is carved with runes.\n\n“All those who seek knowledge must know the ways to obtain it.”\n\n“A classic dwarven riddle,” one of the soldiers says. “It must have an answer hidden in this room.”\n\nThe explorers dispersed immediately, looking through the old rafters for clues. Eventually, an elder adventurer steps forth. “A library is a key to knowledge. What must we do to use a key? We must turn the pedestal!” he says.\n\nOthers seem more suspicious of his theory. They claim that turning over the statue itself might be the better idea."
 diggy_dungeons.104.a:0 "Turn it over - down with the statue"
 diggy_dungeons.104.b:0 "Turn the pedestal"

 diggy_dungeons.105.t:0 "The Key To Knowledge\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.105.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With rope and strength the statue keeled over, breaking loose from the base. As it fell to the ground, snapping noises echo through the room, followed by a low rumbling sound. The mechanism inside the statue had broken down, releasing the winch that held the hidden door in place.\n\nThe sound of bursting stone mixed with the creaking of stone sliding on stone as a door further into the library opened. Within the rubble, however, the explorers also found  some well-hidden gold. A thoroughly successful undertaking!"
 diggy_dungeons.105.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After considerable angular momentum was laid upon the statue it finally began to turn. Stone sliding on stone, groaning grains of particulate like flour seeping out of the joint, the mechanism inside the apparatus whirred to life. From within came the sound of a winch unwinding.\n\nSuddenly a hidden door on the other end of the room opened, effortlessly sliding open. In addition to that, a secret compartment within the statue itself opened, filled with gold."
 diggy_dungeons.105.a:0 "Good job, let's continue"

 diggy_dungeons.106.t:0 "Statue of Secrets\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.106.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As soon as the soldiers touched the statue it sprang to life, leaving its pedestal. It wielded the scroll akin to a sword, the book like a shield.\n\nThe soldiers were startled at first but caught themselves soon enough to mount a defence. The stone was old, however, and could not take much. The animated statue soon crumbled, but the magic power within burst in an arcane explosion, sending our forces  flying backwards."
 diggy_dungeons.106.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As soon as the soldiers touched the statue it sprang to life, leaving its pedestal.

 diggy_dungeons.107.t:0 "At Knowledge's Core\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.107.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Now the expedition enters the main library. High arches bend in strange ways, fractals invoking a strange feeling of familiarity in the soldiers. The fluted ceiling reaches up far above, with rows and rows of bookshelves lining the ascent.\n\nMost of the exits from this room have long been buried under the ages, but two hallways are still passable. To one side lies the old bookbinder's workshop, while the other leads to the paper mill. It is now up to the expedition leader to decide where to go next."
 diggy_dungeons.107.a:0 "To the bookbinder"
 diggy_dungeons.107.b:0 "We should try the papermill"

 diggy_dungeons.108.t:0 "Milling Goblins\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.108.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The paper mill is dominated by the gigantic axle emerging from the water wheelworks beyond the stone. Attached to it are the hammers that used to stomp on linen and rags to make the pulp that would eventually become paper.\n\nThey no longer work, instead, they are infested with a band of goblins that live in every nook and cranny of this manufactory. As soon as our soldiers entered the room the monsters descended upon them, claw, teeth and shoddy blades against our superior armaments."
 diggy_dungeons.108.a:0 "We'll show them!"

 diggy_dungeons.109.t:0 "Binder's Folly\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.109.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The bookbinder's rooms are small and cramped, with many strange turns around the furniture. It does not help that every nook and cranny seems to be stuffed with a group of orcs that have made their home here.\n\nFighting starts breaking out the moment one of our men enters the room. The orcish ferocity strikes fear into our soldiers, but they fight bravely. For now…"
 diggy_dungeons.109.a:0 "Give them no quarter!"

 diggy_dungeons.110.t:0 "Battered and Beaten\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.110.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins overwhelmed us by sheer number alone. Like a hydra, if you cut one goblin down, two are ready to take its place. Slowly we were driven back into the corners of the room, some unlucky groups circled in. Screams and warcries intermingle as both sides take losses, but it is our side who takes the brunt, and casualties mount."
 diggy_dungeons.110.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The orcs plough through our ranks, weaponizing the old tools of the trade against us. They throw the discarded equipment and turn over tables, all in their devastating offensive. Soon the front is littered with corpses. There are more of our men lying there than orcs, however, and those brutish specimens still have much fighting spirit left."
 diggy_dungeons.110.a:0 "We need to salvage this"

 diggy_dungeons.111.t:0 "Victory!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.111.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins posed no great threat, their weapons too weak to harm our armour. Soon they fled through the cracks, leaving the room to us."
 diggy_dungeons.111.d.2:0 "Despite their ferocious nature the orcs were unable to keep up their offensive, and before they could organize themselves we had already cut down a majority. The rest fled the halls, nowhere to be seen."
 diggy_dungeons.111.a:0 "Onwards!"

 diggy_dungeons.112.t:0 "Emergency System\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.112.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Old dwarven structures like these, located far away from other infrastructure, usually had automated defence mechanisms to repel invaders. During the disastrous battle, one such mechanism was discovered: An emergency offensive measure. But centuries have passed since its last maintenance. Will it still work?"
 diggy_dungeons.112.a:0 "It is our last option"
 diggy_dungeons.112.b:0 "We shouldn't risk it"

 diggy_dungeons.113.t:0 "The Return\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.113.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]When the first soldiers arrive back in the main room, they are startled by what they see. Our fighting must have alerted more and more enemies who now swarm the premises. All parts of the room are filled with our foes, all entrances blocked. We only have one choice left: Fight once again for our lives."
 diggy_dungeons.113.a:0 "One last stand"

 diggy_dungeons.114.t:0 "Aid of Yore\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.114.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The emergency system sprang to life, disgorging dwarven security automata upon our enemies. The whirling constructs cut deep swathes into our enemies and obliterated them, leaving us free reign over the region."
 diggy_dungeons.114.a:0 "Those dwarves knew what was up"

 diggy_dungeons.115.t:0 "Backfire\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.115.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The system was working -- but in the worst way possible. The automatons attacked everything in sight, even our men, reducing the entire room to rubble.\n\nSoon nothing was left except a single soldier that had been straggling behind, who now had the terrible task of reporting this failure to his superiors."
 diggy_dungeons.115.a:0 "What a terrible idea"

 diggy_dungeons.116.t:0 "Retreat\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.116.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Instead of risking the old dwarven mechanism, the expedition leader signalled a retreat. Quickly the troops gathered and made their way out of the library, leaving the rooms and treasures behind with heavy hearts.\n\nBack in the capital [Root.Monarch.GetName]was not impressed either but understood what had to be done. Now we tend to our wounded and plan for the next time."
 diggy_dungeons.116.a:0 "We'll try again next time"

 diggy_dungeons.117.t:0 "Corpses upon Corpses\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.117.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The last missive reaching the capital was that a fight had begun in the main hall. Then nothing. Diviners have tried to discern what had happened. Their result: Total annihilation. The expedition has failed."
 diggy_dungeons.117.a:0 "next time"

 diggy_dungeons.118.t:0 "Towards a Bright Future\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.118.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their superior numbers we have managed to kill enough of our enemies to scare them into fleeing. As the hall clears out we survey and try to salvage what we can. Many walls are now completely broken down, but that has also revealed more chambers that were previously inaccessible. There we found old records and treasure that were still mostly intact, a great success for our expedition!"
 diggy_dungeons.118.a:0 "Take what you can"

 diggy_dungeons.119.t:0 "Glorious Return\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.119.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition returns, treasure and knowledge in hand. They are heralded as heroes and share the tales of their experiences with the eager ears of our populace."
 diggy_dungeons.119.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 diggy_dungeons.120.t:0 "Beyond the Premises\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.120.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the main rooms of the library cleared out and in various states of repair, one of the construction crews reports of a break-in that revealed a zig-zagging chasm into the dark depths of the mountain. After some first inspections we were attacked by a small fighting force of goblins, armed with weapons of higher quality than initially expected. Quickly the defences were rallied so that construction would not be hindered.\n\nAfter some fighting the goblins were either killed or fled back into the dark, but the chasm clearly posed a serious security hazard. After much discussion the decision to send another expedition into the library was deemed reasonable, and a new force of explorers were sent out to brave its halls.\n\nArriving at the point of the break-in, the expedition leader reviews and takes stock of her men and  supplies. But even as this proceeded, screams could be heard from the dark below. Faint lights appeared in the depths, quickly drawing nearer. The soldiers readied their weapons against the approaching foe, readying a defense against a tunnel in the wall."
 diggy_dungeons.120.a:0 "We will stand united"

 diggy_dungeons.121.t:0 "The Sword is Stronger Than the Claw\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.121.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins arrived in manageable waves, trickling into the room in small groups. They were mostly disoriented and confused as to what exactly was happening. This meant that our soldiers had no trouble keeping the enemy at bay, although the waves got stronger towards the end. Then, as suddenly as they appeared, the goblins stopped coming through, leaving the path ahead clear."
 diggy_dungeons.121.a:0 "A great start to our endeavour"

 diggy_dungeons.122.t:0 "Broken Wall, Broken Shields\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.122.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins crashed through the hole in the wall in an unending tidal wave, goblin after goblin disgorging from the stone wound. Our soldiers were slowly and steadily driven back, each line of defence falling almost as soon as they were erected. Then, after a bloody back and forth, the goblins retreated back into the dark. The path is clear, but the price was high."
 diggy_dungeons.122.a:0 "Not the best start, but a start nonetheless"

 diggy_dungeons.123.t:0 "Gazing Into the Abyss\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.123.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The chasm stretches deep below, its yawning dark beckons those at the precipice. Some soldiers are uneasy already, mentioning some strange force numbing their senses.\n\nBut the expedition leader must determine how to best approach the chasm.\n\nQuickly two options stand out. The chasm has repeating platforms and terraces protruding from the walls, which could be secured and made walkable, adding safe waiting spots, but at a high cost to our supplies. The other possibility is to use winches from the library construction to rope the soldiers down one by one."
 diggy_dungeons.123.a:0 "Secure the platforms"
 diggy_dungeons.123.b:0 "Just rope down"

 diggy_dungeons.124.t:0 "The Way Down\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.124.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At first the plan with the ropes worked out. One by one the soldiers touched down on the floor of the chasm, but towards the end the winches began creaking under the constant strain, and the rope itself started degrading. Then, piece by piece, the mechanism broke, sending many men falling to their deaths, destroying supplies and other important equipment."
 diggy_dungeons.124.a:0 "It all comes crashing down"

 diggy_dungeons.125.t:0 "The Abyss Gazes Back\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.125.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The terraces proved to be too unstable to safely traverse. Rocks breaking loose left and right sent equipment flying into the unknown dark, with only the sound of shattering tools reaching us. Our pitons and ropes managed to catch our men, thankfully,  so that we did not lose any of our crew. Despite the havoc, we did  all reach steady ground again, able to go on."
 diggy_dungeons.125.a:0 "Salvage what we can and continue"

 diggy_dungeons.126.t:0 "Descension\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.126.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With pitons and rope, strong pickaxes and sturdy spikes we managed to get down through the chasm with no problem whatsoever. In fact our morale improved after that first encounter with the goblins. Songs were sung, it all felt more like a stroll through the mountain instead of a dangerous descent."
 diggy_dungeons.126.a:0 "The climbing gear was worth the money"

 diggy_dungeons.127.t:0 "The Horde\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.127.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Walking along the bottom of the chasm instilled a strange mood in the explorers. Often the scouts would see something in the pitch-black dark, only for it to be a false alarm. The sound of scurrying claws dragged across stone echoed through the walls. There was something in the dark, just no one knew where it was exactly.\n\nIt all happened so quickly. From one second to the other the goblins descended upon us. Flashing teeth and claws, discarded swords and broken shields in their hands, they attacked us before the scouts could sound the alarm."
 diggy_dungeons.127.a:0 "Fight for your lives!"

 diggy_dungeons.128.t:0 "Brought Low In the Dark\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.128.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their sudden appearance our soldiers quickly rallied around our banners. Fighting from those steady formations managed to repel most of the greenskins. Some managed to get through the defences nonetheless, but reinforcements from other parts of the battle could bolster the ranks again.\n\nAs the goblins lost their superiority in numbers they started retreating up the walls from whence they came. A quick survey of the damages showed that there had been some casualties, as expected, but overall the battle was a resounding victory."
 diggy_dungeons.128.a:0 "The path is clear"

 diggy_dungeons.129.t:0 "Decimation\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.129.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Just as quickly as it began it ended. After decimating our troops the goblins retreated into the dark again, seemingly content with what damage they had caused. Our medics now tend now to the wounded that can still be helped, and the surgeons patch up whatever they can. Many have fallen, far too many, but going back now is no option."
 diggy_dungeons.129.a:0 "We must go on"

 diggy_dungeons.130.t:0 "A Warband In the Deep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.130.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The past days had been quiet and fruitful. The cartographers managed to map out most of the lower levels, and our prospectors had even found some promising veins of ore, although nothing major.\n\nBut this soon changed with the echo of orcish war cries. The explorers knew immediately what would happen: A warband was roaming the chasm, and scouts soon reported that they were swiftly closing in . Our forces quickly took defensive positions, and just in time, as with unparalleled ferocity the orcs soon descended upon us."
 diggy_dungeons.130.a:0 "We will prevail"

 diggy_dungeons.131.t:0 "An Eventual Triumph\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.131.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their ferocious nature, the orcs turned out to be not quite as dangerous as we had believed. The winding paths in this chasm meant that they could not attack in a full frontal assault and had to trickle into the battlefield. In the end the drawn-out battle ended in our favour, with the warband dispatched and destroyed."
 diggy_dungeons.131.a:0 "Very good"

 diggy_dungeons.132.t:0 "Overrun\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.132.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Charging into our defences from the front and from the sides, through hidden tunnels in the walls, the orcs rushed over us like a wave, cutting down everyone and everything in their path. Terrified screams of pain could be heard echoing from the walls, the gurgling of blood, and war cries of orcs.\n\nDespite our losses, we gave as good as we got, and eventually destroyed the warband -- but at a staggering price."
 diggy_dungeons.132.a:0 "A costly victory, but a victory nonetheless"

 diggy_dungeons.133.t:0 "The Underboss\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.133.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Our expedition has arrived at the end of the chasm. Over the past days goblin presence has become stronger and stronger, with many skirmishes here and there.\n\nBut now they stand in front of a rackety wooden castle clearly brimming with goblins. Floor by floor they cut themselves through until they arrive at the central chambers. There a large goblin sits on a throne of bones, wearing a shoddy crown. The soldiers have not yet been noticed, and so there is the opportunity to defeat this monster with brains, not just with brawn."
 diggy_dungeons.133.a:0 "Make a trap"

 diggy_dungeons.134.t:0 "Incarceration\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.134.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The trap is set and the expedition waits in the shadows. Eventually, the Boss leans back in his throne when the rackety cage falls down on him. This was the sign for the soldiers to come in and attack their helpless foe. Soon, all that is left of the Boss is a corpse."
 diggy_dungeons.134.a:0 "May you rot down here"

 diggy_dungeons.135.t:0 "Unhidden\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.135.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]During the construction of the trap our troops were suddenly overwhelmed by a patrol of goblins who immediately sounded the alarm. Within seconds the Boss was alerted and threateningly flourished his club at us.\n\nHis face was filled with a strange mixture of hate and glee, his teeth yellow-red against his dark green skin. We must be defensive if we wish to survive this encounter."
 diggy_dungeons.135.a:0 "The best defence is a good offence! Charge!"

 diggy_dungeons.136.t:0 "Blood and Bile\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.136.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the end all it took was a single sword plunged deep into the Boss' throat. Like a fountain of fresh springwater, blood and bile spilled out of his body, his bloated skin sagging down into a puddle of fat."

 diggy_dungeons.137.t:0 "Terror in the Deep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.137.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Goblins pour out from the walls. The Boss' club quakes the earth. One by one our men are slain. In the end only I remain. I can still hear them searching for me. They get closer. I can see the fire of their torches. Here. They. Come."
 diggy_dungeons.137.a:0 "A terrible end"

 diggy_dungeons.138.t:0 "The Home Stretch\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.138.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the threat of the Boss dealt with we can declare the chasm to be safe again. As we return to the library, however, new ideas for security measures are being drafted. Most importantly: seal off the chasm. Soon construction workers put their strengths to use and start patching up the wall, hopefully without another problem…"

 diggy_dungeons.140.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Just as construction began on the wall, one last swarm of goblins came out from the chasm below. Their shrieking was made up from threats of vengeance and promises of death. They fought recklessly, until the very last one dropped dead.

 diggy_dungeons.141.a:0 "An excellent expedition!"

 diggy_dungeons.142.t:0 "A Deeper Vault?\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.142.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]For the past months, construction work had been going swimmingly and many parts of the library could be used by our scholars already. The workers laboured on their periphery, fixing things up here and there. Recently, however, some scribes have reported strange noises near one of the lower floors. The initial investigation had gone nowhere with the inspector saying nothing was there.\n\nComplaints did not end, however. Over the next weeks, more and more people complained about noises and even missing books. At this point, the chief librarian had heard enough. Clearly, something was amiss, and he called for a new expedition into the library.\n\nWith the force assembled the expedition leader took stock of the situation. Together with a few scouts he surveyed the perimeter and a particularly perceptive peer provoked peculiar proceedings: Behind one of the shelves could be heard the rattles of a door swinging in a draft. He pushed the shelf aside, revealing an entrance into a deeper part of the library. From the dark corridor, the sound of wood bumping against wood echoes out."
 diggy_dungeons.142.a:0 "Follow the sound"

 diggy_dungeons.143.t:0 "Collapsing Shelf\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.143.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition leader gathered the soldiers and headed into the corridor. The strange sound became louder and clearer as they entered a high-vaulted tunnel with ruined bookshelves left and right. Suddenly some of the shelves started falling in on each other, threatening to bury the expedition under books and splinters."
 diggy_dungeons.143.a:0 "Get away!"

 diggy_dungeons.144.t:0 "Broken Door\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.144.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The barricade, it turned out, was useless. Just as the soldiers had finished erecting it, the door  burst open, revealing a horde of goblins behind, rushing forward and clambering over the defenses."
 diggy_dungeons.144.a:0 "Great job, everyone…"

 diggy_dungeons.145.t:0 "Secure Passageway\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.145.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the door safely barricaded no one can get through, and the passage should be safe to any intruders. This means, however, that in order to follow up on the strange occurrences the expedition has to find another path.\n\nAfter some time one of the scouts returned with great news: she has found another way into the deeper library! Not only that but this path must have been dug by a xorn or a similarly creature with corvidian instincts: gems and gold were laid in hoard just a few minutes walk into the tunnel."
 diggy_dungeons.145.a:0 "What a fortunate find"

 diggy_dungeons.146.t:0 "Under Books\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.146.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The shelves cave in left and right, bending under their own weight. Each shelf, in turn, brings its neighbour to fall as well in a gigantic cascade of books and wood falling like boulders in an avalanche."

 diggy_dungeons.147.t:0 "Over Books\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.147.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In a strange fit of luck and skill the books did not harm any of our expedition. The shelves either stopped halfway from crashing down or got stopped by the shelf across the passage, forming a strange  roof-like structure. Some books did fall down, but by far not as threatening an event as the whole shelf would have been."

 diggy_dungeons.148.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins rushing out of the tunnel quickly met a bitter end on the tips of our spears and lances. Almost one by one they ran into our formation making this battle a piecemeal. In the end, a large pile of goblins lay in front of us. Shovelling them aside proved indeed to be the greater of the two challenges…"

 diggy_dungeons.149.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the force of a bomb goblins spilled out of the tunnel, completely overwhelming our troops. The crude weapons cut nasty wounds that went deep under the skin.\n\nAs our vanguard began to fall one of our commanders saw an opening in the goblin's assault. He signalled an almost orderly retreat forward into the Library, escaping the goblins with most of the men still alive."

 diggy_dungeons.150.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Orderly rows of desks stand side by side, the signs of age draped over them like soft cloth. Dust swirls up with every step the expedition takes. Ever so slowly books move in their shelves, first shifting and shuffling around, then hovering through the still air to accumulate into a large clump with vaguely humanoid features - limbs and something that could be considered a head, more a bump extruding from the main accumulation. Despite its almost peaceful formation, this monster -- book golem? --  now seems focused on ploughing through our troops, hurling streams of books towards us."

 diggy_dungeons.152.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With heavy shields it was no problem to guard against the flurry of books flying towards us.

 diggy_dungeons.153.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At first it felt very stupid, but volume by volume we exhausted the creature's bibliography.

 diggy_dungeons.154.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Like trolls trying to catch flies our soldiers aimlessly try to catch the books, failing miserably. Their clumsy jumps make them fall over while books keep on bashing them.\n\nEventually the creature seems to be exhausted, having buried most of our expedition under piles of books and dissipated. Slowly the soldiers wriggle out again. None had died, but they had been deeply demoralised."

 diggy_dungeons.155.t:0 "The Stash\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.155.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The room opening up now was more of a cave than a proper room akin to those we had encountered previously. Large limestone deposits hung menacingly above heaps and heaps of gold coins, minted all those ages ago in Aul-Dwarov. They bear the likeness of those dwarf-lords of old and there still is a glint in their age-wizened eyes.\n\nMeanwhile the eyes of our soldiers seem to be not wise at all. Their joy about this grand discovery soon turned into a lust for the riches. All over the cavern people started divvying up the gold -- despite the expedition charter specifically saying that all loot would go into the coffers, not to the individual soldier."
 diggy_dungeons.155.a:0 "There is no reason to get overly excited, okay?"

 diggy_dungeons.156.t:0 "Completely Lost\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.156.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]One of the soldiers looks up from the campfire. “Where are we?” A simple question but it struck a very specific string with the rest of the expedition. Indeed, where were they?\n\nFor days, nay, weeks, the expedition had roamed the tunnels with no clue as to where they were actually heading. Soon voices started appearing that questioned the authority of the expedition leader, and demanded we focus on finding a way home."
 diggy_dungeons.156.a:0 "Search around to find some direction"

 diggy_dungeons.157.t:0 "Utter Loss of Control\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.157.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]All attempts at calming down the soldiers came to an end when even the expedition leader became afflicted by the cursed gold. As he descended upon the group of infighters he bludgeoned his way towards the coins, escalating the discussions into a full-blown fight.\n\nEventually the fighting stopped as the grim realisation set in what had happened. A senseless massacre that, in the end, benefitted absolutely no one. As the explorers settle down for the night there is a long silence in the camp. Those who fought were shunned by those who had resisted the urge, creating a dark emotional barrier within the camp. In the end it was decided that this gold should be left alone, that it would be too dangerous to bring it back."

 diggy_dungeons.158.t:0 "A Calming Presence\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.158.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The discussions and arguments slowly escalated into small brawls over particularly large and heavy coins. Even with people trying to calm down others nothing seemed to really work. Only after the booming voice of the expedition leader echoed through the room did people realise what was happening. One by one they began to calm down and began loading the coffers with the gold. They would still have a bad temper for the next few days, but eventually the horrors of the gold were behind them."

 diggy_dungeons.159.t:0 "Knowledge Elemental\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.159.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The last days had been marked by monotonous journeys through samey hallways and book-laden rooms. There was talk about being lost, but there were distinct signs of progress. Then the strange visions began. Soldiers would start babbling nonsensical stuff, quoting entire passages of books they had read once, or maybe never read at all. Some would start drawing maps of strange places, reciting poetry or arcane formulas. Then, there would be quiet for some time, then there would be outbursts again.\n\nAfter the third time a soldier quoted from “Lugnut's Treatise on the Strange Rumorations of What Lies Beyond the House of the Riddling Sun of Rubaa and How Kitling Would Not Recognize Her Mother” the expedition leader had enough. He called a large meeting to discuss what was going on.\n\nAfter some lively discussion (and one of the lieutenants telling the story of some elf in Cannor nobody had ever heard of) there was a consensus. They were haunted not by a ghost, but by a much stranger enemy: A knowledge elemental. Memory made real. But how would one even fight such an apparition?"

 diggy_dungeons.160.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Luckily for the expedition leader he had ordered the search just in the knick of time.

 diggy_dungeons.161.t:0 "Another Wrong Turn\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.161.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After three days of search it becomes painfully obvious: There is nothing here. They are in some insignificant part of the Serpentspine, with only insignificant rock around them.\n\nEventually, the expedition leader admits his failure. In a speech to the soldiers he addresses the confusions of the past weeks, which calms some of the more radical members, but is not helpful regarding general morale."

Only if the elemental has no host would it manifest as a proper creature that could be attacked. With the decision made, the enforcers went to business.\n\nWhenever the “visions” would begin in someone they were taken out, until suddenly the elemental appeared, a strange airborne creature cloaked in runes and whirling around. In this form, however, it was almost powerless and could do no real harm. A well-placed fireball finally got rid of it."

 diggy_dungeons.164.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Finally we have arrived at the centre of this affair. Hidden behind devious arcane traps and dangerous bookshelves lies a circular room with a high, domed ceiling. At its focal point stands a stone plinth with strange runes across its perimeter. From the runes rises a translucent figure emitting faint light in erratic bursts.\n\n“A living spell!” a mage says. Indeed, this new enemy is a living spell, magic made substantial. All of its power is bent on a single purpose: To expel foreigners, to safeguard the library. It has bested our attempts so far but its end is nigh!"

 diggy_dungeons.400.t:0 "Dimlherd, the Geothermal Facility"
 diggy_dungeons.400.d:0 "An ancient geothermal power facility dating back to the days of Aul-Dwarov, the famed Dimlherd of the Dwarovar has been rumored to lay beneath our very feet. Lacking concrete maps or logistics, sending a party of adventurers to explore the region would be a fool's errand. Yet it seems that we are indeed fools. The caverns below are an area of particularly dense volacanic activity, known for active lava flows, fiery geysers, and all manner of ghastly horrors native to the Serpenspine. Yet we must persist, for the glory awaiting us at the end of this trek shall be worth the many lives it will take to grasp it."
 diggy_dungeons.400.a:0 "Let's start exploring!"

 diggy_dungeons.401.t:0 "The Expedition Begins\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.401.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we descend into the dark depths, the path to the fabled facility forks, revealing two ways forward. A stream of molten lava scattered with remnants of piping dictates that the most direct path is along its banks. Yet the older and wiser among the adventuring band caution the captain to choose the safer and longer path alongside the ravine's ridge, where a narrow pass can be seen."
 diggy_dungeons.401.a:0 "Follow the lava stream."
 diggy_dungeons.401.b:0 "Take the safer path."

 diggy_dungeons.402.t:0 "Lava Tides\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.402.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At first, it was a mere rumbling sound in the distance. But as it drew nearer, it became clear that the stream we had been following along would soon rise, with splotches of molten rock already covering the path to our backs. Soon enough, the rocky pathway will flood in its entirety, and if nothing is done, we will soon rest beneath the glowing waves."
 diggy_dungeons.402.a:0 "Seek higher ground!"

 diggy_dungeons.403.t:0 "The Ridge Pass\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.403.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The closer we got to the secondary path, the clearer it became that we were mistaken. There would be no safety nor quarter. The ridge offered very little in the way of freedom of movement, precariously suspended over the ravine, with the stream of lava within clear view, a constant reminder of what would come to those unable to find their footing."
 diggy_dungeons.403.a:0 "This is insane. Let's just follow the river."
 diggy_dungeons.403.b:0 "Following along the path *carefully*."

 diggy_dungeons.404.t:0 "The Floor is Lava\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.404.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the rocky cliffs began to crumble away and many men tumbled into the lava below, those that remained could only spare a fraction of a second to process the devastating loss of their comrades. There would be no solace in grief, for as quickly as the tides enveloped the thin pass, it receded, leaving not even bones behind."

 diggy_dungeons.405.t:0 "Burned Toes\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.405.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the great rumbling subsided and the panic died down, it quickly became clear that we had gotten lucky. A false alarm. Or rather, a tide far less severe than originally anticipated. For if the scouts had been correct, there would be no men to continue the expedition."
 diggy_dungeons.405.a:0 "Rejoice, for we have been spared."

 diggy_dungeons.406.t:0 "An Unwilling Swim\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.406.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]No amount of caution could spare the party from the horrid fate that would soon follow. Walls crumbling as the ridge cleaved itself in two amidst tremors, depositing many of our comrades and pack animals into the lavaflow below."

 diggy_dungeons.408.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Of the many sights to be seen beneath the surface, few are as rare as the naga. A serpent with the face of a woman, these crafty spellcasters can make quick work of an adventuring party, using strategy and cunning to outmaneuver greater enemies. Slumped over a dilapidated turbine is one of these rarities, adorned with charcoal-black scales and lighting snoring with a satisfied grin. Fortune appears to remain with us."
 diggy_dungeons.408.a:0 "Attack the creature in its sleep."

 diggy_dungeons.409.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Standing before the expedition is an ancient dwarven outpost, clearly a remnant from before the Final Days. Boasting a sturdy door and several deactivated turrets, the contents of the building would probably still be untouched."
 diggy_dungeons.409.a:0 "Break the door down!"

 diggy_dungeons.410.t:0 "Stirred from Sleep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.410.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the naga slowly rises from its slumber, a bit of sage wisdom runs through the captain's mind. Dark nagas, identifiable by their ebony scales, are known mind-readers. Whilst the expedition's footsteps were quiet, the racing minds of so many adventurers was enough to alert the enemy."
 diggy_dungeons.410.a:0 "Wait, why hasn't it attacked yet?"

 diggy_dungeons.411.t:0 "Flayed Serpent\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.411.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The slaughter was swift and merciless, the corpse dumped into the lava stream after stripping it of valuables. Not a single adventurer lost their life in this battle."

 diggy_dungeons.412.t:0 "Acidic Blood\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.412.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The slaughter was swift, and the spoils wonderful. The serpent was flayed with due haste, with its meat mixed into our food stores. All seemed right in the world, until our men began dropping like flied. One, two, then a dozen more. Panic ensued, until the cause became known to all. Nagas possess acidic blood, deadly to ingest. Worse than that, it appears as though a large portion of the food stock has been contaminated."
 diggy_dungeons.412.a:0 "Why must we always learn lessons the hard way?"

 diggy_dungeons.413.t:0 "Mission Improbable\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.413.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The naga's light slumber was clearly far deeper than it seemed. As the anxiety-riddled adventurers attempted to sneak past, a great clanging sound ensued as a clumsy paladin's shield clattered to the ground, the bone-chilling sound echoing throughout the ravine. Yet the naga did not stir."
 diggy_dungeons.413.a:0 "We need to have a conversation about proper fastenings."

 diggy_dungeons.414.t:0 "Explosives, my Beloved\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.414.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The door was blasted off its hinges, and the mostly pristine contents of the tower were swiftly looted."

 diggy_dungeons.415.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the explosives are laid out before the door and detonated, the tower stood tall. Yet something else began to stir from the cavern."

 diggy_dungeons.416.t:0 "The Naga's Offer\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.416.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the beast licks her lips, the captain can hear her voice permeating through his skull, rattling between the ears like a windchime in a hurricane.\n\n"It is rare to receive guests. The warmth drives away. I have little to offer. Unlike you."\n\nA sickening deal. She offers her services as a guide, offering knowledge of a secret passage that will allow us to safely bypass a great danger. In return, she requests one thing: fresh meat."
 diggy_dungeons.416.a:0 "We are not mere cattle!"
 diggy_dungeons.416.b:0 "This will save lives. It is the only way."

 diggy_dungeons.417.t:0 "Flameskulls from Above!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.417.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Flameskulls are rumored to be the souls of the deceased, incarnate in the form of floating, flaming skulls of moderate killing ability. Their bone-chilling laughter echoes throughout the cavern as a battle formation is assumed, the enemy circling overhead."
 diggy_dungeons.417.a:0 "Clerics forward!"
 diggy_dungeons.417.b:0 "Battle formation!"
 diggy_dungeons.417.c:0 "Warriors, to the front!"

 diggy_dungeons.418.t:0 "Mutiny!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.418.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite that charisma of the party leader, the many individuals slated for execution by naga rose up in defiance and defense of their lives."
 diggy_dungeons.418.a:0 "I'm sure we can talk this out."

 diggy_dungeons.419.t:0 "A Deal Sealed in Blood\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.419.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It was over in an instant, countless souls engulfed by the naga's jaws. No witnesses. They were to have died in a cave-in, a tragic but ultimately unavoidable accident."
 diggy_dungeons.419.a:0 "A necessary sacrifice."

 diggy_dungeons.420.t:0 "Banished with Steel\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.420.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A quick response combined with deadly coordination made quick work of the floating fiends, reducing them to piles of bones. Despite our best efforts, the powdered skulls continue to smolder with a dull flame."
 diggy_dungeons.420.a:0 "We shouldn't linger."

 diggy_dungeons.421.t:0 "A Bone-Gnashing Defeat\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.421.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the skulls pass overhead, they leave deep burns in those they touch and cause chaos throughout our lines. The fight was brutal, but we eventually emerged victorious, though the cost was great."
 diggy_dungeons.421.a:0 "Let's not do that again."

 diggy_dungeons.422.t:0 "Banished with Holy Water\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.422.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the clerics chant their miracles, the flameskulls vanish into puddles of residue, coated in holy water to prevent ressurection."
 diggy_dungeons.422.a:0 "Never leave home without a cleric!"

 diggy_dungeons.423.t:0 "No Laughing Matter\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.423.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The final sounds of demonic cackling are silenced, and the cavern grows silent once more. A quick prayer for the fallen is held, then the expedition moves on."
 diggy_dungeons.423.a:0 "Let us ensure their sacrifice was not in vain."

 diggy_dungeons.424.t:0 "The Perimeter\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.424.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A welcome change from the monotonous igneous rock that dominated the landscape, a dwarven perimeter wall has come into vision. We have reached our first destination."
 diggy_dungeons.424.a:0 "Huzzah!"

 diggy_dungeons.425.t:0 "The Colossal Lavafall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.425.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]An astronomical waterfall of pure lava, crashing into a molten lake over 200 meters below. Such a sight would typically invoke a sense of awe, which was certainly present within our ranks. But this awe quickly turned to dread as the expedition realized that the desitnation lay at the bottom of this drop, with no side-paths to take."
 diggy_dungeons.425.a:0 "Break out the rock-climbing gear."
 diggy_dungeons.425.b:0 "Time for some extreme canoeing!"

 diggy_dungeons.426.t:0 "Stumbled, but not Fallen\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.426.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rock climbing under such volatile conditions is a tall order, yet the party managed with little trouble. A few unfortunate souls stumbled and perished in the fire below, but the bulk of us remain unscathed, less a few burns."
 diggy_dungeons.426.a:0 "All things considered, that went well."

 diggy_dungeons.427.t:0 "The Story of a Lifetime\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.427.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It is a rare thing to see genuine smiles and laughter following unfathomable danger, yet as the expedition reached the shore of the lava lake, cheers and celebration erupted. This meriment was not born out of hysteria or relief, but rather excitement. Hands shake, chests bump, and soiled greaves are cleaned and polished."
 diggy_dungeons.427.a:0 "No one will believe us."

 diggy_dungeons.428.t:0 "Quite the Fall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.428.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The great weight of our luggage combined with shoddy rock climbing has resulted in quite the wall collapse. As bodies tumble into the lava below, we must simply persevere."
 diggy_dungeons.428.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The field of lava canoeing is a largely unstudied one, unsurprisingly. And equally unsurprising was the result. Making makeshift canoes out of tarps that are definitely not lavaproof, filled to the brim with heavy and flammable cargo, then packing dozens of adventurers on each one, then hurtling this makeshit canoe off of a 200-meter tall cliff whilst lava rains from the sky. It's a miracle any of us survived."
 diggy_dungeons.428.a:0 "How could we have predicted this?"

 diggy_dungeons.429.t:0 "The Great Perimeter\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.429.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Surrounding the Geothermal Facility is a wall fortified with materials yet unknown to us. The vast surface of stone is occasionally interrupted by miniscule cracks seeping through, giving hope that the wall may yet be penetrable. Despite this, it may be best to look for a proper entrance before resorting to the direct approach."
 diggy_dungeons.429.a:0 "Today, we choose violence."
 diggy_dungeons.429.b:0 "Be safe, circle around!"

 diggy_dungeons.430.t:0 "Sturdy Beyond Measure\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.430.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite our best efforts, the wall yet stands, undeterred as if to scoff at the notion of our middling explosives leaving a scratch on it. Though this would typically be a demoralizing sight, fascination quickly sparked from the failure. Such a stone is undocumented by even our most thorough geographer's manuals."
 diggy_dungeons.430.a:0 "A marvelous discovery!"

 diggy_dungeons.431.t:0 "Explosives in a Live Volcano\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.431.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The satisfyingly ear-shattering sounds of explosives ring out throughout the cavern. Not a scratch on the wall. Moments later, eyes widen as the wall begins to rattle. Fleeting hope swiftly becomes despair as a realization is had; the entire cavern is shaking with the ferocity of an active volcano."
 diggy_dungeons.431.a:0 "Duck for cover boys!"

 diggy_dungeons.432.t:0 "The Burning Fever\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.432.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A fever is typically a sign of infection, yet this was clearly not the case within the magmatic depths. The ambient temperature of the caverns was simply high enough to induce fatigue, thirst, and even death. A particularly close pass with a stream of lava launches a new wave of heat at the party."
 diggy_dungeons.432.a:0 "Quickly, the water!"
 diggy_dungeons.432.b:0 "A little sweat never hurt anyone."

 diggy_dungeons.433.t:0 "The Eruption\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.433.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]"This is the last time we use explosives in an active volcano!"\n\nScreams echo throughout the cavern as men frantically seek shelter, begin setting for higher ground, and praying. Yet the calmer among the group manages to ralley the party, organizing them into a search party for an old dwarven failsafe."
 diggy_dungeons.433.a:0 "The dwarves of old were thorough; and so too must we be."

 diggy_dungeons.434.t:0 "Tempered Soul\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.434.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite the horrendous conditions, we stood strong amidst the wails of anguish. We are tenacity incarnate, and we will survive this danger, as we have time and time again."
 diggy_dungeons.434.a:0 "No adventurers will die this day!"

 diggy_dungeons.435.t:0 "The Silent Death\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.435.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Monsters we can deal with. Avalanches, disease, and the cold are preventable. Yet this heat felled more adventurers this day than all three of these things combined. We must pray for the fallen..."
 diggy_dungeons.435.a:0 "...and then continue moving."

 diggy_dungeons.436.t:0 "The Valve that Could.\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.436.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A single valve was all that stood between our lives and the encroaching magma. Yet a simple turn, combined with some old-fashioned elbow grease, was all it took to release the pressure from the volcano and prevent a full eruption."
 diggy_dungeons.436.a:0 "The marvels of engineering."

 diggy_dungeons.437.t:0 "Minor Eruption\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.437.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A minor eruption blasts throughout the caverns, wiping out the entirety of the advance party, and wounding a large portion of the main body. Hardly a party member was left without severe burns, even dozens of meters from the magma flow."
 diggy_dungeons.437.a:0 "Tend to your wounds swiftly, lest the lava comes back for another go."

 diggy_dungeons.438.t:0 "A Motly Camp of Kobolds\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.438.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]An unexpected sight indeed, it appears as though a group of kobolds have made their home alongside the perimeter of the facility, apparently relying on its defense mechanisms to protect themselves. Although everything down here seems to want us dead, these small creatures appear more frightened than anything, scurrying away at the slightest noise and refusing to fight us."
 diggy_dungeons.438.a:0 "Perhaps they can be reasoned with."
 diggy_dungeons.438.b:0 "Get em boys!"

 diggy_dungeons.439.t:0 "Delightful Conversation\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.439.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A few words are exchanged between the party linguist and what appears to be the chief of the kobolds. Two truths were revealed. Firstly, these kobolds are legendary masters of Dragonchess, competing with nearby tribes and developing numerous strategies our men had never even dreamed of. Secondly, and probably more importantly, they are not afraid of us, but of what lies aheads."
 diggy_dungeons.439.a:0 "Thanks for the warning, friends."

 diggy_dungeons.440.t:0 "Lost in Translation\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.440.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Dozens of tiny feet skitter away as the party linguist trips on his words. It appears as though the linguist had collectively insulted the entire tribe."
 diggy_dungeons.440.a:0 "At least they don't seem angry."

 diggy_dungeons.441.t:0 "Heroic Victory\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.441.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After a brilliant and hard-fought battle, the 3-foot tall kobolds scittered away, without dealing even a single casualty! As the men helped themselves to what wa sleft of the camp, we can't help but wonder why they didn't put up more of a fight."
 diggy_dungeons.441.a:0 "Eh, whatever."

 diggy_dungeons.442.t:0 "Pitfalls Abound\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.442.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the men charged foward, the ground gave way, and the entire advance party tumbled harmlessly into a shallow pit. Though nonlethal, the entire ordeal was very embarassing, and allowed the kobolds ample time to loot our belongings and be on their way."
 diggy_dungeons.442.a:0 "They took my pocketwatch!"

 diggy_dungeons.443.t:0 "Kobolds' Warning\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.443.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We have reached the fork in the road where the kobolds told us the beast would lurk. Taking a right, which is the desired destination, will bring us directly into its nest. Thankfully, we have learned of a roundabout path that should allow us to avoid the creature entirely."
 diggy_dungeons.443.a:0 "For glory!"
 diggy_dungeons.443.b:0 "Heed the kooblds' advice."

 diggy_dungeons.444.t:0 "Behir Sighted!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.444.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Among the creatures that one does not wish to see in the depths of the Dwarovar, the Behir is among the least desirable. A colossal beast, serpentine in nature but with twelve legs, blocks our way, with blue ligtning crackling at its mouth, blue eyes glistening with a sadistic delight. We have been caught wandering in its nest, and the only way out is to fight."
 diggy_dungeons.444.a:0 "For Carl!"

 diggy_dungeons.445.t:0 "The Facility Entrance\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.445.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We've finally arrived. The proper entrance of Dimlherd, the famed Geothermal Facility that powered a large portion of the ancient Dwarven Empire. Though we've reached our destination, all is not well. The clambering racketry of mechanical sentries emanates from the doorway. It is clear that, in order to pass through the door, we must handle the turrets first."

The beast clambered up and down the walls, gracefully weaving between projectiles and rock formations like a dancer across a stage. Even when arrows or spells met their mark, they bounced harmlessly off of the Behir's thick blue hide, less bothersome than a bee's sting. Yet our men were relentless. Dodging lightning breath and creating wards, they steadily and systematically took control of the situation, beating the Behir back with each successful blow. After many minutes of tense back-and-forth, silence envelops the field."

 diggy_dungeons.500.d:0 "For what seems like days the expedition has been travelling down, into the bowels of the earth. Down and down following what was once a spiralling stone staircase, now a smooth slope of stone worn by the passage of time and countless feet. The only sounds are the echoing of footsteps and clattering of supplies as each man concentrates on keeping his balance. So preoccupied are the men that they hardly notice it until they're mere feet away - a great gleaming set of steel doors set into the stone wall. The doors are pristine, intricately engraved and polished, so bright in the torchlight that after days of exploration in low light they are difficult to look at directly. Surrounding the doors are an intricate set of gears and levers, beautifully crafted and apparently free of debris.\n\nA cleric squints at the runes repeated across the doors, mouthing them aloud as he translates. "Grumhardhûm, it reads Grumhardhûm'' he calls out. At this, a ripple passes through the gathered expeditionaries. Many have heard stories of the legendary forge of Grumhardhûm, said to have armoured every hero and high king of Aul-Dwarov. It was often rumoured that craftsmen in Grumhardhûm lived for two lifetimes, as a lifetime of expertise was necessary to even be granted the privilege of working there. Few believed the legends referred to a real place, and of those none thought it may still be intact in any form millennia after the fall of Aul-Dwarov. Rumours and stories spread through the gathered men like wildfire, eventually forcing the leader of the expedition to intervene to restore order. Many wish to attempt to enter the forge now, or at least crack open the doors to glimpse the wonders inside. However, the men are tired and lacking supplies - as much as it pains the leader too, he knows they must return home for now. If the wonders of Grumhardhûm have survived until now, they can wait for one more expedition."

 diggy_dungeons.501.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Upon reaching the end of the maze of tunnels and the winding staircase marked on the map, the scouts suddenly stop. As the rest of the expedition pushes past them, it becomes clear why. Before them stands the great steel gate of Grumhardhûm, still resplendent and majestic as it was when it was abandoned, just as the previous expedition had reported. Filled with hope that the great forge had been spared the destruction that befell all else in the Serpentspine, several forward scouts attempt to push the great doors apart to gain entry. Soon there is a line of men pushing upon the doors in unison, but to no avail - the gate remains still and silent."
 diggy_dungeons.501.a:0 "Strike the gears and pry the gate open!"

 diggy_dungeons.502.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With one last push, and barely a whisper, the great gates swing open and the expedition hurries inside. As the gate closes behind the last man, everyone relaxes. The finely crafted doors are still unblemished and will provide a bulwark against any creatures attempting to sneak in from the rear. Beyond the threshold, the walls of the entrance corridor are covered in pipes and more carvings, but unlike the door these are blackened by soot and grime. The floor is likewise filthy, littered with metal and bone scraps, the unmistakable signs of a goblin infestation. Grimly but resolutely, the expedition moves towards the flickering orange light that illuminates the end of the corridor."

 diggy_dungeons.503.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Frustrated by an hour of no progress, a mage pushes through the throng of men around the gates and attempts to blast them open. As their spell connects a horrific grinding and shearing of metal upon metal echoes around the caverns, and the expedition instinctively covers their ears and cowers. By the time they look up the once great gates have fallen, now a bent and twisted heap of metal. As the expedition steps over the remains and moves into the forge, the mood is sombre. Each expeditionary mourns the loss of the great gates, not just for their artisanry but also for the defence from rear ambushes they would have provided. Their hopes are further crushed as they see the floor littered with metal and bone scraps and the carvings on the wall defaced by soot, the signs of a goblin infestation. Not wanting to dwell on the gates any longer, the expedition makes haste towards the flickering orange light illuminating the end of the corridor."
 diggy_dungeons.503.a:0 "I think I feel a draft from behind…"

 diggy_dungeons.504.t:0 "The Great Forge\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.504.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition approaches the end of the corridor, the temperature continues to rise. Soldiers sweat and shift in their heavy armour, looking enviously at the airy robes and simple leather armour afforded to others. Rounding a corner and entering the forge proper, a cavernous circular room bathed in the orange light opens up before them. Magma flows and drips from pipes running the length of the room, running to and from a great pit in the centre of the room. So wide is the pit that, combined with the heat haze present, nobody can see across it to the other side clearly. Some of the braver scouts venture to the edge, peering over it to see a great cauldron far below, suspended by huge chains with each link thicker than a man's torso. There are also simple metal elevators hanging haphazardly below, intended to bring workers to levels below this one, but they appear to be stuck and are out of reach for now. The floor is strewn with soot and debris - all kinds of metal, bone, cloth and food scraps lie everywhere. Looking up, a giant dome is far above, funnelling steam and other vapours into a huge hole at the apex. In the shadow cast by the dome, rusty metal scaffolding and rickety ladders lead to nooks populated with glowing unblinking eyes. Equidistant around the walls are carved stone doorways leading into miscellaneous rooms and antechambers, some with dedicated pipes serving them.\n\nAs the scouts return to report what they saw to the rest of the expedition, one steps upon a discarded sheet of pig iron. A screech of alarm rings out and a ruddy brown arm grabs their ankle - there was a feral goblin sleeping underneath it! Abandoning caution, the scouts sprint back to the main party as more goblins pour from the surrounding rooms and from around the pit. There is barely enough time for the expedition to close ranks around the scouts before the goblins crash into them."

 diggy_dungeons.505.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Using the narrow entrance corridor as a chokepoint, the feral goblins' charge was quickly broken upon the expedition's shields and spears with few casualties from the defenders. As the remaining goblins turn tail and flee it becomes apparent that the goblins' fallen brethren have brought quite a haul. Most of them were kitted in crudely modified armour and wielding weapons sourced from inside the forge - even after so many years of misuse, these pieces are still finely crafted and would fetch a high price from collectors."
 diggy_dungeons.505.a:0 "Ugh, this chestplate still has half a goblin in it."

 diggy_dungeons.506.t:0 "A Feral Goblin Tide\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.506.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The relentless flood of feral goblins overwhelmed the wall of shields and the expedition scattered, fleeing back down the corridor towards the entrance. By the time the expedition leader had rallied the troops for a counterattack to drive off the goblins, many of the more unfortunate men lay dead and trampled upon the floor in exchange for a pitifully small number of feral goblin lives. The dead are dragged solemnly into the entrance corridor to be retrieved later and the expedition continues as best it can."
 diggy_dungeons.506.a:0 "What a waste of lives…"

 diggy_dungeons.507.t:0 "Beasts Everywhere\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.507.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the immediate danger past, the expedition huddles together in an antechamber near the entrance to plan their next move. The untouched levels below are tantalisingly close, but they cannot continue until all the remaining squatters have been eradicated. The mages and scouts of the expedition present the leader with options for which to deal with first.\n\nHigh above, they have identified the eyes in the shadowed nooks and occasional echoing cries as those of giant cave bats. These bats are even larger than normal and what little of them can be seen has a distinctive reddish tint, leading several mages to suggest they may have been mutated by the residual magics of the forge. If the swarm is not dealt with swiftly, a careless action could bring them down upon the expedition.\n\nSomewhere on the same level as the expedition is the lair of the feral goblins that first assailed them. The remains of the feral goblin charge will have retreated there for safety, as the strongest goblins will be lounging about in the comfort of the lair. The lair will also contain the feral goblin clanboss' choice of loot scavenged from the forge. Cleansing the feral goblins will reward the expedition with these spoils, but it is impossible to know yet just how many lurk within the lair.\n\nLastly, a platform hangs between this level and the next surrounded on all sides by pipes. Judging by the various valves, dials and levers, the area was used to control the flow of liquids through the many pipes in the forge. Most of the controls are in disrepair and those that appear serviceable are covered by magma leaking from weakened pipe junctions. If the flow of magma to the upper levels can be disabled, it will prevent further dangerous leaks from the pipes above. Again, the mages caution that the unstable magics of the forge are likely to have spawned magma oozes wherever magma leaks, but these cannot be separated from regular magma without closer inspection."
 diggy_dungeons.507.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition regroups in the antechamber, leaning against walls and pillars for a well deserved rest. In the meantime, the expedition leader is again presented with the potential options to clear the remaining beasts."
 diggy_dungeons.507.a:0 "Bring down the giant bats!"
 diggy_dungeons.507.b:0 "Cleanse the feral goblin lair!"
 diggy_dungeons.507.c:0 "Splatter the magma oozes!"
 diggy_dungeons.507.e:0 "The beasts are cleared, let's examine the elevators."

 diggy_dungeons.508.t:0 "The Bats Above\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.508.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the antechamber a debate rages among the expedition about how best to handle the bats. "One fireball and the whole swarm will be set alight" argues a trigger-happy mage, "we won't even have to fight them!" This idea is quickly vetoed by the leader of the scouts "Are you crazy? You'll bring the whole scaffold down on us!" Before the mage can snap a response, he continues "besides, this whole place is hotter than a dragon's armpit. Those bats probably eat magma for breakfast… What if your fireballs make them stronger? Then we'll be fighting giant flaming bats!" After several more minutes, the expedition leader steps in to make the final decision - no fireballs. As some of the less disciplined mages sulk, he organises a group of armoured soldiers and light archers to face the bats, leaving the rest of the expedition to hunker down in the antechamber and wait.\n\nThe plan is simplicity itself. The soldiers will stand in a loose square around the archers, ready to protect them from any swooping bats. As of now the swarm has not been alerted so the first strike is the key to the whole operation. The archers have been instructed to aim for the glowing eyes in the darkness, calling out their target's position quietly to ensure no bat is targeted twice. Once all the archers have identified a target they will fire on the lead archer's mark, hopefully killing or disabling most of the swarm before they can even get close. Even without their great numbers the remaining bats may still be dangerous, as their leathery wings have been known to deflect arrows and chip swords. Still, so long as everyone remains calm the casualties should be kept to a minimum."
 diggy_dungeons.508.a:0 "Take aim…"

 diggy_dungeons.509.t:0 "The Goblins Lair\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.509.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Following the trails of blood left by the feral goblins, the expedition's scouts have located the lair. It sits in a room almost antipodal to the entrance, hidden by the heat haze over the central pit. The entrance has been repeatedly smashed and broken, enlarging it enough for more than 6 men to walk through shoulder to shoulder. The adjoining chambers have also had their doorways battered, inner walls collapsed and windows barricaded with sheet metal, creating a rather spacious lair protected from most of the heat of the forge. As the scouts watched, several dead feral goblins were brought from the lair and unceremoniously hurled into the central pit - no doubt their clanboss was angered by their failure to crush the expedition. Unfortunately, with the windows blocked the scouts were unable to ascertain how many goblins remain in the lair or where they store their loot.\n\nDespite the lack of information on their numbers, the expedition leader decides to carry out the strike immediately. Right now the goblins will be bickering and fighting over who should take the blame for their previous attack's failure, and who should risk their life to try again. If they can be caught off guard while trapped in their lair their looted equipment and possible numeric advantage will be completely nullified.\n\nHugging the walls of the forge chamber to remain undetected, the expedition approaches from both sides of the lair simultaneously. At the front are mages escorted by a small retinue of soldiers. On the leader's mark the mages will blast fireballs into the lair, summon flashes of light and plumes of smoke, and generally attempt to disorient all the goblins inside. Any goblins rushing out of the lair for reprieve will be swiftly cut down, and once the mages are spent the main body of the army will enter the lair to mop up the remains. As the leader begins counting down with hand signals a loud belch emanates from the lair doorway. Daring not to breathe, the whole expedition watches powerlessly as a cave troll lumbers out of the doorway. It turns to the side lazily, meeting the leader's gaze uncomprehendingly. As its eyes widen and it raises the misshapen hunk of metal it carries with both hands, the leader desperately cries "Now! Attack now!""
 diggy_dungeons.509.a:0 "Quickly, aim for the eyes!"

 diggy_dungeons.510.t:0 "The Magma Below\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.510.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Unsurprisingly, none of the expedition are keen on being sent down to the magma-covered platform hanging in the pit. After a quick drawing of lots, a small group of soldiers are chosen to accompany a water mage and an engineer down to the platform to attempt to disable the flow of magma. Sending too many men risks the weakened and overheated supports breaking, and so the remainder of the expedition can do nothing but watch as the group is lowered on chains to the platform. As the first soldier touches down on one of the few magma-free spaces, two magma oozes leap at them from the surrounding magma! Only a quick burst of water from the mage above him keeps them from engulfing him, and they are visibly shaken as the oozes recoil back into the safety of the magma.\n\nThe next few minutes are much the same - the group makes painfully slow progress across the platform, clearing pools of magma and dodging magma ooze ambushes as best they can. As they reach the dense tangle of pipes with controls, the engineer suddenly cries out "I can see the emergency shutoff pipes, but the valves are broken! I can't close them!". There is little time to make a decision - the water mage is visibly exhausted and out of mana potions, and several of the group have already perished to the oozes. If the valves can be repaired and the flow of magma arrested then the magma oozes on the platform will be severely weakened, perhaps enough to save the brave men down there. Though, their situation is already pretty dire… what's the worst that could happen if the group is simply allowed to perish?"

 diggy_dungeons.511.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the surrounding beasts cleared and the expedition out of danger for now, interest in exploring the lower levels of the forge is reignited. The elevators once used to travel between floors hang below, their chains tangled and rusted. Many of the elevators are missing platforms and guardrails and some have come loose altogether, barely visible laying battered and broken deep in the pit. In this state the expedition leader would be hard pressed to find a single man willing to travel down using these, let alone a whole expedition.\n\nAfter several hours of examinations with telescopes and attempts to untangle the elevators with blasts of air, the engineers have come up with a plan. Though most of the elevators are not worth fixing, a group of larger freight elevators have been preserved in good condition and have swung free from the debris binding them thanks to the efforts of the mages. Unfortunately, the brakes are still deployed on each elevator and their chains have been greatly weakened by the friction as the elevators slipped further and further down over time. If these elevators are hauled up intact, the only major repair required is the replacement of the length of chain that hung above the elevators. However, the engineers caution that the new chain must be of sufficiently sturdy metal or the next elevator to fall may take half the expedition with it.\n\nAmid the rhythmic cries of "Heave, Ho!" as the men haul the elevators up, the expedition leader considers his options. The expedition has small stores of steel, iron and bronze reserved for mending armour and emergency structural repairs. In a pinch, these could be fashioned into remarkably sturdy chains. Alternatively, the metal scraps strewn across the forge could be used instead - after all, they were good enough for the old dwarves of Grumhardhûm."

 diggy_dungeons.521.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition once again passes over the threshold of Grumhardhûm, the familiar heat of the forge hits them. This time, most of the expedition members have stowed the heavy armour they wore through the caves in favour of lighter leather and hide armour. Some mages have even procured magical armour engraved with temperature controlling runes, much to the jealousy of the other members. Many survivors of the last expedition have returned as expected, eager to see what hides in the lower levels that were made accessible by their previous efforts.\n\nSince the last expedition some small exploratory parties have braved the journey to the lower levels to scout ahead. All turned back quickly from the heat, unsettled by the unnatural emptiness of the cavernous forge. Their efforts were not in vain, however, as the last party noticed a peculiar stack of engraved metal plates on the lower levels near an elevator. Some of these plates were scattered around as well and they appear to have all originally been identical. The plates are all melted, dented, torn or scratched in different places - no fully intact plate exists. The engraving is clearly some form of runic script, but deciphering the whole message is difficult. Additionally, the back of some of the plates holds a different engraving.

The message on the rear is a notice to workers, reminding them what they should do if the great furnace beneath the forge was to ever go out.

 diggy_dungeons.525.t:0 "Beneath The Cauldron\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.525.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition travels slowly down the repaired freight elevators, they take in the sights surrounding the huge cauldron of the great forge. Metal rings of flooring similar to the top level surround the cauldron at different heights. Great pipes lead to and from the cauldron and smaller vats, forges, smithing stations and carved chambers on each floor. These floors are much better preserved and have not been infested by squatters, owing to the difficulty of reaching them. Still, the squatters managed to despoil the lower floors with rotting bodies and trash left lying near the edges of the floors and piled up in the great cauldron, thrown into the central pit with no care for the destination. Soot blankets the floors and walls of each level, crunching underfoot and leaving ugly black stains behind. Below the huge cauldron on the bottom floor lies a fine mesh, still smouldering and belching strange vapours. The great furnace below has not completely extinguished even after millenia of disuse, leaving the whole of Grumhardhûm swelteringly hot. Some engineers of the expedition shudder, imagining working here when the furnace was still at full blast.\n\nOnce the repaired elevators touch the bottom floor for the first time, the expedition's scouts dart off to explore the depths of Grumhardhûm. A ring of engraved steel surrounds the mesh on the bottom floor, though it is difficult to see through the ankle-high piles of dust, bones, soot and metal scraps that have collected over time. A rough stone tunnel is the only exit in the walls of the bottom floor, in line with the entrance gate far above. The scouts who entered the tunnel return blackened with soot and panting for breath. They descended in a gentle sloping spiral, approaching the smouldering furnace beneath the mesh. Their exploration was halted by magma pouring lazily from cracks above and in the walls, covering the huge steel bridge in front of them. As far as they could tell the bridge is still intact but the magma must be cleared to gain access to the furnace.\n\nAfter reviewing the structure and pipeworks of the forge, the engineers of the expedition have determined the magma blocking the bridge should be flowing into the furnace below. Something is blocking the pipes into the furnace and causing an overflow of magma. How the forge is still smouldering without the heat from the magma is unknown, but irrelevant for now. Judging by the inscriptions that remain on each level the penultimate level is the best bet to clear the magma. Somewhere on that floor are the controls to manage the flow of magma, and water used to generate steam, into the furnace below. The scouts look to the expedition leader, wondering where to search first."
 diggy_dungeons.525.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition exits the chamber, returning to the soot-strewn penultimate level of the forge. Everyone settles down, leaning against walls and pipes to catch their breath as best they can in the sweltering heat of the forge.

 diggy_dungeons.526.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The left side of the penultimate level is home to a series of small control chambers. All these chambers were once almost identical, containing pipes rising up from the floor and into the ceiling of each, adorned with various valves and levers. Now the control chambers are a spectrum from almost untouched to no more than a pile of rubble in a doorway. Unfortunately the inscriptions above each room have long since worn away, making it difficult to tell what purpose even the intact control rooms serve. After a fruitless search for any more clues to each room's purpose, the expedition leader dispatches an engineer and a mage to the bottom floor. With a combination of divination and mechanical knowledge, they locate the pipes buried in the rock that run to the furnace and follow them back up into the chamber that controls them.\n\nAt first it appeared that the expedition was out of luck - the chamber the engineer pointed to was one full of rubble. After a little excavation, however, it was clear that the rubble was from the partial collapse of only one wall. With some improved braces a further collapse is prevented, and once the rubble is cleared out the expedition leader can walk through the open path into the control chamber. Mercifully, the pipes and controls were not touched by the collapse and are still mostly intact.\n\nThere are only three controls on the pipes, a pair of iron valves surrounding a strange reddish lever. The valves were once coloured too - there are small flecks of paint still stuck to the rear of them. It seems that the left valve was once a peculiar light green, while the right valve was a deep yellow colour. Aside from the pipes running up the back wall and these controls, the room is an empty uniform cube only large enough for a handful of people. Alone in the room for now, the expedition leader ponders his options."

Unusually, there's a large carved stone tunnel as well. It's long but narrow, with smoothly curving walls and tipped with a simple stone staircase leading upwards. Curiously the air in the tunnel is comparatively cooler and pleasantly humid, more akin to a beach holiday than a desert trek. The scouts sent into the tunnel are forced to return soon, however. The flickering orange light from above the staircase and the chaotic magic energies swirling in the tunnel can only mean one thing - an infestation of magma oozes.\n\nThe cool air means there is very little magma in the tunnel, so each ooze should be comparatively weaker than the ones experienced on the first floor. Still, the tunnel is far too narrow for a large force to enter, whereas the amorphous oozes will have no problem utilising their numbers. Ignoring the men clamouring to stand in the refreshing draft, the expedition leader begins selecting a team to clear the tunnel."

The expedition's debate regarding the conditions required to spawn a magma oozes is interrupted by a strange burbling noise. The sound is similar to that of a sea swell, as though something huge is moving below the magma under the bridge. By the time most of the expedition realises the danger, the scouts are too late to run back to safety. The expedition leader watches helplessly as a gigantic magma ooze surges around both sides of the bridge under the scouts. It engulfs that section of the bridge, and the unfortunate scouts, in a single movement. The scouts never even had a chance to scream. Breaking free from his stupor, the expedition leader has only seconds to decide on a course of action before the ooze engulfs them too."

Luckily their numbers aren't overwhelming, but with so much magma around they'll be far more dangerous than the ones encountered earlier.

 diggy_dungeons.537.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition advances towards the location of the furnace, the tunnel becomes rougher and less uniform. This was clearly once part of a natural cave system and was left mostly untouched by the dwarves constructing the forge. Light flickers strangely off ore seams and the walls seem to close in as they keep advancing. The heat grows and grows until the expedition is walking through a visible heat haze, with many mages reporting visible magical distortions as well. Finally, a huge pair of doors are illuminated before them. These are similar to the doors at the entrance of the Grumhardhûm, but they show signs of being hastily barricaded from this side. Steel bars, sheets of iron and other makeshift materials have been bolted and welded to the gates and hastily carved inscriptions and wards cover the whole door. Evidently, despite the forge being abandoned in a hurry, the inhabitants were gravely concerned about whatever was behind that door.\n\nThis is the last straw for the expedition leader. Many of the expedition are at risk of passing out from the heat, with mages reporting nausea and dizziness from the chaotic magical energies swirling before the doors. He knows that in this state even a flock of bats would pose a serious challenge, let alone whatever is sealed behind those doors. The expedition retreats back across the steel bridge for now, resolving to return better prepared to face whatever lies inside."

The difference between the work of nature and of man is striking after so long spent in the painstakingly carved rooms of the forge. It appears that once a great underground river flowed through the cavern, slowly carving peculiar channels into the rock. The sound of flowing water still echoes down the cavern, but a bronze dam blocks the river. The dam stretches most of the way up to the cavern ceiling, with four great gates lined along the base. These four gates are open, but clogged with debris from upstream, leaving the underground riverbed bone dry. Scouts sent to climb the dam report that there's a bubbling stream on the other side, not quite large enough to fill the whole cavern even with the dam open. At the other end of the underground riverbed, the floor suddenly drops and huge pipes snake off in different directions to deliver water to the forge.\n\nIt seems that the dam gates were once controlled mechanically, as they are far too heavy to be operated by hand. They also had retractable grates, presumably to prevent them being clogged as they are now, but they were either torn from the dam or left up. The valves and levers on the dam itself do nothing now, so the debris will need to be cleared another way."

The great ooze took many expedition members as it surged down the bridge, but it was reluctant to step off the bridge and away from the pool of magma. This moment of hesitation was just barely enough to allow the men time to counter attack. They fought desperately, even throwing their shields and armour at the ooze to try and delay it. After a truly herculean effort from every member the ooze suddenly broke apart, returning to an inert pool of magma and slipping from the bridge. Now, as the expedition leader takes stock of those who have survived, he notices a battered steel chest covered in weakly glowing runes left behind on the bridge. The magma must have swallowed this chest long ago but thanks to the protective runes carved upon it the contents are still intact. Inside are a cache of ancient dwarven scriptures and engravings.

As new oozes spawn the flow of magma from above slows, and the oozes slow too. Eventually, having used most of the pooled magma, the last oozes are destroyed by the expedition.

Each expedition member is tied to ropes ready to catch them when the blockage has been weakened enough and decides to suddenly break free.

The inscriptions hastily scrawled across the door are an epithet, repeated in several ancient scripts including old dwarven. "They all roughly mean Old Fire Lord, Aldorlbûr in the forge's native dwarven", explains a linguist brought along to examine the doors. A noble with such a title doesn't appear in any ancient chronology, though it hardly matters as any living being would have perished after so long locked inside the furnace. As the last bars are torn from the doors they swing open eerily of their own accord, revealing the top of a scorched steel staircase.\n\nA blast of hot stale air from inside the doors washes over the waiting expedition members. The heat throughout the forge has worsened since the previous expedition cleared the magma from the bridge into the furnace, but this extra heat is the final straw. Everyone stumbles back from the doors hoping to escape the dry heat licking at their bodies. Ignoring the orders of the expedition leader, most of the men continue to retreat back as far as they can from the doors and towards the comparatively cooler forge.\n\nWith the whole expedition gathered before the bridge again, the mood is low and many wish to turn back before even entering the furnace.

Discarded pieces of armour have been welded to the floor by the heat and are surrounded by piles of ash, the remains of whatever unfortunate souls surrounded Aldorlbûr when it escaped. The wards must have been extremely powerful to keep the elemental imprisoned for so long and to sustain such little damage as it ravaged the area as revenge.

It is difficult to ignore the desperate cries of those Aldorlbûr has left badly burned but there is nothing the expedition's medics can do until the fire elemental is clear. Wary of overextending, both the expedition and Aldorlbûr circle each other, making occasional probing attacks. If physical attacks do any lasting damage to Aldorlbûr is unknown, so instead these serve as a distraction for mages to strike. It has been struck with various spells and projectiles by now, but unfortunately very little water. The elemental dances and dodges around even a drop of water, evaporating it or hurling pipes at it rather than meeting it with its body. This fear is easily exploited to create openings, but the unlucky person who sent the water is usually targeted and incinerated by the elemental soon after. After what feels like hours, the fire elemental is finally beginning to show signs of weakness. Its body no longer burns so painfully bright and its attack range and speed have lowered noticeably.\n\nIn a stroke of luck, a brave mage blasts a jet of icy water at Aldorlbûr right as it rears up for another attack. Unable to dodge, the water strikes its centre mass and this time it visibly recoils with a horrible shriek. The mage is reduced to ashes soon after, but the damage has been done. Clearly rattled by such a hit, Aldorlbûr is now squarely on the defensive. It no longer initiates attacks, opting instead to slip and weave away from all projectiles, waiting for men to overcommit. Focusing entirely on defence makes the elemental near untouchable - after some time of this with precious few hits it begins to regain confidence, apparently unaware of the expedition's true plan. Hoping to corral it back towards the cage to seal it back for good by utilising its newfound wariness, the expedition have been carefully guiding Aldorlbûr with their attacks. With each casual dodge, the fire elemental approaches the cage inch by inch."

 diggy_dungeons.561.t:0 "Seared Into Their Memory\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.561.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Waves of fire crash into the expedition, roasting and burning indiscriminately. They fight valiantly, but the fury of Aldorlbûr is simply too raw, too powerful. The expedition leader watches helplessly from the cavern floor as the last of his men run aflame back into the maze of piping, hoping desperately to escape. Aldorlbûr waits cruelly, letting them exhaust themselves and those around him burn to death in agony. Hoping to distract it long enough for even one man to flee, the expedition leader lunges for Aldorlbûr. For a moment he swears he can see the ghost of a smile on the fire elemental's smooth head, and then…\n\nThe small guard left outside the steel doors to the furnace are playing cards, bored and sweaty. An agonised wail echoes out from the furnace entrance, jolting the guards from their game. They rush in, finding a half-burnt engineer collapsed at the base of the entrance staircase. They carry him out and lay him on their makeshift table, but it is too late. So terrible was the heat he endured that his clothes have fused with his body and his eyes have melted shut. Barely audible, all he murmurs is "Aldorlbûr… Aldorlbûr…" until he finally dies minutes later. The guards wait and wait, but no more survivors ever appear."
 diggy_dungeons.561.a:0 "An unthinkable tragedy…"

 diggy_dungeons.562.t:0 "A Necessary Sacrifice\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.562.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Before the expedition could flee, Aldorlbûr suddenly leapt forward and encircled a portion of the expedition in towering flames. With the fire elemental distracted with its new playthings, the rest of the expedition slipped away with the screams of their fellows echoing in their ears. Wracked with guilt, they distract themselves with the mindless task of navigating the cavern."
 diggy_dungeons.562.a:0 "Better them than us."

 diggy_dungeons.563.t:0 "Almost Too Easy\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.563.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Resting for a moment near a group of crumbling stone pillars, the expedition lets out a collective sigh of relief after escaping from Aldorlbûr again. Using the hole in the pipes the fire elemental created, they were able to slip around it as it circled them and once again flee from it practically unscathed. Though most are overjoyed, some can't help but wonder if Aldorlbûr is simply savouring the chase…"
 diggy_dungeons.563.a:0 "Who can know what such a being thinks."

 diggy_dungeons.564.t:0 "An Unyielding Cage\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.564.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The last mage stumbles back, drained, as the wards hum back to life. Even the non magical members of the expedition can feel the wards tugging at them, yearning to imprison and stifle them. The cage emits a steady, comforting hum as well. The strength of the cage is not in doubt to anyone - if Aldorlbûr can be brought here then it will certainly be defeated and imprisoned once more. The only problem is it is equally aware of this, likely preferring to die fighting than end up in there for another eternity. Stiil, the newly powered up cage provides more than a measure of comfort."
 diggy_dungeons.564.a:0 "A cage fit for a lord."

 diggy_dungeons.565.t:0 "Reactivate The Golems\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.565.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Golems of iron, steel and stone protrude from the ground before the expedition. Frozen in the throes of a desperate defence, these are clearly abandoned security golems. Many appear to have survived Aldorlbûr's wrath in good condition, but closer inspection reveals that their joints have fused from the heat. Their mana batteries are still serviceable but they will need to be carefully repaired before being recharged to be of any use. An army of unflinching golems mostly immune to the heat will be the perfect distraction, so long as they can actually fight. As engineers and mages try to co-operate on the golems, men keep a nervous watch on them. The golems should recognise the fire elemental as the bigger threat and assist the expedition, but who knows what time and decay has done to their programming."
 diggy_dungeons.565.a:0 "An unsettling window into the past."

 diggy_dungeons.566.t:0 "The Final Push\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.566.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Aldorlbûr is beginning to tire of fighting. All the while it was trapped in that horrible prison it had yearned to burn and scorch with impunity. Outside, no being should be equal to it! Pure fire reduces all to ashes, nothing should be able to quench it! Yet the accursed mortals that invaded its cavern stubbornly defy its flames, refusing to submit. At first Aldorlbûr was glad to have new playthings, but they now behave more like an insect buzzing incessantly about its head. Hounded by the expedition, as much as Aldorlbûr does not want to admit it, they are beginning to wound it deeply. Occupied with hate and visions of sending the expedition to a fiery demise, Aldorlbûr doesn't feel the tugging on its very being until it is too late - it stands before its most hated cage with the expedition to its back. No escape.\n\nThe expedition watches as the fire elemental freezes in place before the runic cage, finally understanding their plan. It sends tendrils of flames to the walls and cage, but they suddenly recoil before even halfway. Its prideful demeanour has collapsed and its fear of the cage is palpable, but with the exit blocked by the expedition Aldorlbûr has no choice but to attack them once more. This time, it won't be holding back."
 diggy_dungeons.566.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Aldorlbûr is deceptively close to the runic cage, but by no means is the final stretch the simplest. Many have perished to it already, as it has turned into a flaming bulwark with the last of its strength. Denying the expedition the satisfaction of victory, Aldorlbûr would clearly rather be reduced to cinders than return to the cage. Nevertheless, to come this far and fail here is unacceptable. "It is worse off than we are! Look, its desperation is clear. It needs only one more push, just one strong strike! Just once more!" cries the expedition leader as the exhausted elemental rears up for another wave of fire."
 diggy_dungeons.566.a:0 "You will spend another eternity in that cage Aldorlbûr!"

 diggy_dungeons.567.t:0 "Fill The Sprinklers\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.567.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The lead engineer calls a stop to the expedition's fleeing. He has found a long wall of intact pipes that run up to, among other places, the sprinklers set into the cavern ceiling. Raining water down on the elemental would be an excellent assistance, if only it was that simple. The pipes invite flashbacks of the forges control rooms, covered in valves and levers of obscure purpose. The expedition leader has no choice but to assign volunteers to follow each pipe junction and determine what it carries and where. Painstakingly slowly, the engineers construct a mental map of the pipes in the cavern, turning valves and pulling levers to try and fill the sprinklers above once more."
 diggy_dungeons.567.a:0 "What fool forgot to carve instructions here?"

 diggy_dungeons.568.t:0 "A Lumbering Regiment\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.568.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Expedition members jerk back in surprise as light suddenly burns in a golem's eyes. It straightens up, pulling itself from the indent it has made in the floor and examining the expedition. After a few tense moments, everyone relaxes as the golem makes no moves to attack. Soon it is joined by a handful of its fellows in an unnaturally straight line, awaiting the expedition leader's orders."
 diggy_dungeons.568.a:0 "You soldiers could learn a thing or two from them."

 diggy_dungeons.569.t:0 "So Close Yet So Far\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.569.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Aldorlbûr has dug itself into the floor, trying to keep the expedition back with pure heat. It won't retreat so much as an inch towards the cage. Waves and waves of blue fire roll off of the elemental, forcing the expedition to take cover wherever they can. Finally, the waves of fire stop and men step out to finish the exhausted elemental. They are met with another wall of flames - it was a trap! Those at the front absorb most of the heat leaving those at the back physically unharmed, but the shock of seeing their fellows burn to death under their noses stuns them completely. With the expedition routed temporarily, Aldorlbûr sags again - this time, it really is exhausted. So painfully close to victory, the expedition leader picks himself up and rallies the expedition for another push."
 diggy_dungeons.569.a:0 "Fight, to the last man!"

 diggy_dungeons.570.t:0 "The Furnace, Reignited\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.570.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Step by step, the expedition closes in on Aldorlbûr. No longer can it incinerate them lazily as it had so many of their fellows, its paltry blasts of fire easily blocked by mages and shields. It is clear that Aldorlbûr is now the hunted rather than the hunter. Within touching distance now, a barrage of arrows, magical projectiles and even canteens of water are hurled at the fire elemental as it desperately hangs on to the rocky floor. Losing purchase, the gravity of the cage finally exceeds its strength and it begins to slip further and further back towards it. Desperate otherworldly shrieks and cries unlike anything the expedition have heard echo around the cavern. As a last ditch effort, Aldorlbûr abandons its form and looses fiery tendrils to all corners of the room and ceiling searching desperately for an escape. Hacking at the living fire with swords and dousing it with water weakens the tendrils, which flicker, then disappear completely. Reduced to nothing more than a fist sized orb of fire, Aldorlbûr is jerked back into the runic cage as the front swings shut with a conclusive crash.\n\nThe triumphant expedition still lays upon the floor hours later, completely exhausted from their efforts. Before them Aldorlbûr seethes inside the runic cage, trapped again for the foreseeable future. With the whole of the Grumhardhûm cleared and free of danger and the ancient source of heat sealed once again the complete reconstruction of the forge can begin in earnest. Well, another group can head down to the furnace to do the repairs in earnest - the expedition members will be looking forward to their pay and a nice long vacation somewhere cool after this harrowing experience."
 diggy_dungeons.570.a:0 "Truly, a cage fit for a lord."

 diggy_dungeons.571.t:0 "A Comforting Shower\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.571.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]"There!" exclaims the lead engineer as he turns the last valve with a flourish. Immediately the sprinkler directly above blasts the floor around them with foul water, and he scrambles to turn the valve back off as unlucky expedition members around him are splashed. At least now they know the sprinklers certainly work - and with unexpected force! Activated at the right time, they will be a great boon against Aldorlbûr."

 diggy_dungeons.800.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It is said that there are regions even below the lowest caverns known to dwarf- and goblinkind. Tales of strange creatures, gigantic towering shrooms. If that is the case, then this might be the wound through which we can penetrate rock and earth and gain access to these lands.\n\nBut perhaps not.\n\nWhat is the case is that in a recent expedition the men had to stop and go elsewhere because a yawning abyss stretched out in front of them that, due to its unbelievable size, proved impossible to pass. The expedition leader made a mental note and when he returned, told the administration. Interested in what this chasm might hold, another expedition was created with the sole purpose of exploring this chasm."
 diggy_dungeons.800.a:0 "For if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes back into you."

 diggy_dungeons.801.t:0 "The Precipice\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.801.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition stands at the yawning abyss. No light seems to penetrate the inky-blotted darkness in front of them. Everyone takes a deep breath. Nothing more and nothing less than uncertainty awaits them.\n\nThe expedition leader looks around and surveys the cliff. After discussing some possibilities he needs to make the decision on how to descend into the chasm. The wall is littered with spikes jutting out of the rock-like roots, as far as the eye reaches. With enough rope and precaution, it should be possible to get through.\n\nAnother possibility would be to follow the edge until a slope or some kind of the natural point of entry can be found."

 diggy_dungeons.802.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]No matter how far we look, we can find nothing to help us get down the chasm. Even worse, the labyrinthian edge has got us completely disoriented to the point where we can't even find where we started. Our only option is to climb down - for better or for worse.\n\nFor worse. The climb is arduous and many of our men fall during the descent. Then, suddenly, the rope gives way and we start sliding down the chasm, deep, deep into the black unknown."

 diggy_dungeons.803.t:0 "The Path Is Clear\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.803.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After a few days of search the scouts have found a clear path into the chasm. An underground river has carved a steady decline into the rock that we can follow without a problem.\n\nAs we continue on downwards the carved rock reveals gold and gems in the walls. Without much debating, the men get out some pickaxes and start excavating the treasure. With a song on their lips and their coffers already noticeably heavier they continue down in the best of spirits."

 diggy_dungeons.804.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Carefully the soldiers apply and reapply the rope where needed. In small groups, we descend into the pit, but every step is safe and secure. The slow climb has people on the lookout for other things, which has born us riches: It would seem others have tried our approach as well, trying to get down here, but they did not fare so well. Some of their backpacks are still hanging on the spikes, we just need to grab them and what's inside is ours."

 diggy_dungeons.805.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The rope's promise of safety is as alluring as it is misleading. The spikes are slippery, the rope has nowhere to be fastened to, and every once in a while a climber falls to their death: That is the reality of our endeavour. At some point, it became useless to count how many had fallen and the soldiers just agreed to ignore it. Everyone for themselves.\n\nFinally on the ground we can see the terrible toll the wall has taken on us. At least one hundred corpses piled just here, with more dispersed around the area. The expedition leader looks away and into the chasm stretching out next to us, eager to continue and let this small disaster behind him."
 diggy_dungeons.805.a:0 "Let's see what else this damnable pit has to offer"

 diggy_dungeons.806.t:0 "Rope Bridge\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.806.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The chasm had offered us two paths a few days ago, one down and one keeping level. After some deliberation, the expedition chose to go onward on their current level. This has yielded tentative agreement from the explorers as they did not want to go down much further for now.\n\nThe path turned out to be interesting enough in its own right. It snakes along the walls of the chasm and at some point, we could make out a similar path on the other side. Some were discussing how we might get over there, but even before they could come to a conclusion, the scouts reported they had sighted a rope bridge just ahead.\n\nThe rackety structure is made of thick rope and sturdy wood, but it does show signs of wear and tear. The question it poses is simple: Do we need to secure it? Or will it hold the weight of our expedition on its own? "
 diggy_dungeons.806.a:0 "It'll hold"
 diggy_dungeons.806.b:0 "Secure it"

 diggy_dungeons.807.t:0 "Fungal Flats\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.807.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Following our adventure down the rope has led us to another point of interest: In the distant dark the scouts have made out some kind of terraces along the side of the wall. After arriving there, we noticed that these are old terrace farms, now entirely overgrown by a strange kind of fungus. It looks like nothing we had seen before and there was some interest in sampling it. The cooks were especially fascinated by its unique sweet-savoury odour."
 diggy_dungeons.807.a:0 "A few fungi? What's the worst that can happen"

 diggy_dungeons.808.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the end the bridge did hold our weight. Without much problem (but a considerable amount of swinging) the expedition could cross the chasm in small groups. On the other side was a small campsite with long abandoned tents showing signs of animal attacks. Inside a few skeletons could be found, still clutching their belongings."
 diggy_dungeons.808.a:0 "They won't need those anymore"

 diggy_dungeons.809.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It is strange how a single sound can absolutely devastate a person.After most of the expedition had crossed the bridge the rope gave up. With an audible snap the bridge broke apart, sending the men in free fall into the dark below."

 diggy_dungeons.810.t:0 "Old Campsite\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.810.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the old bridge behind us we have stumbled across a large abandoned campsite, almost constituting a small village. This sparked immediate interest in what might be possible to uncover here, since all the occupants seem to have abandoned it long ago."

 diggy_dungeons.811.t:0 "A Hearty Meal\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.811.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The cooks prepared a mighty meal with the mushrooms which invigorated the soldiers. With this newfound elan some decided to start planting more mushrooms, should they return via this way again. What they didn't think was finding buried chests in the ground. With a few ropes and muscles put to work seven chests filled with gold and gems could be unearthed."
 diggy_dungeons.811.a:0 "Food and loot? What a great place!"

 diggy_dungeons.812.t:0 "POISON!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.812.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Well, who would have thought that. The eating spree yesterday turned out to be a stupid idea. This morning many people have started complaining about strong abdominal pain and vomiting. As the day went on the fever came. Then the hallucinations. And finally, death. The cooks try to find some, any excuses, but there are none. Still, we need to eat so they are spared. For now."
 diggy_dungeons.812.a:0 "Stop just putting things in your mouths!"

 diggy_dungeons.813.t:0 "Waterfall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.813.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The thundering clash and hammering of water against the beaten rock echoes through the chasm. The rushing masses have carved their own way deep into the rock, their source hidden somewhere far above, their destination deep below. It poses an almost impassable obstacle since the crushing stream of water would turn us into flat sheets without hesitation."
 diggy_dungeons.813.a:0 "We need to get around"

 diggy_dungeons.814.t:0 "Empty Promises\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.814.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Much to our dismay whoever left this campsite took everything with them. Only the ragged tents remain now. Nothing could be found, even turning the rocks around and digging under the tents could reveal anything. Gruntled, the soldiers got back into formation and marched onwards, complaining about the fruitless search for days."
 diggy_dungeons.814.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Upon further inspection a pathway revealed itself behind the waterfall, leading around it towards a small cave filled with crates and chests. This immediately got our senses for treasure tingling and without much ado, the crates and chests were opened. Much to our dismay, however, they were all empty. All except one which housed the skeletal remains of a rat. After the initial euphoria of the promise of loot, this result was not well received by the expedition and with low spirits, they continued their journey."
 diggy_dungeons.814.a:0 "Unfortunate, but we need to go on"

 diggy_dungeons.815.t:0 "Hidden Riches\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.815.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Luckily for us the waterfall posed not only an obstacle, but also concealed its own demise: A ledge behind the water leads under and around, and, even better, reveals a stash of crates and chests that eagerly wait to be opened. Without much ado the soldiers take out their crowbars and burst them open, revealing glittering gold and gems. They throw their arms into the air upon seeing the successful result of their discovery and quickly fill our coffers with the acquired loot."
 diggy_dungeons.815.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Whoever left the tents also left their belongings here. Bags with coins, riches hidden beneath the tents, a great display of treasure. This find immediately invigorated our soldiers who long to get paid for their services with the very gold they had just found lying around here."

 diggy_dungeons.816.t:0 "Structures, Taken By Time\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.816.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At last we have reached the bottom of the chasm. For months we have scaled the walls, and rested on ledges and terraces, but now we have solid ground under our feet again. We can feel the heat emanating from the very stone here, it is hot and wet, steam blowing from tiny vents into the chasm. After a short break, the expedition leader assesses the situation. Scouts report that there seem to be some man-made structures ahead, rubble and broken walls.\n\nWhen we arrived we could see the full extent of the ruins. In what must have once been a temple complex of some kind with broken columns and "

 diggy_dungeons.817.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the centre of the temple, hidden under stone and dust, lies the coffers of those who once directed believers. The priests must have collected liberal tithes because the gold amassed under the altar is a considerable amount. Strange faces and figures adorn the coins, with the most valuable having a worm or slug-like creature with an oversized head on its face."
 diggy_dungeons.817.a:0 "Weird, but okay"

 diggy_dungeons.818.t:0 "An Unwelcome Surprise\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.818.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we search through the temple we are suddenly surprised by a group of ghostly apparitions hovering menacingly towards us. Their faceless heads scream without mouths, their wailing cry penetrates flesh and bone."

 diggy_dungeons.819.t:0 "In The Depths\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.819.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]So we have arrived at the deepest point we could find. A barren place, yet still, someone - or something - had built a livelihood here. The temple shows signs of sophisticated craftsmanship. Whatever might be here, it will take more time to discover it. For now we must return what we have found and chart a safe way down for the future."
 diggy_dungeons.819.a:0 "This is just the beginning"

 diggy_dungeons.820.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The ghastly apparitions flew towards us, their icy breathtaking us by surprise. Yet they seem to be weak, their influence upon us barely noticeable. Through some they passed their ethereal bodies, creating a faint layer of ice on the skin through which they went. Those who had multiple ghosts go through them would not stand up again, but in the end, the wraiths disappeared. In their place lay now icy crystals glittering in the torchlight. They are cold to the touch and don't seem to warm up and don't melt, a fascinating and, most likely, valuable discovery."

 diggy_dungeons.821.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The wraiths descended upon the men, their icy bodies passing through us like a hot knife through butter. Many fell to the ground, their breathing hard and staggered, their skin blue and cold. The apparitions would make some more passes over and through us but then disperse again. Some of those who fell stood up once more, their flesh returning to normal, but others had gone too far into the ice, their eyes of horror frozen in place for eternity."
 diggy_dungeons.821.a:0 "May they rest in peace"

 diggy_dungeons.822.t:0 "At Rock Bottom\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.822.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After an adventurous descent the time has come to understand what this chasm has to offer for us. Its promises are grand, and the allure of forgotten treasure drives the soldiers ever forward through the winding branches of this monument to nature's ingenuity. But even here the shaping hand is drawing its tracks through the dust of time. An ancient temple had been uncovered, an unmistakable sign that even down here there once were beings of sapience. What this means for us now is uncertain: Will we encounter whoever has made these structures or will the teeth of time have consumed everything and everyone by now?"
 diggy_dungeons.822.a:0 "Then let us go"

 diggy_dungeons.823.t:0 "Slimy Roots\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.823.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Walking along the paths carved out by time and nature yields many different sights into the very structure of what surrounds us, what we live in. Here we can see the sediments of ages past, relics of times immemorial, from before any life walked the surface of Hallann.\n\nBesides rock, however, there is also some plant life to be found down here. One of the most extraordinary specimens is a slimy root that pulses with a violet glow. Many are wary of it at first, but after one daring cook has tried it his mood lightens up. He plucks more out of the ground and distributes it, soon most of the expedition has their hands on the nourishing and invigorating plant."
 diggy_dungeons.823.a:0 "How tasty!"

 diggy_dungeons.824.t:0 "Rush to the Rocks\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.824.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The hostile environment of the chasm is by now well documented. Nobody questions anymore whether we would be able to safely traverse this region - the answer is no. Even now the very rock pitches itself against us, throwing whatever is at nature's hand against us. In a manic rush, the soldiers dash out of the way of an avalanche, falling rocks that would crush our very bones to pieces if we were to be subject to its thundering descent. Still, not everyone managed to outrun the rocks, some were buried under their grey uniformity. A tragic loss, a terrible omen to the beginning of our journey in the dark."

 diggy_dungeons.825.t:0 "Labyrinth\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.825.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We were ready for many things down here in the dark, but not this.\n\nBefore us are walls. Walls shaped by a knowing hand into the confines of a labyrinth. Its yawning opening beckons us inside, but fear has us stay out for now. Stories of fiendish presence in labyrinths are not unknown to us, and if there be any labyrinth that could house such a hellish abomination, why it would be this one, wouldn't it?\n\nBut there is another possibility. The walls reach high, yes, but not too high for our grappling hooks to reach the edge. We could, possibly, climb up the walls and traverse the labyrinth outside of its many walls."

 diggy_dungeons.829.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The path ahead was clear and straight, without any major problems. Only after some time did the walls of the labyrinth reveal cracks, and after the next corner, the passage was closed.\n\nThis did not stop us, with pickaxes we started demolishing the wall next to us. With the wall removed, we continued onwards into the next corridor. Strangely enough, some kind of hoarding creature must have made its lair here, for gold and gems lay strewn across the floor."

 diggy_dungeons.832.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The path to the right had shown no particularly interesting features until a cold breeze, like an icy storm, made its way into the corridor. With the air came a torrent of ghosts, a threatening display of grim morbidity, their ethereal visages display a hatred for the living and breathing.

The only advantage was that it was laid out plain in front of us.\n\nEventually a strange sight offered itself to us. In the distance stood a tower built atop the walls of the labyrinth, a rounded structure with a crooked roof. Spiderwebs filled the window frames and a hefty door sealed its insides off from us with nothing but a rusty lock preventing us from opening the door. With these two ways of entrance laid out before us, which should we choose?"

Although clearly connected to the other buildings around, the chapel has no obvious way to get deeper into the structure, the only door is locked and barred from the other side.\n\nAnother option, however, would be to drill a hole into the wall and try to get access to other parts that way, which could, potentially, be safer if we use the right tools.

 diggy_dungeons.841.a:0 "Brilliant!"

 diggy_dungeons.842.t:0 "Structural Un-Integrity\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.842.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The door flew wide open, but without the supporting structure, the wall itself gave in and broke apart, burying some of our men with it. The thunderous boulders smashed through other parts of the structure as well, creating a gaping hole in the floor. Through this hole, however, we can gleam a hidden stash of treasure amidst the rubble."
 diggy_dungeons.842.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite our best efforts the wall crumbled to pieces and broke down. In the torrent of rocks, many soldiers and workers got buried or smashed to pieces. The end, when the dust settles, reveals the true extent of the damage The path is clear, yes, but at what price? In other news, the rocks have revealed a stash of gold hidden behind the wall"
 diggy_dungeons.842.a:0 "At least it is some recompensation"

 diggy_dungeons.843.t:0 "A Church?\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.843.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Following our adventure at the tower we have come to a high-spired building that seems to be part of a church or some similar place of worship. It feels strangely out of place in the labyrinth, but the explorers are eager for the new challenge ahead.\n\nThe interior of the building is in a state of disrepair, parts of the ceiling had broken away and buried the room in rubble, which makes advancing through it a difficult task. Eventually, the rubble becomes too obnoxious to just pass over it, and it has to be carried away"
 diggy_dungeons.843.a:0 "Well, then get to it"

 diggy_dungeons.844.t:0 "Grand Hall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.844.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]This room is large and circular, a great banquet hall with old tables. One can imagine the livelihood of this place, but something feels amiss. The tables, the chairs, the walls, there is a strange air to them all.\n\nThe path ahead is blocked by another barricaded door, this time large boulders are keeping us away from continuing our journey. They are the size of horses or rothé, which will make this an arduous task to put them away."
 diggy_dungeons.844.a:0 "Let's start with this"

 diggy_dungeons.845.t:0 "Rubble: Removed\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.845.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The work with the rubble continues surprisingly fast and soon most of the boulders are away. The floor revealed is beautiful, intricate tile work hidden beneath the crude rock."
 diggy_dungeons.845.a:0 "What a great time we're having"

 diggy_dungeons.846.t:0 "An Eternity of Work\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.846.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The soldiers were initially high-spirited, but after hours and hours of work, they start getting annoyed. It seems as if they are making no progress at all, that they are mindlessly toiling away at a never-ending task."
 diggy_dungeons.846.a:0 "Oh, finally we are done"

 diggy_dungeons.847.t:0 "Door Unhinged\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.847.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The door and the barricades proved no big problem to us, the only thing it took us was a bit of time and strength, but nothing we can’t make up again. In fact, now that we are approaching the centre of this structure the soldiers get more and more excited for what is to come, what secrets they might unveil next."
 diggy_dungeons.847.a:0 "We're getting closer!"

 diggy_dungeons.848.t:0 "Ancient protections\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.848.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we were working on removing the barricades, suddenly the statues lining the walls began moving. Their eyes gleamed deep red, their granite weapons bent on removing the intruders, us, from the premises in one way or another. They approach us, their steps echoing through the hall and point spear and blade towards us.\n\nIn any other situation we would have easily defeated the golems, but for the work most people have laid down their weaponry, not expecting an attack. In the rough scramble to arms many were already cut down by the enemy, and only after some time did we manage to gain an advantage.\n\nEventually the golems were all destroyed, their rocks now the rubble preventing us from going further…"
 diggy_dungeons.848.a:0 "Back to moving rocks, I guess"

 diggy_dungeons.849.t:0 "The Sanctum\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.849.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At last we have reached the centre of this place, the locus from where the strange presence we have felt emanates. The inner sanctum of the church is furnished with exquisite pillars of intricate design, the altar is a true mason's beauty and the statue behind is large, imposing, yet aloof and oddly spiritual.\n\nIt depicts a worm-like creature surrounded by two fluted columns that curl inwards. At the worm's end lies the head, the shape of a broad cake slice, two small, beady eyes at the lower corner and elegantly snaking patterns growing to the edges. At the base, it tells its name: “The Ascended One”, an oddly fitting title since where else would one go from here? It is not possible to go deeper, up is the only direction.\n\nThen, suddenly, a laugh echoes through the chamber. From the statue exits a laughing ghost in the very image of the eidolon it was contained in. It yells “Ascend! Ascend! Ascend!”, before grabbing, or rather, incorporating the treasures piled high on the altar and flies away into the dark. "
 diggy_dungeons.849.a:0 "Hunt him down!"

 diggy_dungeons.850.t:0 "The Ghost Is Free\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.850.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The chasm's deepest point has been successfully explored, the task we have set ourselves has come to an end. But it is a bitter end, the ghost has vanished and with it the treasure we were so eager to call ours. We must now decide how to deal with this tragic loss."
 diggy_dungeons.850.a:0 "We must reach him!"

 diggy_dungeons.851.t:0 "Arduous Ascent\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.851.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the secrets of the chasm mostly uncovered it is now time to finish our business here. The ghost is still at large, harassing our soldiers here and there. We need to deal with it properly, or it might haunt other places as well. A new force was assembled to follow its ectoplasmic footsteps up the wall. “It is imperative,” the officials say, “that this nuisance is being dealt with”"
 diggy_dungeons.851.a:0 "Climb up after him!"

 diggy_dungeons.852.t:0 "Climbing Speed\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.852.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Luckily for us the wall had an easily accessible route upwards, a sloping stairway that leads along the cliff. Assisted by some climbing rope and using a piton here and there following the close almost on its heels. Only the continuous laughter and mocking screams of ascension from the ghost is working on our nerves."
 diggy_dungeons.852.a:0 "”You won't escape us!”"

 diggy_dungeons.853.t:0 "Difficult Terrain\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.853.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In an erratic dash towards the ghost flying up the wall the soldiers start slipping on small stones and pebbles, stumbling along the slopes, all in all slowing down the entire expedition. Those who fall have difficulty standing up again and over time the ghost fades more and more into the distance."
 diggy_dungeons.853.a:0 "Stand up and run, you fools"

 diggy_dungeons.854.t:0 "Cutting It Close?\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.854.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A decision suddenly manifests itself in front of us. The ghost, in his dastardly annoyance, flies along a manyfold edge that rises and falls along the wall. At the same time, there is another way along the wall that looks to be much more direct, a shortcut with which we could gain on him, but it is uncertain how the path will continue later."
 diggy_dungeons.854.a:0 "Let's be safe and follow him directly"
 diggy_dungeons.854.b:0 "We need every advantage we can get - take the shortcut"

 diggy_dungeons.855.t:0 "Cutting It Close: Around the Corner\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.855.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The scouts run after the ghost, following its erratic patterns while the rest of the expedition charts a path along the wall that leads them to where the ghost might be next. All in all this system works, sometimes the soldiers get closer, sometimes they fall a bit back, but the ghost remains in sight and couldn't slip away"
 diggy_dungeons.855.a:0 "Glorious pursuit"

 diggy_dungeons.856.t:0 "Cutting it Close: Cut Off\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.856.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The ghost has a distinct advantage, that being his ability to fly. While we have to take strange, winding paths through the rock, it can just fly up ahead, unbothered by the surrounding geology.\n\nOnly sometimes do we get a nice stretch where we can start gaining on him, but he is slowly slipping away, his laughter fading into the dark and stale air. At some point, this is the only thing we have left of him to follow, a difficult trace as echo and wall try to confuse us."
 diggy_dungeons.856.a:0 "We cannot allow to lose him"

 diggy_dungeons.857.t:0 "Cutting It Close: Close Call\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.857.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The shortcut turned out to be a great idea. The path led us to a cliff directly above the ghost, where we can watch it closely where it will go next. We are also managing to not only hold up with its speed, but also inch ever closer to its position"
 diggy_dungeons.857.a:0 "We're gaining on him!"

 diggy_dungeons.858.t:0 "Cutting It Close: Clear Paths\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.858.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We run around the corner and there is nothing. The shortcut has led to a big, gaping hole with the ghost nowhere to be seen. Just as the soldier's desperation almost got the better of them, the mocking laughter could be heard again, echoing around the chasm. The explorers grab everything they have and begin a mad dash in pursuit of the source of this sound."
 diggy_dungeons.858.a:0 "We should have gone directly after him"

 diggy_dungeons.859.t:0 "The Chase Continues\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.859.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The ghost is visible in the middle distance, making its way to a passage in the rocks. While we could simply run after it, we also have the option of bombing the support beams in order to collapse the ceiling and cut off the passage."
 diggy_dungeons.859.a:0 "Run after it!"
 diggy_dungeons.859.b:0 "Bring it down!"

 diggy_dungeons.860.t:0 "Cliff\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.860.d:0 "As we follow the ghost on its noncorporeal heels, we come upon a deep cliff. The ghost simply floats across the depths, but we will have to make use of the ancient-looking rope bridge spanning between the two sides."
 diggy_dungeons.860.a:0 "Walk carefully… but quickly."

 diggy_dungeons.861.t:0 "Lookout\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.861.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Having lost sight of the ghost, we quickly send some scouts to some higher places, hoping to still catch a glimpse of the thing. If we don't find it soon, we might not find it again, as it doesn't exactly leave tracks."
 diggy_dungeons.861.a:0 "See anything?"

 diggy_dungeons.862.t:0 Making Up the Distance\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.862.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Sprinting after the ghost, we manage to gain some distance on it, entering the passageway in only a matter of seconds after the ghost does."
 diggy_dungeons.862.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With several successful explosions, a part of the ceiling collapses, closing off the passageway the ghost was approaching. It is forced to turn back to a different exit, allowing us to make up some of the distance in the meantime."
 diggy_dungeons.862.a:0 "We're gaining on it!"

 diggy_dungeons.863.t:0 "Too Big a Boom\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.863.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With several successful explosions, a part of the ceiling collapses, closing off the passageway the ghost was approaching. It is forced to turn back to a different exit, allowing us to make up some of the distance in the meantime. As we go after it, though, the ceiling continues to crumble. As we reach the passageway, the rest of the ceiling collapses, killing the last few expedition members who had fallen behind."
 diggy_dungeons.863.a:0 "Run!"

 diggy_dungeons.864.t:0 "Not Fast Enough\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.864.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we try our best to keep pace with the ghost, our stamina is starting to give out. As we reach the passageway, panting and gasping for breath, the ghost is already nowhere to be seen anymore. We appear to have lost it."
 diggy_dungeons.864.a:0 "Expedition… over?"

 diggy_dungeons.865.t:0 "Across the Chasm\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.865.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With swift but careful steps, we quickly make it across the rope bridge. While certainly not as fast as the ghost, it was fast enough to keep it in sight, and continue the pursuit."
 diggy_dungeons.865.a:0 "Onwards!"

 diggy_dungeons.866.t:0 "Old Infrastructure\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.866.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With swift but careful steps, we quickly make it across the rope bridge. As the final few attempt to cross, however, the old ropes begin to snap. Several expeditionaries fall into the depths screaming, but we do not have time to look back lest the ghost gets away."
 diggy_dungeons.866.a:0 "We'll mourn later."

 diggy_dungeons.867.t:0 "Without a Trace\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.867.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With every passing second without word from the scouts, the situation gets more dire. As they all return with bad news, it is clear that the damned thing is lost forever."
 diggy_dungeons.867.a:0 "Expedition over."

 diggy_dungeons.868.t:0 "Stairway in Stone\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.868.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]To our great surprise, in front of us is a stairway that leads just up and ahead. An easy situation for our tired explorers, the stairs promise ease of use and a quick pursuit, a welcome exception to the arduous hunt so far. The rock itself is sturdy, the wall serves as a safe railing against which to hold, and the slopes are just good enough to promise safe steps."
 diggy_dungeons.868.a:0 "How convenient"

 diggy_dungeons.869.t:0 "At Road's Fork\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.869.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the cliff well behind us and the guest well before us we come to a crossroads. The ghost itself is nowhere to be seen at the moment, instead here is only the trail of ectoplasm, which runs exactly between the two paths, one leading up onto the cliff while the other leads along on the side of the wall."
 diggy_dungeons.869.a:0 "Walk along the cliff"
 diggy_dungeons.869.b:0 "Climb up"

 diggy_dungeons.870.t:0 "Vanish Into Thin Air\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.870.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]While we are running along the stairs the ghost suddenly vanishes from sight. Disheartened, but not willing to give up, the expeditionairies run for their lives to maybe catch the last glimpse of where the ghost might be headed next. Then, suddenly, the stairs stop. The expedition has reached the top."
 diggy_dungeons.870.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]During the hard climb we start to lose sight of the ghost, its ethereal form vanishing into unknown territory. Without much choice, we continue onwards, up and up, until suddenly the wall stops. In its place is a wide cavern. We have reached the top"
 diggy_dungeons.870.a:0 "Quick, we can't lose him now!"

 diggy_dungeons.871.t:0 "Ghost Ahead\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.871.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we had wished, the stairs have not forsaken us. After a calm yet urgent walk, we can see the top of the chasm coming up ahead of us. After months in the deep, the promise of a return to ground level has the expedition excited, a grand prospect of victory.\n\nWith the cliff crested and conquered we can see the ghost just ahead of us, pestering others for a change. But it means that our business is close to ending, the enemy is in plain sight."
 diggy_dungeons.871.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The climb was hard, but at last, we have crested the cliff and emerged on top of the chasm. Whether it be true or just a tick of the mind, the air seems fresher and more invigorating here. In addition to that, the enemy is now in plain sight, just a few paces in front of us the damnable creature is floating around, harassing others."
 diggy_dungeons.871.a:0 "GET HIM!!!!"

 diggy_dungeons.872.t:0 "ASCEND! ASCEND! ASCEND WITH ME!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.872.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At last we reach the summit, the highest point in the wall. To our chagrin the ghost has reached it just before us, now circling around - gods beware - another blasted statue of itself. His laughter and screaming exclamations of ascension have bothered our soldiers for long enough now, they ready all weapons they have at their disposal and ready themselves for combat."
 diggy_dungeons.872.a:0 "You're going DOWN!"

 diggy_dungeons.873.t:0 "Ascension Usurped\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.873.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Spells, swords, shields, and awards are readied against the ghost as it dives down and conjures spikes of silvery-white energy that he launches in circular patterns around it. These spikes pierce body and plate, they skewer us in many ways, but the ghost, Gorub, is not invincible. Slowly his form fades away and his voice grows weaker. In an act of desperation, it launches more and more spikes, but eventually, it runs out. With a last, desperate “aaascend…” it vanishes into thin air and leaves the package of gold behind."
 diggy_dungeons.873.a:0 "That is a lot of gold"

 diggy_dungeons.874.t:0 "Night Falls\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.874.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Our weapons are no match against the power of this ghost. In its mocking manner it launches piercing needles of energy against us, it rips through body and plate, and nothing can resist it. It laughs and mocks us, it floats around just out of reach until everyone has fallen victim to its devilish powers."
 diggy_dungeons.874.a:0 "All is dark"

 diggy_dungeons.875.t:0 "The Chasm Below, And Behind\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.875.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At last, there is silence in the chasm. No creatures, and especially no ghosts haunt the serene beauty of this geological wonder anymore. The expedition leader looks down in strange melancholy. Despite all the trials they had to endure, they have fallen in love with the place a bit. Although they could have done without the pesky ghost…"
 diggy_dungeons.875.a:0 "Oh, glorious end"
