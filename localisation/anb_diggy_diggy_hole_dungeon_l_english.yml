#Frogarsalforn, library of the ancients
 dd_frogarsalforn: "Frôgarsalforn"
 diggy_dungeons.100.t:0 "A Hidden Library?"
 diggy_dungeons.100.d:0 "Our populace celebrates the return of our most recent expedition. They are being heralded as heroes and given a proper, heroic welcome. But behind closed doors, far away from the ears of the common people, the expedition leader tells our administration something else, something more.\n\nDuring the expedition they have uncovered more than just trinkets and treasures: A crack in the wall has led them to a room with old books and strange runes. All of dwarvish make.\n\nAfter some research, the council has decided what this must be: A remnant structure from the old days of Aul-Dwarov, a library where the ancient dwarves have accumulated their knowledge."
 diggy_dungeons.100.a:0 "It is Frôgarsalforn, the Ancient Library"

 diggy_dungeons.101.t:0 "Frôgarsalforn: The Ancient Library\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.101.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rubbled walls and falling stones give way to an old entrance room, overshadowed by its ancient air. Dust has settled on the old dwarven walls, their inscriptions hidden beneath a grey mass illuminated by faint torches. Slowly the expedition steps into these halls of antiquity, tiny bones crumble under the heavily armoured soldiers' boots.\n\n''This is the place,” a sage explains. “This is Frôgarsalforn!”\n\nHe walks into the centre of the room, where the broken pieces of an orrery lie scattered across the floor. The base is covered in sticky webs of arachnid origin. These strands also extend beyond the room, covering up faint exits to the side. The grandest door, however, is not covered in webs, instead, it stands slightly ajar… "
 diggy_dungeons.101.a:0 "Clear the webs"
 diggy_dungeons.101.b:0 "Open the door"

 diggy_dungeons.102.t:0 "A Trove\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.102.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The passages with webs were cleared with no problems, the silvery-white strands now an amorphous mass on the ground. Hidden behind these once-homes lies the nest and breeding ground of the spiders. Gleaming among the remnants are old coins, gold and silver, as well as trinkets of dwarvish make, amulets and other, more exotic goods."
 diggy_dungeons.102.a:0 "Loot the webs"

 diggy_dungeons.103.t:0 "The Many-Legged Menace\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.103.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the webs jitter, their reverberations send signals to those who made them in the first place. From the passages spew forth the eight-legged monstrosities who now claim these hallways their home.\n\nAxe and blade against leg and mandible, the sudden fight overwhelmed the soldiers. Quickly they threw open the big door, hoping to find a safe haven deeper in the ancient structure."
 diggy_dungeons.103.a:0 "Get away!"

 diggy_dungeons.104.t:0 "The Reading Hall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.104.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rows upon rows of bookstands designate this room as the old reading hall of the library. It is not hard to imagine the dwarves of yore pondering their scrolls and stone tablets. In the centre of the room stands an effigy of erudition, a grand statue of a dwarf, book and scroll in his hands. The stone base is carved with runes.\n\n“All those who seek knowledge must know the ways to obtain it.”\n\n“A classic dwarven riddle,” one of the soldiers says. “It must have an answer hidden in this room.”\n\nThe explorers dispersed immediately, looking through the old rafters for clues. Eventually, an elder adventurer steps forth. “A library is a key to knowledge. What must we do to use a key? We must turn the pedestal!” he says.\n\nOthers seem more suspicious of his theory. They claim that turning over the statue itself might be the better idea."
 diggy_dungeons.104.a:0 "Turn it over - down with the statue"
 diggy_dungeons.104.b:0 "Turn the pedestal"

 diggy_dungeons.105.t:0 "The Key To Knowledge\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.105.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With rope and strength the statue keeled over, breaking loose from the base. As it fell to the ground, snapping noises echo through the room, followed by a low rumbling sound. The mechanism inside the statue had broken down, releasing the winch that held the hidden door in place.\n\nThe sound of bursting stone mixed with the creaking of stone sliding on stone as a door further into the library opened. Within the rubble, however, the explorers also found  some well-hidden gold. A thoroughly successful undertaking!"
 diggy_dungeons.105.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After considerable angular momentum was laid upon the statue it finally began to turn. Stone sliding on stone, groaning grains of particulate like flour seeping out of the joint, the mechanism inside the apparatus whirred to life. From within came the sound of a winch unwinding.\n\nSuddenly a hidden door on the other end of the room opened, effortlessly sliding open. In addition to that, a secret compartment within the statue itself opened, filled with gold."
 diggy_dungeons.105.a:0 "Good job, let's continue"

 diggy_dungeons.106.t:0 "Statue of Secrets\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.106.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As soon as the soldiers touched the statue it sprang to life, leaving its pedestal. It wielded the scroll akin to a sword, the book like a shield.\n\nThe soldiers were startled at first but caught themselves soon enough to mount a defence. The stone was old, however, and could not take much. The animated statue soon crumbled, but the magic power within burst in an arcane explosion, sending our forces  flying backwards."
 diggy_dungeons.106.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As soon as the soldiers touched the statue it sprang to life, leaving its pedestal.

 diggy_dungeons.107.t:0 "At Knowledge's Core\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.107.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Now the expedition enters the main library. High arches bend in strange ways, fractals invoking a strange feeling of familiarity in the soldiers. The fluted ceiling reaches up far above, with rows and rows of bookshelves lining the ascent.\n\nMost of the exits from this room have long been buried under the ages, but two hallways are still passable. To one side lies the old bookbinder's workshop, while the other leads to the paper mill. It is now up to the expedition leader to decide where to go next."
 diggy_dungeons.107.a:0 "To the bookbinder"
 diggy_dungeons.107.b:0 "We should try the papermill"

 diggy_dungeons.108.t:0 "Milling Goblins\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.108.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The paper mill is dominated by the gigantic axle emerging from the water wheelworks beyond the stone. Attached to it are the hammers that used to stomp on linen and rags to make the pulp that would eventually become paper.\n\nThey no longer work, instead, they are infested with a band of goblins that live in every nook and cranny of this manufactory. As soon as our soldiers entered the room the monsters descended upon them, claw, teeth and shoddy blades against our superior armaments."
 diggy_dungeons.108.a:0 "We'll show them!"

 diggy_dungeons.109.t:0 "Binder's Folly\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.109.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The bookbinder's rooms are small and cramped, with many strange turns around the furniture. It does not help that every nook and cranny seems to be stuffed with a group of orcs that have made their home here.\n\nFighting starts breaking out the moment one of our men enters the room. The orcish ferocity strikes fear into our soldiers, but they fight bravely. For now…"
 diggy_dungeons.109.a:0 "Give them no quarter!"

 diggy_dungeons.110.t:0 "Battered and Beaten\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.110.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins overwhelmed us by sheer number alone. Like a hydra, if you cut one goblin down, two are ready to take its place. Slowly we were driven back into the corners of the room, some unlucky groups circled in. Screams and warcries intermingle as both sides take losses, but it is our side who takes the brunt, and casualties mount."
 diggy_dungeons.110.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The orcs plough through our ranks, weaponizing the old tools of the trade against us. They throw the discarded equipment and turn over tables, all in their devastating offensive. Soon the front is littered with corpses. There are more of our men lying there than orcs, however, and those brutish specimens still have much fighting spirit left."
 diggy_dungeons.110.a:0 "We need to salvage this"

 diggy_dungeons.111.t:0 "Victory!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.111.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins posed no great threat, their weapons too weak to harm our armour. Soon they fled through the cracks, leaving the room to us."
 diggy_dungeons.111.d.2:0 "Despite their ferocious nature the orcs were unable to keep up their offensive, and before they could organize themselves we had already cut down a majority. The rest fled the halls, nowhere to be seen."
 diggy_dungeons.111.a:0 "Onwards!"

 diggy_dungeons.112.t:0 "Emergency System\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.112.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Old dwarven structures like these, located far away from other infrastructure, usually had automated defence mechanisms to repel invaders. During the disastrous battle, one such mechanism was discovered: An emergency offensive measure. But centuries have passed since its last maintenance. Will it still work?"
 diggy_dungeons.112.a:0 "It is our last option"
 diggy_dungeons.112.b:0 "We shouldn't risk it"

 diggy_dungeons.113.t:0 "The Return\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.113.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]When the first soldiers arrive back in the main room, they are startled by what they see. Our fighting must have alerted more and more enemies who now swarm the premises. All parts of the room are filled with our foes, all entrances blocked. We only have one choice left: Fight once again for our lives."
 diggy_dungeons.113.a:0 "One last stand"

 diggy_dungeons.114.t:0 "Aid of Yore\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.114.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The emergency system sprang to life, disgorging dwarven security automata upon our enemies. The whirling constructs cut deep swathes into our enemies and obliterated them, leaving us free reign over the region."
 diggy_dungeons.114.a:0 "Those dwarves knew what was up"

 diggy_dungeons.115.t:0 "Backfire\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.115.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The system was working -- but in the worst way possible. The automatons attacked everything in sight, even our men, reducing the entire room to rubble.\n\nSoon nothing was left except a single soldier that had been straggling behind, who now had the terrible task of reporting this failure to his superiors."
 diggy_dungeons.115.a:0 "What a terrible idea"

 diggy_dungeons.116.t:0 "Retreat\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.116.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Instead of risking the old dwarven mechanism, the expedition leader signalled a retreat. Quickly the troops gathered and made their way out of the library, leaving the rooms and treasures behind with heavy hearts.\n\nBack in the capital [Root.Monarch.GetName]was not impressed either but understood what had to be done. Now we tend to our wounded and plan for the next time."
 diggy_dungeons.116.a:0 "We'll try again next time"

 diggy_dungeons.117.t:0 "Corpses upon Corpses\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.117.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The last missive reaching the capital was that a fight had begun in the main hall. Then nothing. Diviners have tried to discern what had happened. Their result: Total annihilation. The expedition has failed."
 diggy_dungeons.117.a:0 "next time"

 diggy_dungeons.118.t:0 "Towards a Bright Future\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.118.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their superior numbers we have managed to kill enough of our enemies to scare them into fleeing. As the hall clears out we survey and try to salvage what we can. Many walls are now completely broken down, but that has also revealed more chambers that were previously inaccessible. There we found old records and treasure that were still mostly intact, a great success for our expedition!"
 diggy_dungeons.118.a:0 "Take what you can"

 diggy_dungeons.119.t:0 "Glorious Return\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.119.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition returns, treasure and knowledge in hand. They are heralded as heroes and share the tales of their experiences with the eager ears of our populace."
 diggy_dungeons.119.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 diggy_dungeons.120.t:0 "Beyond the Premises\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.120.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the main rooms of the library cleared out and in various states of repair, one of the construction crews reports of a break-in that revealed a zig-zagging chasm into the dark depths of the mountain. After some first inspections we were attacked by a small fighting force of goblins, armed with weapons of higher quality than initially expected. Quickly the defences were rallied so that construction would not be hindered.\n\nAfter some fighting the goblins were either killed or fled back into the dark, but the chasm clearly posed a serious security hazard. After much discussion the decision to send another expedition into the library was deemed reasonable, and a new force of explorers were sent out to brave its halls.\n\nArriving at the point of the break-in, the expedition leader reviews and takes stock of her men and  supplies. But even as this proceeded, screams could be heard from the dark below. Faint lights appeared in the depths, quickly drawing nearer. The soldiers readied their weapons against the approaching foe, readying a defense against a tunnel in the wall."
 diggy_dungeons.120.a:0 "We will stand united"

 diggy_dungeons.121.t:0 "The Sword is Stronger Than the Claw\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.121.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins arrived in manageable waves, trickling into the room in small groups. They were mostly disoriented and confused as to what exactly was happening. This meant that our soldiers had no trouble keeping the enemy at bay, although the waves got stronger towards the end. Then, as suddenly as they appeared, the goblins stopped coming through, leaving the path ahead clear."
 diggy_dungeons.121.a:0 "A great start to our endeavour"

 diggy_dungeons.122.t:0 "Broken Wall, Broken Shields\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.122.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins crashed through the hole in the wall in an unending tidal wave, goblin after goblin disgorging from the stone wound. Our soldiers were slowly and steadily driven back, each line of defence falling almost as soon as they were erected. Then, after a bloody back and forth, the goblins retreated back into the dark. The path is clear, but the price was high."
 diggy_dungeons.122.a:0 "Not the best start, but a start nonetheless"

 diggy_dungeons.123.t:0 "Gazing Into the Abyss\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.123.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The chasm stretches deep below, its yawning dark beckons those at the precipice. Some soldiers are uneasy already, mentioning some strange force numbing their senses.\n\nBut the expedition leader must determine how to best approach the chasm.\n\nQuickly two options stand out. The chasm has repeating platforms and terraces protruding from the walls, which could be secured and made walkable, adding safe waiting spots, but at a high cost to our supplies. The other possibility is to use winches from the library construction to rope the soldiers down one by one."
 diggy_dungeons.123.a:0 "Secure the platforms"
 diggy_dungeons.123.b:0 "Just rope down"

 diggy_dungeons.124.t:0 "The Way Down\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.124.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At first the plan with the ropes worked out. One by one the soldiers touched down on the floor of the chasm, but towards the end the winches began creaking under the constant strain, and the rope itself started degrading. Then, piece by piece, the mechanism broke, sending many men falling to their deaths, destroying supplies and other important equipment."
 diggy_dungeons.124.a:0 "It all comes crashing down"

 diggy_dungeons.125.t:0 "The Abyss Gazes Back\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.125.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The terraces proved to be too unstable to safely traverse. Rocks breaking loose left and right sent equipment flying into the unknown dark, with only the sound of shattering tools reaching us. Our pitons and ropes managed to catch our men, thankfully,  so that we did not lose any of our crew. Despite the havoc, we did  all reach steady ground again, able to go on."
 diggy_dungeons.125.a:0 "Salvage what we can and continue"

 diggy_dungeons.126.t:0 "Descension\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.126.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With pitons and rope, strong pickaxes and sturdy spikes we managed to get down through the chasm with no problem whatsoever. In fact our morale improved after that first encounter with the goblins. Songs were sung, it all felt more like a stroll through the mountain instead of a dangerous descent."
 diggy_dungeons.126.a:0 "The climbing gear was worth the money"

 diggy_dungeons.127.t:0 "The Horde\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.127.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Walking along the bottom of the chasm instilled a strange mood in the explorers. Often the scouts would see something in the pitch-black dark, only for it to be a false alarm. The sound of scurrying claws dragged across stone echoed through the walls. There was something in the dark, just no one knew where it was exactly.\n\nIt all happened so quickly. From one second to the other the goblins descended upon us. Flashing teeth and claws, discarded swords and broken shields in their hands, they attacked us before the scouts could sound the alarm."
 diggy_dungeons.127.a:0 "Fight for your lives!"

 diggy_dungeons.128.t:0 "Brought Low In the Dark\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.128.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their sudden appearance our soldiers quickly rallied around our banners. Fighting from those steady formations managed to repel most of the greenskins. Some managed to get through the defences nonetheless, but reinforcements from other parts of the battle could bolster the ranks again.\n\nAs the goblins lost their superiority in numbers they started retreating up the walls from whence they came. A quick survey of the damages showed that there had been some casualties, as expected, but overall the battle was a resounding victory."
 diggy_dungeons.128.a:0 "The path is clear"

 diggy_dungeons.129.t:0 "Decimation\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.129.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Just as quickly as it began it ended. After decimating our troops the goblins retreated into the dark again, seemingly content with what damage they had caused. Our medics now tend now to the wounded that can still be helped, and the surgeons patch up whatever they can. Many have fallen, far too many, but going back now is no option."
 diggy_dungeons.129.a:0 "We must go on"

 diggy_dungeons.130.t:0 "A Warband In the Deep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.130.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The past days had been quiet and fruitful. The cartographers managed to map out most of the lower levels, and our prospectors had even found some promising veins of ore, although nothing major.\n\nBut this soon changed with the echo of orcish war cries. The explorers knew immediately what would happen: A warband was roaming the chasm, and scouts soon reported that they were swiftly closing in . Our forces quickly took defensive positions, and just in time, as with unparalleled ferocity the orcs soon descended upon us."
 diggy_dungeons.130.a:0 "We will prevail"

 diggy_dungeons.131.t:0 "An Eventual Triumph\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.131.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their ferocious nature, the orcs turned out to be not quite as dangerous as we had believed. The winding paths in this chasm meant that they could not attack in a full frontal assault and had to trickle into the battlefield. In the end the drawn-out battle ended in our favour, with the warband dispatched and destroyed."
 diggy_dungeons.131.a:0 "Very good"

 diggy_dungeons.132.t:0 "Overrun\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.132.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Charging into our defences from the front and from the sides, through hidden tunnels in the walls, the orcs rushed over us like a wave, cutting down everyone and everything in their path. Terrified screams of pain could be heard echoing from the walls, the gurgling of blood, and war cries of orcs.\n\nDespite our losses, we gave as good as we got, and eventually destroyed the warband -- but at a staggering price."
 diggy_dungeons.132.a:0 "A costly victory, but a victory nonetheless"

 diggy_dungeons.133.t:0 "The Underboss\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.133.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Our expedition has arrived at the end of the chasm. Over the past days goblin presence has become stronger and stronger, with many skirmishes here and there.\n\nBut now they stand in front of a rackety wooden castle clearly brimming with goblins. Floor by floor they cut themselves through until they arrive at the central chambers. There a large goblin sits on a throne of bones, wearing a shoddy crown. The soldiers have not yet been noticed, and so there is the opportunity to defeat this monster with brains, not just with brawn."
 diggy_dungeons.133.a:0 "Make a trap"

 diggy_dungeons.134.t:0 "Incarceration\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.134.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The trap is set and the expedition waits in the shadows. Eventually, the Boss leans back in his throne when the rackety cage falls down on him. This was the sign for the soldiers to come in and attack their helpless foe. Soon, all that is left of the Boss is a corpse."
 diggy_dungeons.134.a:0 "May you rot down here"

 diggy_dungeons.135.t:0 "Unhidden\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.135.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]During the construction of the trap our troops were suddenly overwhelmed by a patrol of goblins who immediately sounded the alarm. Within seconds the Boss was alerted and threateningly flourished his club at us.\n\nHis face was filled with a strange mixture of hate and glee, his teeth yellow-red against his dark green skin. We must be defensive if we wish to survive this encounter."
 diggy_dungeons.135.a:0 "The best defence is a good offence! Charge!"

 diggy_dungeons.136.t:0 "Blood and Bile\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.136.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the end all it took was a single sword plunged deep into the Boss' throat. Like a fountain of fresh springwater, blood and bile spilled out of his body, his bloated skin sagging down into a puddle of fat."

 diggy_dungeons.137.t:0 "Terror in the Deep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.137.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Goblins pour out from the walls. The Boss' club quakes the earth. One by one our men are slain. In the end only I remain. I can still hear them searching for me. They get closer. I can see the fire of their torches. Here. They. Come."
 diggy_dungeons.137.a:0 "A terrible end"

 diggy_dungeons.138.t:0 "The Home Stretch\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.138.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the threat of the Boss dealt with we can declare the chasm to be safe again. As we return to the library, however, new ideas for security measures are being drafted. Most importantly: seal off the chasm. Soon construction workers put their strengths to use and start patching up the wall, hopefully without another problem…"

 diggy_dungeons.140.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Just as construction began on the wall, one last swarm of goblins came out from the chasm below. Their shrieking was made up from threats of vengeance and promises of death. They fought recklessly, until the very last one dropped dead.

 diggy_dungeons.141.a:0 "An excellent expedition!"

 diggy_dungeons.142.t:0 "A Deeper Vault?\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.142.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]For the past months, construction work had been going swimmingly and many parts of the library could be used by our scholars already. The workers laboured on their periphery, fixing things up here and there. Recently, however, some scribes have reported strange noises near one of the lower floors. The initial investigation had gone nowhere with the inspector saying nothing was there.\n\nComplaints did not end, however. Over the next weeks, more and more people complained about noises and even missing books. At this point, the chief librarian had heard enough. Clearly, something was amiss, and he called for a new expedition into the library.\n\nWith the force assembled the expedition leader took stock of the situation. Together with a few scouts he surveyed the perimeter and a particularly perceptive peer provoked peculiar proceedings: Behind one of the shelves could be heard the rattles of a door swinging in a draft. He pushed the shelf aside, revealing an entrance into a deeper part of the library. From the dark corridor, the sound of wood bumping against wood echoes out."
 diggy_dungeons.142.a:0 "Follow the sound"

 diggy_dungeons.143.t:0 "Collapsing Shelf\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.143.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition leader gathered the soldiers and headed into the corridor. The strange sound became louder and clearer as they entered a high-vaulted tunnel with ruined bookshelves left and right. Suddenly some of the shelves started falling in on each other, threatening to bury the expedition under books and splinters."
 diggy_dungeons.143.a:0 "Get away!"

 diggy_dungeons.144.t:0 "Broken Door\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.144.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The barricade, it turned out, was useless. Just as the soldiers had finished erecting it, the door  burst open, revealing a horde of goblins behind, rushing forward and clambering over the defenses."
 diggy_dungeons.144.a:0 "Great job, everyone…"

 diggy_dungeons.145.t:0 "Secure Passageway\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.145.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the door safely barricaded no one can get through, and the passage should be safe to any intruders. This means, however, that in order to follow up on the strange occurrences the expedition has to find another path.\n\nAfter some time one of the scouts returned with great news: she has found another way into the deeper library! Not only that but this path must have been dug by a xorn or a similarly creature with corvidian instincts: gems and gold were laid in hoard just a few minutes walk into the tunnel."
 diggy_dungeons.145.a:0 "What a fortunate find"

 diggy_dungeons.146.t:0 "Under Books\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.146.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The shelves cave in left and right, bending under their own weight. Each shelf, in turn, brings its neighbour to fall as well in a gigantic cascade of books and wood falling like boulders in an avalanche."

 diggy_dungeons.147.t:0 "Over Books\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.147.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In a strange fit of luck and skill the books did not harm any of our expedition. The shelves either stopped halfway from crashing down or got stopped by the shelf across the passage, forming a strange  roof-like structure. Some books did fall down, but by far not as threatening an event as the whole shelf would have been."

 diggy_dungeons.148.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins rushing out of the tunnel quickly met a bitter end on the tips of our spears and lances. Almost one by one they ran into our formation making this battle a piecemeal. In the end, a large pile of goblins lay in front of us. Shovelling them aside proved indeed to be the greater of the two challenges…"

 diggy_dungeons.149.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the force of a bomb goblins spilled out of the tunnel, completely overwhelming our troops. The crude weapons cut nasty wounds that went deep under the skin.\n\nAs our vanguard began to fall one of our commanders saw an opening in the goblin's assault. He signalled an almost orderly retreat forward into the Library, escaping the goblins with most of the men still alive."

 diggy_dungeons.150.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Orderly rows of desks stand side by side, the signs of age draped over them like soft cloth. Dust swirls up with every step the expedition takes. Ever so slowly books move in their shelves, first shifting and shuffling around, then hovering through the still air to accumulate into a large clump with vaguely humanoid features - limbs and something that could be considered a head, more a bump extruding from the main accumulation. Despite its almost peaceful formation, this monster -- book golem? --  now seems focused on ploughing through our troops, hurling streams of books towards us."

 diggy_dungeons.152.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With heavy shields it was no problem to guard against the flurry of books flying towards us.

 diggy_dungeons.153.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At first it felt very stupid, but volume by volume we exhausted the creature's bibliography.

 diggy_dungeons.154.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Like trolls trying to catch flies our soldiers aimlessly try to catch the books, failing miserably. Their clumsy jumps make them fall over while books keep on bashing them.\n\nEventually the creature seems to be exhausted, having buried most of our expedition under piles of books and dissipated. Slowly the soldiers wriggle out again. None had died, but they had been deeply demoralised."

 diggy_dungeons.155.t:0 "The Stash\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.155.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The room opening up now was more of a cave than a proper room akin to those we had encountered previously. Large limestone deposits hung menacingly above heaps and heaps of gold coins, minted all those ages ago in Aul-Dwarov. They bear the likeness of those dwarf-lords of old and there still is a glint in their age-wizened eyes.\n\nMeanwhile the eyes of our soldiers seem to be not wise at all. Their joy about this grand discovery soon turned into a lust for the riches. All over the cavern people started divvying up the gold -- despite the expedition charter specifically saying that all loot would go into the coffers, not to the individual soldier."
 diggy_dungeons.155.a:0 "There is no reason to get overly excited, okay?"

 diggy_dungeons.156.t:0 "Completely Lost\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.156.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]One of the soldiers looks up from the campfire. “Where are we?” A simple question but it struck a very specific string with the rest of the expedition. Indeed, where were they?\n\nFor days, nay, weeks, the expedition had roamed the tunnels with no clue as to where they were actually heading. Soon voices started appearing that questioned the authority of the expedition leader, and demanded we focus on finding a way home."
 diggy_dungeons.156.a:0 "Search around to find some direction"

 diggy_dungeons.157.t:0 "Utter Loss of Control\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.157.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]All attempts at calming down the soldiers came to an end when even the expedition leader became afflicted by the cursed gold. As he descended upon the group of infighters he bludgeoned his way towards the coins, escalating the discussions into a full-blown fight.\n\nEventually the fighting stopped as the grim realisation set in what had happened. A senseless massacre that, in the end, benefitted absolutely no one. As the explorers settle down for the night there is a long silence in the camp. Those who fought were shunned by those who had resisted the urge, creating a dark emotional barrier within the camp. In the end it was decided that this gold should be left alone, that it would be too dangerous to bring it back."

 diggy_dungeons.158.t:0 "A Calming Presence\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.158.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The discussions and arguments slowly escalated into small brawls over particularly large and heavy coins. Even with people trying to calm down others nothing seemed to really work. Only after the booming voice of the expedition leader echoed through the room did people realise what was happening. One by one they began to calm down and began loading the coffers with the gold. They would still have a bad temper for the next few days, but eventually the horrors of the gold were behind them."

 diggy_dungeons.159.t:0 "Knowledge Elemental\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.159.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The last days had been marked by monotonous journeys through samey hallways and book-laden rooms. There was talk about being lost, but there were distinct signs of progress. Then the strange visions began. Soldiers would start babbling nonsensical stuff, quoting entire passages of books they had read once, or maybe never read at all. Some would start drawing maps of strange places, reciting poetry or arcane formulas. Then, there would be quiet for some time, then there would be outbursts again.\n\nAfter the third time a soldier quoted from “Lugnut's Treatise on the Strange Rumorations of What Lies Beyond the House of the Riddling Sun of Rubaa and How Kitling Would Not Recognize Her Mother” the expedition leader had enough. He called a large meeting to discuss what was going on.\n\nAfter some lively discussion (and one of the lieutenants telling the story of some elf in Cannor nobody had ever heard of) there was a consensus. They were haunted not by a ghost, but by a much stranger enemy: A knowledge elemental. Memory made real. But how would one even fight such an apparition?"

 diggy_dungeons.160.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Luckily for the expedition leader he had ordered the search just in the knick of time.

 diggy_dungeons.161.t:0 "Another Wrong Turn\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.161.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After three days of search it becomes painfully obvious: There is nothing here. They are in some insignificant part of the Serpentspine, with only insignificant rock around them.\n\nEventually, the expedition leader admits his failure. In a speech to the soldiers he addresses the confusions of the past weeks, which calms some of the more radical members, but is not helpful regarding general morale."

Only if the elemental has no host would it manifest as a proper creature that could be attacked. With the decision made, the enforcers went to business.\n\nWhenever the “visions” would begin in someone they were taken out, until suddenly the elemental appeared, a strange airborne creature cloaked in runes and whirling around. In this form, however, it was almost powerless and could do no real harm. A well-placed fireball finally got rid of it."

 diggy_dungeons.164.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Finally we have arrived at the centre of this affair. Hidden behind devious arcane traps and dangerous bookshelves lies a circular room with a high, domed ceiling. At its focal point stands a stone plinth with strange runes across its perimeter. From the runes rises a translucent figure emitting faint light in erratic bursts.\n\n“A living spell!” a mage says. Indeed, this new enemy is a living spell, magic made substantial. All of its power is bent on a single purpose: To expel foreigners, to safeguard the library. It has bested our attempts so far but its end is nigh!"

A stream of molten lava scattered with remnants of piping dictates that the most direct path is along its banks.

 diggy_dungeons.500.t:0 "A Gate In The Dark"
 diggy_dungeons.500.d:0 "For what seems like days the expedition has been travelling down, into the bowels of the earth. Down and down following what was once a spiralling stone staircase, now a smooth slope of stone worn by the passage of time and countless feet. The only sounds are the echoing of footsteps and clattering of supplies as each man concentrates on keeping his balance. So preoccupied are the men that they hardly notice it until they're mere feet away - a great gleaming set of steel doors set into the stone wall. The doors are pristine, intricately engraved and polished, so bright in the torchlight that after days of exploration in low light they are difficult to look at directly. Surrounding the doors are an intricate set of gears and levers, beautifully crafted and apparently free of debris.\n\nA cleric squints at the runes repeated across the doors, mouthing them aloud as he translates. "Grumhardhûm, it reads Grumhardhûm'' he calls out. At this, a ripple passes through the gathered expeditionaries. Many have heard stories of the legendary forge of Grumhardhûm, said to have armoured every hero and high king of Aul-Dwarov. It was often rumoured that craftsmen in Grumhardhûm lived for two lifetimes, as a lifetime of expertise was necessary to even be granted the privilege of working there. Few believed the legends referred to a real place, and of those none thought it may still be intact in any form millennia after the fall of Aul-Dwarov. Rumours and stories spread through the gathered men like wildfire, eventually forcing the leader of the expedition to intervene to restore order. Many wish to attempt to enter the forge now, or at least crack open the doors to glimpse the wonders inside. However, the men are tired and lacking supplies - as much as it pains the leader too, he knows they must return home for now. If the wonders of Grumhardhûm have survived until now, they can wait for one more expedition."
 diggy_dungeons.500.a:0 "We'll be back."

 diggy_dungeons.501.t:0 "Open The Gates\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.501.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Upon reaching the end of the maze of tunnels and the winding staircase marked on the map, the scouts suddenly stop. As the rest of the expedition pushes past them, it becomes clear why. Before them stands the great steel gate of Grumhardhûm, still resplendent and majestic as it was when it was abandoned, just as the previous expedition had reported. Filled with hope that the great forge had been spared the destruction that befell all else in the Serpentspine, several forward scouts attempt to push the great doors apart to gain entry. Soon there is a line of men pushing upon the doors in unison, but to no avail - the gate remains still and silent."
 diggy_dungeons.501.a:0 "Strike the gears and pry the gate open!"
 diggy_dungeons.501.b:0 "Perhaps the gears can be greased back into service…"

 diggy_dungeons.502.t:0 "Engineering Built To Last\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.502.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With one last push, and barely a whisper, the great gates swing open and the expedition hurries inside. As the gate closes behind the last man, everyone relaxes. The finely crafted doors are still unblemished and will provide a bulwark against any creatures attempting to sneak in from the rear. Beyond the threshold, the walls of the entrance corridor are covered in pipes and more carvings, but unlike the door these are blackened by soot and grime. The floor is likewise filthy, littered with metal and bone scraps, the unmistakable signs of a goblin infestation. Grimly but resolutely, the expedition moves towards the flickering orange light that illuminates the end of the corridor."
 diggy_dungeons.502.a:0 "Is it hot in here, or is it just me?"

 diggy_dungeons.503.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Frustrated by an hour of no progress, a mage pushes through the throng of men around the gates and attempts to blast them open. As their spell connects a horrific grinding and shearing of metal upon metal echoes around the caverns, and the expedition instinctively covers their ears and cowers. By the time they look up the once great gates have fallen, now a bent and twisted heap of metal. As the expedition steps over the remains and moves into the forge, the mood is sombre. Each expeditionary mourns the loss of the great gates, not just for their artisanry but also for the defence from rear ambushes they would have provided. Their hopes are further crushed as they see the floor littered with metal and bone scraps and the carvings on the wall defaced by soot, the signs of a goblin infestation. Not wanting to dwell on the gates any longer, the expedition makes haste towards the flickering orange light illuminating the end of the corridor."
 diggy_dungeons.503.a:0 "I think I feel a draft from behind…"

 diggy_dungeons.504.t:0 "The Great Forge\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.504.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition approaches the end of the corridor, the temperature continues to rise. Soldiers sweat and shift in their heavy armour, looking enviously at the airy robes and simple leather armour afforded to others. Rounding a corner and entering the forge proper, a cavernous circular room bathed in the orange light opens up before them. Magma flows and drips from pipes running the length of the room, running to and from a great pit in the centre of the room. So wide is the pit that, combined with the heat haze present, nobody can see across it to the other side clearly. Some of the braver scouts venture to the edge, peering over it to see a great cauldron far below, suspended by huge chains with each link thicker than a man's torso. There are also simple metal elevators hanging haphazardly below, intended to bring workers to levels below this one, but they appear to be stuck and are out of reach for now. The floor is strewn with soot and debris - all kinds of metal, bone, cloth and food scraps lie everywhere. Looking up, a giant dome is far above, funnelling steam and other vapours into a huge hole at the apex. In the shadow cast by the dome, rusty metal scaffolding and rickety ladders lead to nooks populated with glowing unblinking eyes. Equidistant around the walls are carved stone doorways leading into miscellaneous rooms and antechambers, some with dedicated pipes serving them.\n\nAs the scouts return to report what they saw to the rest of the expedition, one steps upon a discarded sheet of pig iron. A screech of alarm rings out and a ruddy brown arm grabs their ankle - there was a feral goblin sleeping underneath it! Abandoning caution, the scouts sprint back to the main party as more goblins pour from the surrounding rooms and from around the pit. There is barely enough time for the expedition to close ranks around the scouts before the goblins crash into them."
 diggy_dungeons.504.a:0 "Hold the line!"

 diggy_dungeons.505.t:0 "The Unbreakable Shield Wall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.505.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Using the narrow entrance corridor as a chokepoint, the feral goblins' charge was quickly broken upon the expedition's shields and spears with few casualties from the defenders. As the remaining goblins turn tail and flee it becomes apparent that the goblins' fallen brethren have brought quite a haul. Most of them were kitted in crudely modified armour and wielding weapons sourced from inside the forge - even after so many years of misuse, these pieces are still finely crafted and would fetch a high price from collectors."
 diggy_dungeons.505.a:0 "Ugh, this chestplate still has half a goblin in it."

 diggy_dungeons.506.t:0 "A Feral Goblin Tide\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.506.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The relentless flood of feral goblins overwhelmed the wall of shields and the expedition scattered, fleeing back down the corridor towards the entrance. By the time the expedition leader had rallied the troops for a counterattack to drive off the goblins, many of the more unfortunate men lay dead and trampled upon the floor in exchange for a pitifully small number of feral goblin lives. The dead are dragged solemnly into the entrance corridor to be retrieved later and the expedition continues as best it can."
 diggy_dungeons.506.a:0 "What a waste of lives…"

 diggy_dungeons.507.t:0 "Beasts Everywhere\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.507.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the immediate danger past, the expedition huddles together in an antechamber near the entrance to plan their next move. The untouched levels below are tantalisingly close, but they cannot continue until all the remaining squatters have been eradicated. The mages and scouts of the expedition present the leader with options for which to deal with first.\n\nHigh above, they have identified the eyes in the shadowed nooks and occasional echoing cries as those of giant cave bats. These bats are even larger than normal and what little of them can be seen has a distinctive reddish tint, leading several mages to suggest they may have been mutated by the residual magics of the forge. If the swarm is not dealt with swiftly, a careless action could bring them down upon the expedition.\n\nSomewhere on the same level as the expedition is the lair of the feral goblins that first assailed them. The remains of the feral goblin charge will have retreated there for safety, as the strongest goblins will be lounging about in the comfort of the lair. The lair will also contain the feral goblin clanboss' choice of loot scavenged from the forge. Cleansing the feral goblins will reward the expedition with these spoils, but it is impossible to know yet just how many lurk within the lair.\n\nLastly, a platform hangs between this level and the next surrounded on all sides by pipes. Judging by the various valves, dials and levers, the area was used to control the flow of liquids through the many pipes in the forge. Most of the controls are in disrepair and those that appear serviceable are covered by magma leaking from weakened pipe junctions. If the flow of magma to the upper levels can be disabled, it will prevent further dangerous leaks from the pipes above. Again, the mages caution that the unstable magics of the forge are likely to have spawned magma oozes wherever magma leaks, but these cannot be separated from regular magma without closer inspection."
 diggy_dungeons.507.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition regroups in the antechamber, leaning against walls and pillars for a well deserved rest. In the meantime, the expedition leader is again presented with the potential options to clear the remaining beasts."
 diggy_dungeons.507.a:0 "Bring down the giant bats!"
 diggy_dungeons.507.b:0 "Cleanse the feral goblin lair!"
 diggy_dungeons.507.c:0 "Splatter the magma oozes!"
 diggy_dungeons.507.e:0 "The beasts are cleared, let's examine the elevators."

 diggy_dungeons.508.t:0 "The Bats Above\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.508.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the antechamber a debate rages among the expedition about how best to handle the bats. "One fireball and the whole swarm will be set alight" argues a trigger-happy mage, "we won't even have to fight them!" This idea is quickly vetoed by the leader of the scouts "Are you crazy? You'll bring the whole scaffold down on us!" Before the mage can snap a response, he continues "besides, this whole place is hotter than a dragon's armpit. Those bats probably eat magma for breakfast… What if your fireballs make them stronger? Then we'll be fighting giant flaming bats!" After several more minutes, the expedition leader steps in to make the final decision - no fireballs. As some of the less disciplined mages sulk, he organises a group of armoured soldiers and light archers to face the bats, leaving the rest of the expedition to hunker down in the antechamber and wait.\n\nThe plan is simplicity itself. The soldiers will stand in a loose square around the archers, ready to protect them from any swooping bats. As of now the swarm has not been alerted so the first strike is the key to the whole operation. The archers have been instructed to aim for the glowing eyes in the darkness, calling out their target's position quietly to ensure no bat is targeted twice. Once all the archers have identified a target they will fire on the lead archer's mark, hopefully killing or disabling most of the swarm before they can even get close. Even without their great numbers the remaining bats may still be dangerous, as their leathery wings have been known to deflect arrows and chip swords. Still, so long as everyone remains calm the casualties should be kept to a minimum."
 diggy_dungeons.508.a:0 "Take aim…"

 diggy_dungeons.509.t:0 "The Goblins Lair\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.509.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Following the trails of blood left by the feral goblins, the expedition's scouts have located the lair. It sits in a room almost antipodal to the entrance, hidden by the heat haze over the central pit. The entrance has been repeatedly smashed and broken, enlarging it enough for more than 6 men to walk through shoulder to shoulder. The adjoining chambers have also had their doorways battered, inner walls collapsed and windows barricaded with sheet metal, creating a rather spacious lair protected from most of the heat of the forge. As the scouts watched, several dead feral goblins were brought from the lair and unceremoniously hurled into the central pit - no doubt their clanboss was angered by their failure to crush the expedition. Unfortunately, with the windows blocked the scouts were unable to ascertain how many goblins remain in the lair or where they store their loot.\n\nDespite the lack of information on their numbers, the expedition leader decides to carry out the strike immediately. Right now the goblins will be bickering and fighting over who should take the blame for their previous attack's failure, and who should risk their life to try again. If they can be caught off guard while trapped in their lair their looted equipment and possible numeric advantage will be completely nullified.\n\nHugging the walls of the forge chamber to remain undetected, the expedition approaches from both sides of the lair simultaneously. At the front are mages escorted by a small retinue of soldiers. On the leader's mark the mages will blast fireballs into the lair, summon flashes of light and plumes of smoke, and generally attempt to disorient all the goblins inside. Any goblins rushing out of the lair for reprieve will be swiftly cut down, and once the mages are spent the main body of the army will enter the lair to mop up the remains. As the leader begins counting down with hand signals a loud belch emanates from the lair doorway. Daring not to breathe, the whole expedition watches powerlessly as a cave troll lumbers out of the doorway. It turns to the side lazily, meeting the leader's gaze uncomprehendingly. As its eyes widen and it raises the misshapen hunk of metal it carries with both hands, the leader desperately cries "Now! Attack now!""
 diggy_dungeons.509.a:0 "Quickly, aim for the eyes!"

 diggy_dungeons.510.t:0 "The Magma Below\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.510.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Unsurprisingly, none of the expedition are keen on being sent down to the magma-covered platform hanging in the pit. After a quick drawing of lots, a small group of soldiers are chosen to accompany a water mage and an engineer down to the platform to attempt to disable the flow of magma. Sending too many men risks the weakened and overheated supports breaking, and so the remainder of the expedition can do nothing but watch as the group is lowered on chains to the platform. As the first soldier touches down on one of the few magma-free spaces, two magma oozes leap at them from the surrounding magma! Only a quick burst of water from the mage above him keeps them from engulfing him, and they are visibly shaken as the oozes recoil back into the safety of the magma.\n\nThe next few minutes are much the same - the group makes painfully slow progress across the platform, clearing pools of magma and dodging magma ooze ambushes as best they can. As they reach the dense tangle of pipes with controls, the engineer suddenly cries out "I can see the emergency shutoff pipes, but the valves are broken! I can't close them!". There is little time to make a decision - the water mage is visibly exhausted and out of mana potions, and several of the group have already perished to the oozes. If the valves can be repaired and the flow of magma arrested then the magma oozes on the platform will be severely weakened, perhaps enough to save the brave men down there. Though, their situation is already pretty dire… what's the worst that could happen if the group is simply allowed to perish?"
 diggy_dungeons.510.a:0 "You've made it this far, you can do the rest alone."
 diggy_dungeons.510.b:0 "Quickly, throw him whatever he needs to repair the valves!"

 diggy_dungeons.511.t:0 "Broken Elevators\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.511.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the surrounding beasts cleared and the expedition out of danger for now, interest in exploring the lower levels of the forge is reignited. The elevators once used to travel between floors hang below, their chains tangled and rusted. Many of the elevators are missing platforms and guardrails and some have come loose altogether, barely visible laying battered and broken deep in the pit. In this state the expedition leader would be hard pressed to find a single man willing to travel down using these, let alone a whole expedition.\n\nAfter several hours of examinations with telescopes and attempts to untangle the elevators with blasts of air, the engineers have come up with a plan. Though most of the elevators are not worth fixing, a group of larger freight elevators have been preserved in good condition and have swung free from the debris binding them thanks to the efforts of the mages. Unfortunately, the brakes are still deployed on each elevator and their chains have been greatly weakened by the friction as the elevators slipped further and further down over time. If these elevators are hauled up intact, the only major repair required is the replacement of the length of chain that hung above the elevators. However, the engineers caution that the new chain must be of sufficiently sturdy metal or the next elevator to fall may take half the expedition with it.\n\nAmid the rhythmic cries of "Heave, Ho!" as the men haul the elevators up, the expedition leader considers his options. The expedition has small stores of steel, iron and bronze reserved for mending armour and emergency structural repairs. In a pinch, these could be fashioned into remarkably sturdy chains. Alternatively, the metal scraps strewn across the forge could be used instead - after all, they were good enough for the old dwarves of Grumhardhûm."
 diggy_dungeons.511.a:0 "Fetch me our emergency metal supplies!"
 diggy_dungeons.511.b:0 "Gather up what scraps you can."

 diggy_dungeons.512.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Unfazed by the screeching cries of the bats, the archers identified their targets in mere minutes. Like a well-oiled machine, they fully draw and hold their arrows in unison for a few agonising seconds. As the cry of "Fire!" rings across their ranks, a cloud of arrows sails gracefully up, piercing countless bats. The remaining bats shriek and swoop, their fangs sharper and hide tougher than expected, but with their numbers so thin casualties from the expedition are left few and far between. While tending to the wounded, a cleric notes that many bats were killed with a single shot through their eye, leaving their unusual reddish hide intact. This unique, fire resistant pelt will be of interest to many a craftsman back home."

 diggy_dungeons.513.t:0 "A Weak Grip On Life\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.513.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Tension grows as the occasional echoing calls from the bats become a near constant screeching, interfering with the archers' signals. As unease spreads through the ranks and soldiers instinctively inch closer for safety, an archer falters and looses their arrow early. For a moment, only the sound of the arrow whistling through the air is present. Then a flurry of claws and fangs descends, soldiers on the flanks are swept off their feet and the remaining archers fire blindly into the swirling thicket of wings and fur. Minutes later as the last bat hits the floor with a wet thud, what remains of the archers and soldiers regroup and trudge back to the antechamber."

After recovering from the initial chaos a small squad led by a mage managed to lure the troll to the edge of the pit. Their bodies lie down there with the troll now, to be retrieved by a later expedition. Seeing their troll fall broke the will of the remaining feral goblins and they were easily mown down by the reinvigorated expedition soldiers. The panicked spells cast at the beginning of the operation destroyed much of the loot lying out in the open in the lair. As those searching the lair despair, an engineer discovers a hidden compartment at the back behind a makeshift throne of iron. Inside is all manner of decorative metal artefacts - goblets, candlesticks, ceremonial swords, the list goes on."

Only when one mage managed to launch a fireball into its gaping maw was the troll finally felled. The troll's corpse lies half-inside the lair, which was completely caved in by the explosions and the mammoth weight of the dead troll. Luckily for the fleeing expedition members, the collapse killed almost all of the remaining goblins. Unluckily, what treasures the feral goblins had collected were crushed and buried too."

There's a horrible creaking sound and as the magma inside the pipes cools and expands, the weakened pipes suddenly explode! The shrapnel shatters the chains of the platform, sending it plummeting towards the bottom of the pit, and strikes many of the expedition crowded around the edge watching the party. Though they have sustained many injuries and the volunteer party is lost, the flow of magma seems to have stopped. Even better, the oozes seem to have absorbed gemstones and chunks of metal from their time in the pipes, making much of the shrapnel stuck in the injured and dead very valuable."

Far above, the increased pressure from closing the emergency valves has pushed the pipes past their breaking point. As the expedition scrambles to get clear of them, they explode, showering unlucky expedition members with magma and shrapnel.

 diggy_dungeons.520.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the squatters cleared from the top level of the forge and the elevators repaired, the entrance to the great forge has been made safe for now. The lower levels yearn to be explored and once again some of the more foolhardy men vie to be the first to set foot below in millenia. Many brave soldiers were lost to the beasts and many more supplies were spent along the trip. The expedition is also burdened with loot, so much that the expedition leader would have to seriously consider leaving any further treasures behind. The decision is made to retreat for now, returning to the surface to resupply. The expeditionaries will be glad to be free of the cloying heat and eerie emptiness for a time. Those that have set foot in the Grumhardhûm will be back though, as the inexorable pull of the forge draws all kinds."

 diggy_dungeons.521.t:0 "A Peculiar Message\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.521.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition once again passes over the threshold of Grumhardhûm, the familiar heat of the forge hits them. This time, most of the expedition members have stowed the heavy armour they wore through the caves in favour of lighter leather and hide armour. Some mages have even procured magical armour engraved with temperature controlling runes, much to the jealousy of the other members. Many survivors of the last expedition have returned as expected, eager to see what hides in the lower levels that were made accessible by their previous efforts.\n\nSince the last expedition some small exploratory parties have braved the journey to the lower levels to scout ahead. All turned back quickly from the heat, unsettled by the unnatural emptiness of the cavernous forge. Their efforts were not in vain, however, as the last party noticed a peculiar stack of engraved metal plates on the lower levels near an elevator. Some of these plates were scattered around as well and they appear to have all originally been identical. The plates are all melted, dented, torn or scratched in different places - no fully intact plate exists. The engraving is clearly some form of runic script, but deciphering the whole message is difficult. Additionally, the back of some of the plates holds a different engraving. With the least damaged plates spread out on the floor, learned members of the party puzzle over what the original message could be."

 diggy_dungeons.522.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After almost an hour of pondering a cleric speaks up with his translation. According to him, it's part of an old dwarven love poem passed around to boost morale among the workers, reading "Do not let the father's tears quench your burning heart, and let nobody label your feelings." For a moment, there is only stunned silence among the expedition. Then a soldier cuffs him over the head, "idiot, this is the Grumhardhûm, not the tunnels of Ovdal Lodhum!" After several more hours of bickering, the expedition is no closer to the true meaning of the plates and thus the expedition leader calls for them to move on."

 diggy_dungeons.523.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After much deliberation and etymological debate, some of the message is pieced back together. The rear of the plates are too damaged, but the message on the obverse has been successfully translated. It's a stern reminder to the workers of Grumhardhûm that they must not become complacent, reading "It is required to read the labels and consult the supervisor before manipulating any controls". The consequences of not doing so must have been dire if they committed to engraving and handing out all these plates, so the expedition leader decides to take one with them to remind the expedition too."
 diggy_dungeons.523.a:0 "We may have some trouble consulting a supervisor, though."

 diggy_dungeons.524.t:0 "Our Ancestor's Message\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.524.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Translating the words of their ancestors is a common practice for dwarves, even more so since they began reclaiming their ancestral holds. With this experience the expedition quickly deciphers both sides of the old dwarven message. The obverse is a stern reminder to the workers of Grumhardhûm that they must not become complacent, reading "It is required to read the labels and consult the supervisor before manipulating any controls". The message on the rear is a notice to workers, reminding them what they should do if the great furnace beneath the forge was to ever go out. It reads "Allow the tears of the father and the fire of the mountain to flow into the furnace". The expedition commits these translations to memory, as if these messages were important to their ancestors then they must be important to them too."
 diggy_dungeons.524.a:0 "To think, even the workers of Grumhardhûm needed reminders."

 diggy_dungeons.525.t:0 "Beneath The Cauldron\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.525.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition travels slowly down the repaired freight elevators, they take in the sights surrounding the huge cauldron of the great forge. Metal rings of flooring similar to the top level surround the cauldron at different heights. Great pipes lead to and from the cauldron and smaller vats, forges, smithing stations and carved chambers on each floor. These floors are much better preserved and have not been infested by squatters, owing to the difficulty of reaching them. Still, the squatters managed to despoil the lower floors with rotting bodies and trash left lying near the edges of the floors and piled up in the great cauldron, thrown into the central pit with no care for the destination. Soot blankets the floors and walls of each level, crunching underfoot and leaving ugly black stains behind. Below the huge cauldron on the bottom floor lies a fine mesh, still smouldering and belching strange vapours. The great furnace below has not completely extinguished even after millenia of disuse, leaving the whole of Grumhardhûm swelteringly hot. Some engineers of the expedition shudder, imagining working here when the furnace was still at full blast.\n\nOnce the repaired elevators touch the bottom floor for the first time, the expedition's scouts dart off to explore the depths of Grumhardhûm. A ring of engraved steel surrounds the mesh on the bottom floor, though it is difficult to see through the ankle-high piles of dust, bones, soot and metal scraps that have collected over time. A rough stone tunnel is the only exit in the walls of the bottom floor, in line with the entrance gate far above. The scouts who entered the tunnel return blackened with soot and panting for breath. They descended in a gentle sloping spiral, approaching the smouldering furnace beneath the mesh. Their exploration was halted by magma pouring lazily from cracks above and in the walls, covering the huge steel bridge in front of them. As far as they could tell the bridge is still intact but the magma must be cleared to gain access to the furnace.\n\nAfter reviewing the structure and pipeworks of the forge, the engineers of the expedition have determined the magma blocking the bridge should be flowing into the furnace below. Something is blocking the pipes into the furnace and causing an overflow of magma. How the forge is still smouldering without the heat from the magma is unknown, but irrelevant for now. Judging by the inscriptions that remain on each level the penultimate level is the best bet to clear the magma. Somewhere on that floor are the controls to manage the flow of magma, and water used to generate steam, into the furnace below. The scouts look to the expedition leader, wondering where to search first."
 diggy_dungeons.525.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition exits the chamber, returning to the soot-strewn penultimate level of the forge. Everyone settles down, leaning against walls and pipes to catch their breath as best they can in the sweltering heat of the forge. After just a few minutes of respite, the expedition leader calls out the order to begin exploring the opposite side of the floor."
 diggy_dungeons.525.a:0 "We will explore the rooms on the left side."
 diggy_dungeons.525.b:0 "We will explore the rooms on the right side."

 diggy_dungeons.526.t:0 "Complex Controls\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.526.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The left side of the penultimate level is home to a series of small control chambers. All these chambers were once almost identical, containing pipes rising up from the floor and into the ceiling of each, adorned with various valves and levers. Now the control chambers are a spectrum from almost untouched to no more than a pile of rubble in a doorway. Unfortunately the inscriptions above each room have long since worn away, making it difficult to tell what purpose even the intact control rooms serve. After a fruitless search for any more clues to each room's purpose, the expedition leader dispatches an engineer and a mage to the bottom floor. With a combination of divination and mechanical knowledge, they locate the pipes buried in the rock that run to the furnace and follow them back up into the chamber that controls them.\n\nAt first it appeared that the expedition was out of luck - the chamber the engineer pointed to was one full of rubble. After a little excavation, however, it was clear that the rubble was from the partial collapse of only one wall. With some improved braces a further collapse is prevented, and once the rubble is cleared out the expedition leader can walk through the open path into the control chamber. Mercifully, the pipes and controls were not touched by the collapse and are still mostly intact.\n\nThere are only three controls on the pipes, a pair of iron valves surrounding a strange reddish lever. The valves were once coloured too - there are small flecks of paint still stuck to the rear of them. It seems that the left valve was once a peculiar light green, while the right valve was a deep yellow colour. Aside from the pipes running up the back wall and these controls, the room is an empty uniform cube only large enough for a handful of people. Alone in the room for now, the expedition leader ponders his options."

 diggy_dungeons.527.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The right side of the penultimate level has only a smattering of carved antechambers, all of which have collapsed and are inaccessible. Unusually, there's a large carved stone tunnel as well. It's long but narrow, with smoothly curving walls and tipped with a simple stone staircase leading upwards. Curiously the air in the tunnel is comparatively cooler and pleasantly humid, more akin to a beach holiday than a desert trek. The scouts sent into the tunnel are forced to return soon, however. The flickering orange light from above the staircase and the chaotic magic energies swirling in the tunnel can only mean one thing - an infestation of magma oozes.\n\nThe cool air means there is very little magma in the tunnel, so each ooze should be comparatively weaker than the ones experienced on the first floor. Still, the tunnel is far too narrow for a large force to enter, whereas the amorphous oozes will have no problem utilising their numbers. Ignoring the men clamouring to stand in the refreshing draft, the expedition leader begins selecting a team to clear the tunnel."

The flow has relented somewhat, leaving sections of the bridge clear enough for the expedition to pass through, but magma still pours from above and pools upon the bridge. The bubbling, roiling pool of magma that has collected beneath the bridge is uncomfortably close, leaving the bridge hot enough to burn skin on contact. Despite these adversities the expedition leader makes the decision to push on while the bridge is somewhat passable. As scouts move ahead, examining magma pools for waiting oozes and clearing magma as best they can, the expedition follows."
 diggy_dungeons.528.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition has clearly had some effect on the flow of magma that once covered the steel bridge into the furnace.

Even so, it is not trivial to understand - it reads "Those from Ovdal Lodhum finish last. He of Grôzumdihr moves before he of Verkal Gulan." Given the number of control rooms and the bizarre wording of the inscription the cleric had suggested it functioned as a mnemonic for the dwarves working here, though he could not decode it himself.

Overcome by competitive spirit, they neglect to check the roof, allowing several oozes to squeeze through a small crack and drop upon the mages in the back. Caught out while drinking their mana potions in a quiet moment the mages are helpless to defend themselves.

The sound is similar to that of a sea swell, as though something huge is moving below the magma under the bridge. By the time most of the expedition realises the danger, the scouts are too late to run back to safety. The expedition leader watches helplessly as a gigantic magma ooze surges around both sides of the bridge under the scouts.

Light flickers strangely off ore seams and the walls seem to close in as they keep advancing. The heat grows and grows until the expedition is walking through a visible heat haze, with many mages reporting visible magical distortions as well. Finally, a huge pair of doors are illuminated before them. These are similar to the doors at the entrance of the Grumhardhûm, but they show signs of being hastily barricaded from this side. Steel bars, sheets of iron and other makeshift materials have been bolted and welded to the gates and hastily carved inscriptions and wards cover the whole door. Evidently, despite the forge being abandoned in a hurry, the inhabitants were gravely concerned about whatever was behind that door.\n\nThis is the last straw for the expedition leader. Many of the expedition are at risk of passing out from the heat, with mages reporting nausea and dizziness from the chaotic magical energies swirling before the doors. He knows that in this state even a flock of bats would pose a serious challenge, let alone whatever is sealed behind those doors.

It appears that once a great underground river flowed through the cavern, slowly carving peculiar channels into the rock. The sound of flowing water still echoes down the cavern, but a bronze dam blocks the river. The dam stretches most of the way up to the cavern ceiling, with four great gates lined along the base. These four gates are open, but clogged with debris from upstream, leaving the underground riverbed bone dry. Scouts sent to climb the dam report that there's a bubbling stream on the other side, not quite large enough to fill the whole cavern even with the dam open. At the other end of the underground riverbed, the floor suddenly drops and huge pipes snake off in different directions to deliver water to the forge.\n\nIt seems that the dam gates were once controlled mechanically, as they are far too heavy to be operated by hand.

After a truly herculean effort from every member the ooze suddenly broke apart, returning to an inert pool of magma and slipping from the bridge. Now, as the expedition leader takes stock of those who have survived, he notices a battered steel chest covered in weakly glowing runes left behind on the bridge.

The wards on the doors were powerful, still weakly flickering after so long, but have been nullified. The inscriptions hastily scrawled across the door are an epithet, repeated in several ancient scripts including old dwarven. "They all roughly mean Old Fire Lord, Aldorlbûr in the forge's native dwarven", explains a linguist brought along to examine the doors. A noble with such a title doesn't appear in any ancient chronology, though it hardly matters as any living being would have perished after so long locked inside the furnace. As the last bars are torn from the doors they swing open eerily of their own accord, revealing the top of a scorched steel staircase.\n\nA blast of hot stale air from inside the doors washes over the waiting expedition members. The heat throughout the forge has worsened since the previous expedition cleared the magma from the bridge into the furnace, but this extra heat is the final straw. Everyone stumbles back from the doors hoping to escape the dry heat licking at their bodies. Ignoring the orders of the expedition leader, most of the men continue to retreat back as far as they can from the doors and towards the comparatively cooler forge.\n\nWith the whole expedition gathered before the bridge again, the mood is low and many wish to turn back before even entering the furnace.

The muffled sound of water breaking against the gates is audible as they approach. These are clearly floodgates, each ready to be lifted by two thick chains in an emergency. This situation certainly qualifies, but the system of levers and pulleys that once held the chains have been left a twisted wreck. The expedition leader has no choice but to send men to hold the bare chains, with naught for leverage but their muscles. They will need to hold the floodgates up for as long as possible to maximise the amount of water to the emergency pipes. Volunteers line up on alternating sides of each chain, wrapping their hands with whatever they can for protection.

Suddenly great gouts of water burst from a pipe and douses those on the nearest chain. This shock breaks those men's concentration, with their floodgate crashing back down just seconds later. The other floodgate soon follows, leaving the volunteers gasping on the slick cavern floor. They did more than enough - water rushes through the pipes surrounding them and a growing pool of water spreads through the cavern.

Also on the platform are groups of high powered water jet cannons. They are in disrepair, cracked and dripping oily fluid onto the platform, but do not look unfixable. Having men manning these cannons from such a vantage point would be invaluable. Thus, a group of engineers are dispatched to climb the slippery ladder and repair the cannons - they must also hunker down and remain undetected until the time is right, or they risk being cooked alive by the fire elemental before making so much as a drizzle."

Then Aldorlbûr tears through the pipes on the flank of the expedition like no more than paper, effortlessly incinerating those closest. As the expedition members cry out and lunge for safety, it pauses rather than pressing on and instead circles around. Is it toying with the expedition, or genuinely wary of them? It matters not, as the torn pipes open a new escape route for the expedition. Escaping unscathed from the elemental while it is so close will be difficult, especially as it becomes inured to such a strategy. Still, surely it's a better option than rushing to a fiery demise?"

Aside from some minor scratches and burns, the runes are pristine but nevertheless mostly inactive. The floor surrounding the cage is much different, bearing deep scorch marks and gouges. Discarded pieces of armour have been welded to the floor by the heat and are surrounded by piles of ash, the remains of whatever unfortunate souls surrounded Aldorlbûr when it escaped. The wards must have been extremely powerful to keep the elemental imprisoned for so long and to sustain such little damage as it ravaged the area as revenge. If the mages can repair the minor damage and provide enough mana to the wards again, the cage should be capable of suppressing the fire elemental even when it is at nearly full power.

Though each of Aldorlbûr's attacks are blindingly quick they also open the fire elemental to counterattack while their fiery body is stabilising again. It is difficult to ignore the desperate cries of those Aldorlbûr has left badly burned but there is nothing the expedition's medics can do until the fire elemental is clear. Wary of overextending, both the expedition and Aldorlbûr circle each other, making occasional probing attacks. If physical attacks do any lasting damage to Aldorlbûr is unknown, so instead these serve as a distraction for mages to strike. It has been struck with various spells and projectiles by now, but unfortunately very little water. The elemental dances and dodges around even a drop of water, evaporating it or hurling pipes at it rather than meeting it with its body. This fear is easily exploited to create openings, but the unlucky person who sent the water is usually targeted and incinerated by the elemental soon after. After what feels like hours, the fire elemental is finally beginning to show signs of weakness. Its body no longer burns so painfully bright and its attack range and speed have lowered noticeably.\n\nIn a stroke of luck, a brave mage blasts a jet of icy water at Aldorlbûr right as it rears up for another attack. Unable to dodge, the water strikes its centre mass and this time it visibly recoils with a horrible shriek. The mage is reduced to ashes soon after, but the damage has been done. Clearly rattled by such a hit, Aldorlbûr is now squarely on the defensive. It no longer initiates attacks, opting instead to slip and weave away from all projectiles, waiting for men to overcommit. Focusing entirely on defence makes the elemental near untouchable - after some time of this with precious few hits it begins to regain confidence, apparently unaware of the expedition's true plan. Hoping to corral it back towards the cage to seal it back for good by utilising its newfound wariness, the expedition have been carefully guiding Aldorlbûr with their attacks.

Aldorlbûr waits cruelly, letting them exhaust themselves and those around him burn to death in agony.

Yet the accursed mortals that invaded its cavern stubbornly defy its flames, refusing to submit. At first Aldorlbûr was glad to have new playthings, but they now behave more like an insect buzzing incessantly about its head.

As a last ditch effort, Aldorlbûr abandons its form and looses fiery tendrils to all corners of the room and ceiling searching desperately for an escape. Hacking at the living fire with swords and dousing it with water weakens the tendrils, which flicker, then disappear completely. Reduced to nothing more than a fist sized orb of fire, Aldorlbûr is jerked back into the runic cage as the front swings shut with a conclusive crash.\n\nThe triumphant expedition still lays upon the floor hours later, completely exhausted from their efforts. Before them Aldorlbûr seethes inside the runic cage, trapped again for the foreseeable future. With the whole of the Grumhardhûm cleared and free of danger and the ancient source of heat sealed once again the complete reconstruction of the forge can begin in earnest. Well, another group can head down to the furnace to do the repairs in earnest - the expedition members will be looking forward to their pay and a nice long vacation somewhere cool after this harrowing experience."
 diggy_dungeons.570.a:0 "Truly, a cage fit for a lord."

 diggy_dungeons.571.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]"There!" exclaims the lead engineer as he turns the last valve with a flourish. Immediately the sprinkler directly above blasts the floor around them with foul water, and he scrambles to turn the valve back off as unlucky expedition members around him are splashed. At least now they know the sprinklers certainly work - and with unexpected force! Activated at the right time, they will be a great boon against Aldorlbûr."
