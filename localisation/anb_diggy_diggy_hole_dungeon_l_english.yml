#Frogarsalforn, library of the ancients
 dd_frogarsalforn: "Frôgarsalforn"
 diggy_dungeons.100.t:0 "A Hidden Library?"
 diggy_dungeons.100.d:0 "Our populace celebrates the return of our most recent expedition. They are being heralded as heroes and given a proper, heroic welcome. But behind closed doors, far away from the ears of the common people, the expedition leader tells our administration something else, something more.\n\nDuring the expedition they have uncovered more than just trinkets and treasures: A crack in the wall has led them to a room with old books and strange runes. All of dwarvish make.\n\nAfter some research, the council has decided what this must be: A remnant structure from the old days of Aul-Dwarov, a library where the ancient dwarves have accumulated their knowledge."
 diggy_dungeons.100.a:0 "It is Frôgarsalforn, the Ancient Library"

 diggy_dungeons.101.t:0 "Frôgarsalforn: The Ancient Library\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.101.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rubbled walls and falling stones give way to an old entrance room, overshadowed by its ancient air. Dust has settled on the old dwarven walls, their inscriptions hidden beneath a grey mass illuminated by faint torches. Slowly the expedition steps into these halls of antiquity, tiny bones crumble under the heavily armoured soldiers' boots.\n\n''This is the place,” a sage explains. “This is Frôgarsalforn!”\n\nHe walks into the centre of the room, where the broken pieces of an orrery lie scattered across the floor. The base is covered in sticky webs of arachnid origin. These strands also extend beyond the room, covering up faint exits to the side. The grandest door, however, is not covered in webs, instead, it stands slightly ajar… "
 diggy_dungeons.101.a:0 "Clear the webs"
 diggy_dungeons.101.b:0 "Open the door"

 diggy_dungeons.102.t:0 "A Trove\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.102.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The passages with webs were cleared with no problems, the silvery-white strands now an amorphous mass on the ground. Hidden behind these once-homes lies the nest and breeding ground of the spiders. Gleaming among the remnants are old coins, gold and silver, as well as trinkets of dwarvish make, amulets and other, more exotic goods."
 diggy_dungeons.102.a:0 "Loot the webs"

 diggy_dungeons.103.t:0 "The Many-Legged Menace\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.103.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the webs jitter, their reverberations send signals to those who made them in the first place. From the passages spew forth the eight-legged monstrosities who now claim these hallways their home.\n\nAxe and blade against leg and mandible, the sudden fight overwhelmed the soldiers. Quickly they threw open the big door, hoping to find a safe haven deeper in the ancient structure."
 diggy_dungeons.103.a:0 "Get away!"

 diggy_dungeons.104.t:0 "The Reading Hall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.104.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rows upon rows of bookstands designate this room as the old reading hall of the library. It is not hard to imagine the dwarves of yore pondering their scrolls and stone tablets. In the centre of the room stands an effigy of erudition, a grand statue of a dwarf, book and scroll in his hands. The stone base is carved with runes.\n\n“All those who seek knowledge must know the ways to obtain it.”\n\n“A classic dwarven riddle,” one of the soldiers says. “It must have an answer hidden in this room.”\n\nThe explorers dispersed immediately, looking through the old rafters for clues. Eventually, an elder adventurer steps forth. “A library is a key to knowledge. What must we do to use a key? We must turn the pedestal!” he says.\n\nOthers seem more suspicious of his theory. They claim that turning over the statue itself might be the better idea."
 diggy_dungeons.104.a:0 "Turn it over - down with the statue"
 diggy_dungeons.104.b:0 "Turn the pedestal"

 diggy_dungeons.105.t:0 "The Key To Knowledge\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.105.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With rope and strength the statue keeled over, breaking loose from the base. As it fell to the ground, snapping noises echo through the room, followed by a low rumbling sound. The mechanism inside the statue had broken down, releasing the winch that held the hidden door in place.\n\nThe sound of bursting stone mixed with the creaking of stone sliding on stone as a door further into the library opened. Within the rubble, however, the explorers also found  some well-hidden gold. A thoroughly successful undertaking!"
 diggy_dungeons.105.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After considerable angular momentum was laid upon the statue it finally began to turn. Stone sliding on stone, groaning grains of particulate like flour seeping out of the joint, the mechanism inside the apparatus whirred to life. From within came the sound of a winch unwinding.\n\nSuddenly a hidden door on the other end of the room opened, effortlessly sliding open. In addition to that, a secret compartment within the statue itself opened, filled with gold."
 diggy_dungeons.105.a:0 "Good job, let's continue"

 diggy_dungeons.106.t:0 "Statue of Secrets\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.106.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As soon as the soldiers touched the statue it sprang to life, leaving its pedestal. It wielded the scroll akin to a sword, the book like a shield.\n\nThe soldiers were startled at first but caught themselves soon enough to mount a defence. The stone was old, however, and could not take much. The animated statue soon crumbled, but the magic power within burst in an arcane explosion, sending our forces  flying backwards."
 diggy_dungeons.106.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As soon as the soldiers touched the statue it sprang to life, leaving its pedestal.

 diggy_dungeons.107.t:0 "At Knowledge's Core\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.107.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Now the expedition enters the main library. High arches bend in strange ways, fractals invoking a strange feeling of familiarity in the soldiers. The fluted ceiling reaches up far above, with rows and rows of bookshelves lining the ascent.\n\nMost of the exits from this room have long been buried under the ages, but two hallways are still passable. To one side lies the old bookbinder's workshop, while the other leads to the paper mill. It is now up to the expedition leader to decide where to go next."
 diggy_dungeons.107.a:0 "To the bookbinder"
 diggy_dungeons.107.b:0 "We should try the papermill"

 diggy_dungeons.108.t:0 "Milling Goblins\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.108.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The paper mill is dominated by the gigantic axle emerging from the water wheelworks beyond the stone. Attached to it are the hammers that used to stomp on linen and rags to make the pulp that would eventually become paper.\n\nThey no longer work, instead, they are infested with a band of goblins that live in every nook and cranny of this manufactory. As soon as our soldiers entered the room the monsters descended upon them, claw, teeth and shoddy blades against our superior armaments."
 diggy_dungeons.108.a:0 "We'll show them!"

 diggy_dungeons.109.t:0 "Binder's Folly\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.109.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The bookbinder's rooms are small and cramped, with many strange turns around the furniture. It does not help that every nook and cranny seems to be stuffed with a group of orcs that have made their home here.\n\nFighting starts breaking out the moment one of our men enters the room. The orcish ferocity strikes fear into our soldiers, but they fight bravely. For now…"
 diggy_dungeons.109.a:0 "Give them no quarter!"

 diggy_dungeons.110.t:0 "Battered and Beaten\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.110.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins overwhelmed us by sheer number alone. Like a hydra, if you cut one goblin down, two are ready to take its place. Slowly we were driven back into the corners of the room, some unlucky groups circled in. Screams and warcries intermingle as both sides take losses, but it is our side who takes the brunt, and casualties mount."
 diggy_dungeons.110.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The orcs plough through our ranks, weaponizing the old tools of the trade against us. They throw the discarded equipment and turn over tables, all in their devastating offensive. Soon the front is littered with corpses. There are more of our men lying there than orcs, however, and those brutish specimens still have much fighting spirit left."
 diggy_dungeons.110.a:0 "We need to salvage this"

 diggy_dungeons.111.t:0 "Victory!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.111.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins posed no great threat, their weapons too weak to harm our armour. Soon they fled through the cracks, leaving the room to us."
 diggy_dungeons.111.d.2:0 "Despite their ferocious nature the orcs were unable to keep up their offensive, and before they could organize themselves we had already cut down a majority. The rest fled the halls, nowhere to be seen."
 diggy_dungeons.111.a:0 "Onwards!"

 diggy_dungeons.112.t:0 "Emergency System\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.112.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Old dwarven structures like these, located far away from other infrastructure, usually had automated defence mechanisms to repel invaders. During the disastrous battle, one such mechanism was discovered: An emergency offensive measure. But centuries have passed since its last maintenance. Will it still work?"
 diggy_dungeons.112.a:0 "It is our last option"
 diggy_dungeons.112.b:0 "We shouldn't risk it"

 diggy_dungeons.113.t:0 "The Return\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.113.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]When the first soldiers arrive back in the main room, they are startled by what they see. Our fighting must have alerted more and more enemies who now swarm the premises. All parts of the room are filled with our foes, all entrances blocked. We only have one choice left: Fight once again for our lives."
 diggy_dungeons.113.a:0 "One last stand"

 diggy_dungeons.114.t:0 "Aid of Yore\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.114.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The emergency system sprang to life, disgorging dwarven security automata upon our enemies. The whirling constructs cut deep swathes into our enemies and obliterated them, leaving us free reign over the region."
 diggy_dungeons.114.a:0 "Those dwarves knew what was up"

 diggy_dungeons.115.t:0 "Backfire\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.115.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The system was working -- but in the worst way possible. The automatons attacked everything in sight, even our men, reducing the entire room to rubble.\n\nSoon nothing was left except a single soldier that had been straggling behind, who now had the terrible task of reporting this failure to his superiors."
 diggy_dungeons.115.a:0 "What a terrible idea"

 diggy_dungeons.116.t:0 "Retreat\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.116.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Instead of risking the old dwarven mechanism, the expedition leader signalled a retreat. Quickly the troops gathered and made their way out of the library, leaving the rooms and treasures behind with heavy hearts.\n\nBack in the capital [Root.Monarch.GetName]was not impressed either but understood what had to be done. Now we tend to our wounded and plan for the next time."
 diggy_dungeons.116.a:0 "We'll try again next time"

 diggy_dungeons.117.t:0 "Corpses upon Corpses\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.117.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The last missive reaching the capital was that a fight had begun in the main hall. Then nothing. Diviners have tried to discern what had happened. Their result: Total annihilation. The expedition has failed."
 diggy_dungeons.117.a:0 "next time"

 diggy_dungeons.118.t:0 "Towards a Bright Future\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.118.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their superior numbers we have managed to kill enough of our enemies to scare them into fleeing. As the hall clears out we survey and try to salvage what we can. Many walls are now completely broken down, but that has also revealed more chambers that were previously inaccessible. There we found old records and treasure that were still mostly intact, a great success for our expedition!"
 diggy_dungeons.118.a:0 "Take what you can"

 diggy_dungeons.119.t:0 "Glorious Return\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.119.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition returns, treasure and knowledge in hand. They are heralded as heroes and share the tales of their experiences with the eager ears of our populace."
 diggy_dungeons.119.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 diggy_dungeons.120.t:0 "Beyond the Premises\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.120.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the main rooms of the library cleared out and in various states of repair, one of the construction crews reports of a break-in that revealed a zig-zagging chasm into the dark depths of the mountain. After some first inspections we were attacked by a small fighting force of goblins, armed with weapons of higher quality than initially expected. Quickly the defences were rallied so that construction would not be hindered.\n\nAfter some fighting the goblins were either killed or fled back into the dark, but the chasm clearly posed a serious security hazard. After much discussion the decision to send another expedition into the library was deemed reasonable, and a new force of explorers were sent out to brave its halls.\n\nArriving at the point of the break-in, the expedition leader reviews and takes stock of her men and  supplies. But even as this proceeded, screams could be heard from the dark below. Faint lights appeared in the depths, quickly drawing nearer. The soldiers readied their weapons against the approaching foe, readying a defense against a tunnel in the wall."
 diggy_dungeons.120.a:0 "We will stand united"

 diggy_dungeons.121.t:0 "The Sword is Stronger Than the Claw\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.121.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins arrived in manageable waves, trickling into the room in small groups. They were mostly disoriented and confused as to what exactly was happening. This meant that our soldiers had no trouble keeping the enemy at bay, although the waves got stronger towards the end. Then, as suddenly as they appeared, the goblins stopped coming through, leaving the path ahead clear."
 diggy_dungeons.121.a:0 "A great start to our endeavour"

 diggy_dungeons.122.t:0 "Broken Wall, Broken Shields\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.122.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The goblins crashed through the hole in the wall in an unending tidal wave, goblin after goblin disgorging from the stone wound. Our soldiers were slowly and steadily driven back, each line of defence falling almost as soon as they were erected. Then, after a bloody back and forth, the goblins retreated back into the dark. The path is clear, but the price was high."
 diggy_dungeons.122.a:0 "Not the best start, but a start nonetheless"

 diggy_dungeons.123.t:0 "Gazing Into the Abyss\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.123.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The chasm stretches deep below, its yawning dark beckons those at the precipice. Some soldiers are uneasy already, mentioning some strange force numbing their senses.\n\nBut the expedition leader must determine how to best approach the chasm.\n\nQuickly two options stand out. The chasm has repeating platforms and terraces protruding from the walls, which could be secured and made walkable, adding safe waiting spots, but at a high cost to our supplies. The other possibility is to use winches from the library construction to rope the soldiers down one by one."
 diggy_dungeons.123.a:0 "Secure the platforms"
 diggy_dungeons.123.b:0 "Just rope down"

 diggy_dungeons.124.t:0 "The Way Down\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.124.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At first the plan with the ropes worked out. One by one the soldiers touched down on the floor of the chasm, but towards the end the winches began creaking under the constant strain, and the rope itself started degrading. Then, piece by piece, the mechanism broke, sending many men falling to their deaths, destroying supplies and other important equipment."
 diggy_dungeons.124.a:0 "It all comes crashing down"

 diggy_dungeons.125.t:0 "The Abyss Gazes Back\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.125.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The terraces proved to be too unstable to safely traverse. Rocks breaking loose left and right sent equipment flying into the unknown dark, with only the sound of shattering tools reaching us. Our pitons and ropes managed to catch our men, thankfully,  so that we did not lose any of our crew. Despite the havoc, we did  all reach steady ground again, able to go on."
 diggy_dungeons.125.a:0 "Salvage what we can and continue"

 diggy_dungeons.126.t:0 "Descension\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.126.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With pitons and rope, strong pickaxes and sturdy spikes we managed to get down through the chasm with no problem whatsoever. In fact our morale improved after that first encounter with the goblins. Songs were sung, it all felt more like a stroll through the mountain instead of a dangerous descent."
 diggy_dungeons.126.a:0 "The climbing gear was worth the money"

 diggy_dungeons.127.t:0 "The Horde\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.127.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Walking along the bottom of the chasm instilled a strange mood in the explorers. Often the scouts would see something in the pitch-black dark, only for it to be a false alarm. The sound of scurrying claws dragged across stone echoed through the walls. There was something in the dark, just no one knew where it was exactly.\n\nIt all happened so quickly. From one second to the other the goblins descended upon us. Flashing teeth and claws, discarded swords and broken shields in their hands, they attacked us before the scouts could sound the alarm."
 diggy_dungeons.127.a:0 "Fight for your lives!"

 diggy_dungeons.128.t:0 "Brought Low In the Dark\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.128.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their sudden appearance our soldiers quickly rallied around our banners. Fighting from those steady formations managed to repel most of the greenskins. Some managed to get through the defences nonetheless, but reinforcements from other parts of the battle could bolster the ranks again.\n\nAs the goblins lost their superiority in numbers they started retreating up the walls from whence they came. A quick survey of the damages showed that there had been some casualties, as expected, but overall the battle was a resounding victory."
 diggy_dungeons.128.a:0 "The path is clear"

 diggy_dungeons.129.t:0 "Decimation\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.129.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Just as quickly as it began it ended. After decimating our troops the goblins retreated into the dark again, seemingly content with what damage they had caused. Our medics now tend now to the wounded that can still be helped, and the surgeons patch up whatever they can. Many have fallen, far too many, but going back now is no option."
 diggy_dungeons.129.a:0 "We must go on"

 diggy_dungeons.130.t:0 "A Warband In the Deep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.130.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The past days had been quiet and fruitful. The cartographers managed to map out most of the lower levels, and our prospectors had even found some promising veins of ore, although nothing major.\n\nBut this soon changed with the echo of orcish war cries. The explorers knew immediately what would happen: A warband was roaming the chasm, and scouts soon reported that they were swiftly closing in . Our forces quickly took defensive positions, and just in time, as with unparalleled ferocity the orcs soon descended upon us."
 diggy_dungeons.130.a:0 "We will prevail"

 diggy_dungeons.131.t:0 "An Eventual Triumph\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.131.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite their ferocious nature, the orcs turned out to be not quite as dangerous as we had believed. The winding paths in this chasm meant that they could not attack in a full frontal assault and had to trickle into the battlefield. In the end the drawn-out battle ended in our favour, with the warband dispatched and destroyed."
 diggy_dungeons.131.a:0 "Very good"

 diggy_dungeons.132.t:0 "Overrun\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.132.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Charging into our defences from the front and from the sides, through hidden tunnels in the walls, the orcs rushed over us like a wave, cutting down everyone and everything in their path. Terrified screams of pain could be heard echoing from the walls, the gurgling of blood, and war cries of orcs.\n\nDespite our losses, we gave as good as we got, and eventually destroyed the warband -- but at a staggering price."
 diggy_dungeons.132.a:0 "A costly victory, but a victory nonetheless"

 diggy_dungeons.133.t:0 "The Underboss\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.133.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Our expedition has arrived at the end of the chasm. Over the past days goblin presence has become stronger and stronger, with many skirmishes here and there.\n\nBut now they stand in front of a rackety wooden castle clearly brimming with goblins. Floor by floor they cut themselves through until they arrive at the central chambers. There a large goblin sits on a throne of bones, wearing a shoddy crown. The soldiers have not yet been noticed, and so there is the opportunity to defeat this monster with brains, not just with brawn."
 diggy_dungeons.133.a:0 "Make a trap"

 diggy_dungeons.134.t:0 "Incarceration\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.134.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The trap is set and the expedition waits in the shadows. Eventually, the Boss leans back in his throne when the rackety cage falls down on him. This was the sign for the soldiers to come in and attack their helpless foe. Soon, all that is left of the Boss is a corpse."
 diggy_dungeons.134.a:0 "May you rot down here"

 diggy_dungeons.135.t:0 "Unhidden\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.135.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]During the construction of the trap our troops were suddenly overwhelmed by a patrol of goblins who immediately sounded the alarm. Within seconds the Boss was alerted and threateningly flourished his club at us.\n\nHis face was filled with a strange mixture of hate and glee, his teeth yellow-red against his dark green skin. We must be defensive if we wish to survive this encounter."
 diggy_dungeons.135.a:0 "The best defence is a good offence! Charge!"

 diggy_dungeons.136.t:0 "Blood and Bile\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.136.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the end all it took was a single sword plunged deep into the Boss' throat. Like a fountain of fresh springwater, blood and bile spilled out of his body, his bloated skin sagging down into a puddle of fat."

 diggy_dungeons.137.t:0 "Terror in the Deep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.137.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Goblins pour out from the walls. The Boss' club quakes the earth. One by one our men are slain. In the end only I remain. I can still hear them searching for me. They get closer. I can see the fire of their torches. Here. They. Come."
 diggy_dungeons.137.a:0 "A terrible end"

 diggy_dungeons.138.t:0 "The Home Stretch\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.138.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the threat of the Boss dealt with we can declare the chasm to be safe again. As we return to the library, however, new ideas for security measures are being drafted. Most importantly: seal off the chasm. Soon construction workers put their strengths to use and start patching up the wall, hopefully without another problem…"

 diggy_dungeons.140.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Just as construction began on the wall, one last swarm of goblins came out from the chasm below. Their shrieking was made up from threats of vengeance and promises of death. They fought recklessly, until the very last one dropped dead.

 diggy_dungeons.142.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]For the past months, construction work had been going swimmingly and many parts of the library could be used by our scholars already. The workers laboured on their periphery, fixing things up here and there. Recently, however, some scribes have reported strange noises near one of the lower floors. The initial investigation had gone nowhere with the inspector saying nothing was there.\n\nComplaints did not end, however. Over the next weeks, more and more people complained about noises and even missing books. At this point, the chief librarian had heard enough. Clearly, something was amiss, and he called for a new expedition into the library.\n\nWith the force assembled the expedition leader took stock of the situation. Together with a few scouts he surveyed the perimeter and a particularly perceptive peer provoked peculiar proceedings: Behind one of the shelves could be heard the rattles of a door swinging in a draft. He pushed the shelf aside, revealing an entrance into a deeper part of the library. From the dark corridor, the sound of wood bumping against wood echoes out."

Not only that but this path must have been dug by a xorn or a similarly creature with corvidian instincts: gems and gold were laid in hoard just a few minutes walk into the tunnel."

A senseless massacre that, in the end, benefitted absolutely no one. As the explorers settle down for the night there is a long silence in the camp. Those who fought were shunned by those who had resisted the urge, creating a dark emotional barrier within the camp.

Some would start drawing maps of strange places, reciting poetry or arcane formulas. Then, there would be quiet for some time, then there would be outbursts again.\n\nAfter the third time a soldier quoted from “Lugnut's Treatise on the Strange Rumorations of What Lies Beyond the House of the Riddling Sun of Rubaa and How Kitling Would Not Recognize Her Mother” the expedition leader had enough. He called a large meeting to discuss what was going on.\n\nAfter some lively discussion (and one of the lieutenants telling the story of some elf in Cannor nobody had ever heard of) there was a consensus. They were haunted not by a ghost, but by a much stranger enemy: A knowledge elemental. Memory made real. But how would one even fight such an apparition?"

But as they leave the hall, their inebriation disappears instantly, the wine turns to water, and the fruits and meats become nothing but mushrooms."

diggy_dungeons.262.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It has become increasingly apparent that someone in the expedition is not who they claim to be, or at least, not anymore. Several expedition members have been found mauled, in places where no one outside of anyone from the expedition itself should have been able to reach. Paranoia runs rampant, and nobody trusts anyone anymore. It would be wise to start eliminating suspects based on who could have been where for what murders, to eventually find the culprit. Alternatively, we could just stab anyone who says or does anything even remotely suspicious."

diggy_dungeons.265.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After many expeditionaries were lost, be it found dead after being murdered or killed for supposedly behaving suspiciously, the imposter is finally identified. After surviving a stab through the heart that would have killed any other, the supposed expeditionary shed off its false form, and transformed into a monstrously large hag. Wounded, but far from killed, the monster fled into the caves, leaving a trail of blood in its wake."

And sure enough, after no murders took place for quite a while, one of the expeditionaries shifted into the form of a monstrous hag before a dozen witnesses, attempting to make another kill. Through quick reactions, the would-be victim was saved, and the hag was driven off. Wounded, but far from killed, the monster fled into the caves, leaving a trail of blood in its wake."

diggy_dungeons.268.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After following the trail of blood through the winding caves, the expeditionaries finally find what must undoubtedly be the way to the hag’s lair. A stinking maze, littered with bones and rotting meat, still lies between them and the monster, and the hoard of wealth it must have amassed in all the time it has preyed upon these caves. With the size of this maze, it might be better to split up to more quickly explore it, and mark dead ends. While this would give the hag less time, though, it would make the smaller parties much more vulnerable in the meantime."

As they keep pushing through the stinking passageways for hour after hour, though, they soon find themselves exhausted, and forced to rest. This is when the hag struck. Killing one of the expeditionaries that was standing guard in a single blow, the ennis hag rampages through the expedition, killing anyone in its way. Before the expeditionaries have a chance to react properly, the monster has already retreated into the depths of the maze again."
diggy_dungeons.269.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expeditionaries comb through the maze, mapping it as they go, they soon find that some of the small parties have been killed as they were isolated from the larger group.

diggy_dungeons.272.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Finally, the expedition stands before the hag’s lair. It is not cut out of the cave, as the maze before was, but rather wrought from bits of wood, bone, cloth, and other materials that were presumably scavenged from the depths of the caves. The large ramshackle structure looks sturdy enough, but also… highly flammable. Still, burning the place down might also deprive us of the treasures the creature has amassed over its reign of terror in these caves."

Unable to break through the wall of blades and magic it is faced with, the hag finally exhausts itself after blow after blow does not land. Finally, the creature succumbs to the many wounds it has sustained, and slumps dead to the floor. With great relief, the expeditionaries search the monster’s abode, and find a great many treasures hidden away in the darkest corners."

 diggy_dungeons.400.t:0 "Dimlherd, the Geothermal Facility"
 diggy_dungeons.400.d:0 "An ancient geothermal power facility dating back to the days of Aul-Dwarov, the famed Dimlherd of the Dwarovar has been rumored to lay beneath our very feet. Lacking concrete maps or logistics, sending a party of adventurers to explore the region would be a fool's errand. Yet it seems that we are indeed fools. The caverns below are an area of particularly dense volacanic activity, known for active lava flows, fiery geysers, and all manner of ghastly horrors native to the Serpenspine. Yet we must persist, for the glory awaiting us at the end of this trek shall be worth the many lives it will take to grasp it."
 diggy_dungeons.400.a:0 "Let's start exploring!"

 diggy_dungeons.401.t:0 "The Expedition Begins\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.401.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As we descend into the dark depths, the path to the fabled facility forks, revealing two ways forward. A stream of molten lava scattered with remnants of piping dictates that the most direct path is along its banks. Yet the older and wiser among the adventuring band caution the captain to choose the safer and longer path alongside the ravine's ridge, where a narrow pass can be seen."
 diggy_dungeons.401.a:0 "Follow the lava stream."
 diggy_dungeons.401.b:0 "Take the safer path."

 diggy_dungeons.402.t:0 "Lava Tides\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.402.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]At first, it was a mere rumbling sound in the distance. But as it drew nearer, it became clear that the stream we had been following along would soon rise, with splotches of molten rock already covering the path to our backs. Soon enough, the rocky pathway will flood in its entirety, and if nothing is done, we will soon rest beneath the glowing waves."
 diggy_dungeons.402.a:0 "Seek higher ground!"

 diggy_dungeons.403.t:0 "The Ridge Pass\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.403.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The closer we got to the secondary path, the clearer it became that we were mistaken. There would be no safety nor quarter. The ridge offered very little in the way of freedom of movement, precariously suspended over the ravine, with the stream of lava within clear view, a constant reminder of what would come to those unable to find their footing."
 diggy_dungeons.403.a:0 "This is insane. Let's just follow the river."
 diggy_dungeons.403.b:0 "Following along the path *carefully*."

 diggy_dungeons.404.t:0 "The Floor is Lava\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.404.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the rocky cliffs began to crumble away and many men tumbled into the lava below, those that remained could only spare a fraction of a second to process the devastating loss of their comrades. There would be no solace in grief, for as quickly as the tides enveloped the thin pass, it receded, leaving not even bones behind."
 diggy_dungeons.404.a:0 "Nature is a fickle thing."

 diggy_dungeons.405.t:0 "Burned Toes\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.405.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the great rumbling subsided and the panic died down, it quickly became clear that we had gotten lucky. A false alarm. Or rather, a tide far less severe than originally anticipated. For if the scouts had been correct, there would be no men to continue the expedition."
 diggy_dungeons.405.a:0 "Rejoice, for we have been spared."

 diggy_dungeons.406.t:0 "An Unwilling Swim\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.406.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]No amount of caution could spare the party from the horrid fate that would soon follow. Walls crumbling as the ridge cleaved itself in two amidst tremors, depositing many of our comrades and pack animals into the lavaflow below."

 diggy_dungeons.408.t:0 "The Slumbering Naga\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.408.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Of the many sights to be seen beneath the surface, few are as rare as the naga. A serpent with the face of a woman, these crafty spellcasters can make quick work of an adventuring party, using strategy and cunning to outmaneuver greater enemies. Slumped over a dilapidated turbine is one of these rarities, adorned with charcoal-black scales and lighting snoring with a satisfied grin. Fortune appears to remain with us."
 diggy_dungeons.408.a:0 "Attack the creature in its sleep."

 diggy_dungeons.409.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Standing before the expedition is an ancient dwarven outpost, clearly a remnant from before the Final Days. Boasting a sturdy door and several deactivated turrets, the contents of the building would probably still be untouched."
 diggy_dungeons.409.a:0 "Break the door down!"

 diggy_dungeons.410.t:0 "Stirred from Sleep\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.410.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the naga slowly rises from its slumber, a bit of sage wisdom runs through the captain's mind. Dark nagas, identifiable by their ebony scales, are known mind-readers. Whilst the expedition's footsteps were quiet, the racing minds of so many adventurers was enough to alert the enemy."
 diggy_dungeons.410.a:0 "Wait, why hasn't it attacked yet?"

 diggy_dungeons.411.t:0 "Flayed Serpent\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.411.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The slaughter was swift and merciless, the corpse dumped into the lava stream after stripping it of valuables. Not a single adventurer lost their life in this battle."

 diggy_dungeons.412.t:0 "Acidic Blood\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.412.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The slaughter was swift, and the spoils wonderful. The serpent was flayed with due haste, with its meat mixed into our food stores. All seemed right in the world, until our men began dropping like flied. One, two, then a dozen more. Panic ensued, until the cause became known to all. Nagas possess acidic blood, deadly to ingest. Worse than that, it appears as though a large portion of the food stock has been contaminated."
 diggy_dungeons.412.a:0 "Why must we always learn lessons the hard way?"

 diggy_dungeons.413.t:0 "Mission Improbable\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.413.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The naga's light slumber was clearly far deeper than it seemed. As the anxiety-riddled adventurers attempted to sneak past, a great clanging sound ensued as a clumsy paladin's shield clattered to the ground, the bone-chilling sound echoing throughout the ravine. Yet the naga did not stir."
 diggy_dungeons.413.a:0 "We need to have a conversation about proper fastenings."

 diggy_dungeons.414.t:0 "Explosives, my Beloved\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.414.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The door was blasted off its hinges, and the mostly pristine contents of the tower were swiftly looted."
 diggy_dungeons.414.a:0 "Blackpowder is truly a marvel."

 diggy_dungeons.415.t:0 "Oops.\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.415.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the explosives are laid out before the door and detonated, the tower stood tall. Yet something else began to stir from the cavern."
 diggy_dungeons.415.a:0 "Did I do that?"

 diggy_dungeons.416.t:0 "The Naga's Offer\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.416.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the beast licks her lips, the captain can hear her voice permeating through his skull, rattling between the ears like a windchime in a hurricane.\n\n"It is rare to receive guests. The warmth drives away. I have little to offer. Unlike you."\n\nA sickening deal. She offers her services as a guide, offering knowledge of a secret passage that will allow us to safely bypass a great danger. In return, she requests one thing: fresh meat."
 diggy_dungeons.416.a:0 "We are not mere cattle!"
 diggy_dungeons.416.b:0 "This will save lives. It is the only way."

 diggy_dungeons.417.t:0 "Flameskulls from Above!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.417.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Flameskulls are rumored to be the souls of the deceased, incarnate in the form of floating, flaming skulls of moderate killing ability. Their bone-chilling laughter echoes throughout the cavern as a battle formation is assumed, the enemy circling overhead."
 diggy_dungeons.417.a:0 "Clerics forward!"
 diggy_dungeons.417.b:0 "Battle formation!"
 diggy_dungeons.417.c:0 "Warriors, to the front!"

 diggy_dungeons.418.t:0 "Mutiny!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.418.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite that charisma of the party leader, the many individuals slated for execution by naga rose up in defiance and defense of their lives."
 diggy_dungeons.418.a:0 "I'm sure we can talk this out."

 diggy_dungeons.419.t:0 "A Deal Sealed in Blood\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.419.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It was over in an instant, countless souls engulfed by the naga's jaws. No witnesses. They were to have died in a cave-in, a tragic but ultimately unavoidable accident."
 diggy_dungeons.419.a:0 "A necessary sacrifice."

 diggy_dungeons.420.t:0 "Banished with Steel\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.420.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A quick response combined with deadly coordination made quick work of the floating fiends, reducing them to piles of bones. Despite our best efforts, the powdered skulls continue to smolder with a dull flame."
 diggy_dungeons.420.a:0 "We shouldn't linger."

 diggy_dungeons.421.t:0 "A Bone-Gnashing Defeat\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.421.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the skulls pass overhead, they leave deep burns in those they touch and cause chaos throughout our lines. The fight was brutal, but we eventually emerged victorious, though the cost was great."
 diggy_dungeons.421.a:0 "Let's not do that again."

 diggy_dungeons.422.t:0 "Banished with Holy Water\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.422.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the clerics chant their miracles, the flameskulls vanish into puddles of residue, coated in holy water to prevent ressurection."
 diggy_dungeons.422.a:0 "Never leave home without a cleric!"

 diggy_dungeons.423.t:0 "No Laughing Matter\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.423.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The final sounds of demonic cackling are silenced, and the cavern grows silent once more. A quick prayer for the fallen is held, then the expedition moves on."
 diggy_dungeons.423.a:0 "Let us ensure their sacrifice was not in vain."

 diggy_dungeons.424.t:0 "The Perimeter\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.424.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A welcome change from the monotonous igneous rock that dominated the landscape, a dwarven perimeter wall has come into vision. We have reached our first destination."
 diggy_dungeons.424.a:0 "Huzzah!"

 diggy_dungeons.425.t:0 "The Colossal Lavafall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.425.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]An astronomical waterfall of pure lava, crashing into a molten lake over 200 meters below. Such a sight would typically invoke a sense of awe, which was certainly present within our ranks. But this awe quickly turned to dread as the expedition realized that the desitnation lay at the bottom of this drop, with no side-paths to take."
 diggy_dungeons.425.a:0 "Break out the rock-climbing gear."
 diggy_dungeons.425.b:0 "Time for some extreme canoeing!"

 diggy_dungeons.426.t:0 "Stumbled, but not Fallen\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.426.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Rock climbing under such volatile conditions is a tall order, yet the party managed with little trouble. A few unfortunate souls stumbled and perished in the fire below, but the bulk of us remain unscathed, less a few burns."
 diggy_dungeons.426.a:0 "All things considered, that went well."

 diggy_dungeons.427.t:0 "The Story of a Lifetime\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.427.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]It is a rare thing to see genuine smiles and laughter following unfathomable danger, yet as the expedition reached the shore of the lava lake, cheers and celebration erupted. This meriment was not born out of hysteria or relief, but rather excitement. Hands shake, chests bump, and soiled greaves are cleaned and polished."
 diggy_dungeons.427.a:0 "No one will believe us."

 diggy_dungeons.428.t:0 "Quite the Fall\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.428.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The great weight of our luggage combined with shoddy rock climbing has resulted in quite the wall collapse. As bodies tumble into the lava below, we must simply persevere."
 diggy_dungeons.428.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The field of lava canoeing is a largely unstudied one, unsurprisingly. And equally unsurprising was the result. Making makeshift canoes out of tarps that are definitely not lavaproof, filled to the brim with heavy and flammable cargo, then packing dozens of adventurers on each one, then hurtling this makeshit canoe off of a 200-meter tall cliff whilst lava rains from the sky. It's a miracle any of us survived."
 diggy_dungeons.428.a:0 "How could we have predicted this?"

 diggy_dungeons.429.t:0 "The Great Perimeter\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.429.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Surrounding the Geothermal Facility is a wall fortified with materials yet unknown to us. The vast surface of stone is occasionally interrupted by miniscule cracks seeping through, giving hope that the wall may yet be penetrable. Despite this, it may be best to look for a proper entrance before resorting to the direct approach."
 diggy_dungeons.429.a:0 "Today, we choose violence."
 diggy_dungeons.429.b:0 "Be safe, circle around!"

 diggy_dungeons.430.t:0 "Sturdy Beyond Measure\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.430.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite our best efforts, the wall yet stands, undeterred as if to scoff at the notion of our middling explosives leaving a scratch on it. Though this would typically be a demoralizing sight, fascination quickly sparked from the failure. Such a stone is undocumented by even our most thorough geographer's manuals."
 diggy_dungeons.430.a:0 "A marvelous discovery!"

 diggy_dungeons.431.t:0 "Explosives in a Live Volcano\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.431.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The satisfyingly ear-shattering sounds of explosives ring out throughout the cavern. Not a scratch on the wall. Moments later, eyes widen as the wall begins to rattle. Fleeting hope swiftly becomes despair as a realization is had; the entire cavern is shaking with the ferocity of an active volcano."
 diggy_dungeons.431.a:0 "Duck for cover boys!"

 diggy_dungeons.432.t:0 "The Burning Fever\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.432.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A fever is typically a sign of infection, yet this was clearly not the case within the magmatic depths. The ambient temperature of the caverns was simply high enough to induce fatigue, thirst, and even death. A particularly close pass with a stream of lava launches a new wave of heat at the party."
 diggy_dungeons.432.a:0 "Quickly, the water!"
 diggy_dungeons.432.b:0 "A little sweat never hurt anyone."

 diggy_dungeons.433.t:0 "The Eruption\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.433.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]"This is the last time we use explosives in an active volcano!"\n\nScreams echo throughout the cavern as men frantically seek shelter, begin setting for higher ground, and praying. Yet the calmer among the group manages to ralley the party, organizing them into a search party for an old dwarven failsafe."
 diggy_dungeons.433.a:0 "The dwarves of old were thorough; and so too must we be."

 diggy_dungeons.434.t:0 "Tempered Soul\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.434.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Despite the horrendous conditions, we stood strong amidst the wails of anguish. We are tenacity incarnate, and we will survive this danger, as we have time and time again."
 diggy_dungeons.434.a:0 "No adventurers will die this day!"

 diggy_dungeons.435.t:0 "The Silent Death\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.435.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Monsters we can deal with. Avalanches, disease, and the cold are preventable. Yet this heat felled more adventurers this day than all three of these things combined. We must pray for the fallen..."
 diggy_dungeons.435.a:0 "...and then continue moving."

 diggy_dungeons.436.t:0 "The Valve that Could.\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.436.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A single valve was all that stood between our lives and the encroaching magma. Yet a simple turn, combined with some old-fashioned elbow grease, was all it took to release the pressure from the volcano and prevent a full eruption."
 diggy_dungeons.436.a:0 "The marvels of engineering."

 diggy_dungeons.437.t:0 "Minor Eruption\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.437.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A minor eruption blasts throughout the caverns, wiping out the entirety of the advance party, and wounding a large portion of the main body. Hardly a party member was left without severe burns, even dozens of meters from the magma flow."
 diggy_dungeons.437.a:0 "Tend to your wounds swiftly, lest the lava comes back for another go."

 diggy_dungeons.438.t:0 "A Motly Camp of Kobolds\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.438.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]An unexpected sight indeed, it appears as though a group of kobolds have made their home alongside the perimeter of the facility, apparently relying on its defense mechanisms to protect themselves. Although everything down here seems to want us dead, these small creatures appear more frightened than anything, scurrying away at the slightest noise and refusing to fight us."
 diggy_dungeons.438.a:0 "Perhaps they can be reasoned with."
 diggy_dungeons.438.b:0 "Get em boys!"

 diggy_dungeons.439.t:0 "Delightful Conversation\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.439.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]A few words are exchanged between the party linguist and what appears to be the chief of the kobolds. Two truths were revealed. Firstly, these kobolds are legendary masters of Dragonchess, competing with nearby tribes and developing numerous strategies our men had never even dreamed of. Secondly, and probably more importantly, they are not afraid of us, but of what lies aheads."
 diggy_dungeons.439.a:0 "Thanks for the warning, friends."

 diggy_dungeons.440.t:0 "Lost in Translation\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.440.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Dozens of tiny feet skitter away as the party linguist trips on his words. It appears as though the linguist had collectively insulted the entire tribe."
 diggy_dungeons.440.a:0 "At least they don't seem angry."

 diggy_dungeons.441.t:0 "Heroic Victory\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.441.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]After a brilliant and hard-fought battle, the 3-foot tall kobolds scittered away, without dealing even a single casualty! As the men helped themselves to what wa sleft of the camp, we can't help but wonder why they didn't put up more of a fight."
 diggy_dungeons.441.a:0 "Eh, whatever."

 diggy_dungeons.442.t:0 "Pitfalls Abound\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.442.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the men charged foward, the ground gave way, and the entire advance party tumbled harmlessly into a shallow pit. Though nonlethal, the entire ordeal was very embarassing, and allowed the kobolds ample time to loot our belongings and be on their way."
 diggy_dungeons.442.a:0 "They took my pocketwatch!"

 diggy_dungeons.443.t:0 "Kobolds' Warning\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.443.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We have reached the fork in the road where the kobolds told us the beast would lurk. Taking a right, which is the desired destination, will bring us directly into its nest. Thankfully, we have learned of a roundabout path that should allow us to avoid the creature entirely."
 diggy_dungeons.443.a:0 "For glory!"
 diggy_dungeons.443.b:0 "Heed the kooblds' advice."

 diggy_dungeons.444.t:0 "Behir Sighted!\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.444.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Among the creatures that one does not wish to see in the depths of the Dwarovar, the Behir is among the least desirable. A colossal beast, serpentine in nature but with twelve legs, blocks our way, with blue ligtning crackling at its mouth, blue eyes glistening with a sadistic delight. We have been caught wandering in its nest, and the only way out is to fight."
 diggy_dungeons.444.a:0 "For Carl!"

 diggy_dungeons.445.t:0 "The Facility Entrance\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.445.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]We've finally arrived. The proper entrance of Dimlherd, the famed Geothermal Facility that powered a large portion of the ancient Dwarven Empire. Though we've reached our destination, all is not well. The clambering racketry of mechanical sentries emanates from the doorway. It is clear that, in order to pass through the door, we must handle the turrets first."
 diggy_dungeons.445.a:0 "To battle!"
 diggy_dungeons.445.b:0 "Let's try throwing some bombs."

 diggy_dungeons.446.t:0 "By Magic and Steel\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.446.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]This was a foe unlike any we have faced thusfar. The beast clambered up and down the walls, gracefully weaving between projectiles and rock formations like a dancer across a stage. Even when arrows or spells met their mark, they bounced harmlessly off of the Behir's thick blue hide, less bothersome than a bee's sting. Yet our men were relentless. Dodging lightning breath and creating wards, they steadily and systematically took control of the situation, beating the Behir back with each successful blow. After many minutes of tense back-and-forth, silence envelops the field."
 diggy_dungeons.446.a:0 "The Behir is felled!"

 diggy_dungeons.447.t:0 "A Giggling Reaper\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.447.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]There was no escape from its breath. Men vaporized into ashes left and right, friends gone in an instant. They say only the truly insane volunteer for expeditions into the Dwarovar. Yet not even madmen would wish for a death such as this. Truly, we have encountered the reaper."
 diggy_dungeons.447.a:0 "Those sorry fools."

 diggy_dungeons.448.t:0 "Explosives in a Live Volcano\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.448.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]To the bafflement of the entire party, the minor detonation of some blackpowder had severe, unforseeable consequences. A foreboding rumble began to perforate throughout the cavern, a clear prelude to the magma that would soon be upon us."
 diggy_dungeons.448.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]"This is the last time we use explosives in an active volcano!"\n\nTo the bafflement of the entire party, the minor detonation of some blackpowder had severe, unforseeable consequences.

 diggy_dungeons.448.a:0 "It's gonna blow!"

 diggy_dungeons.449.t:0 "No Consequences Necessary\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.449.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Pure ingenuity. The decision to lob explosives in an active volcano was certainly a controversial one in the party, but it was nonetheless a fruitful one. The sentries were left as nothing but rubble, also blowing open a secret compartment full of mechanical bits!"
 diggy_dungeons.449.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]"Second time's the charm!"\n\nFollowing our first catastrophe involving explosives in a live volcano, we were much more prepared for the consequences of such an act. Proper fortifications to the structure of the cavern were employed, and a few grenades later, our handiwork has come to fruition."

 diggy_dungeons.500.d:0 "For what seems like days the expedition has been travelling down, into the bowels of the earth. Down and down following what was once a spiralling stone staircase, now a smooth slope of stone worn by the passage of time and countless feet. The only sounds are the echoing of footsteps and clattering of supplies as each man concentrates on keeping his balance. So preoccupied are the men that they hardly notice it until they're mere feet away - a great gleaming set of steel doors set into the stone wall. The doors are pristine, intricately engraved and polished, so bright in the torchlight that after days of exploration in low light they are difficult to look at directly. Surrounding the doors are an intricate set of gears and levers, beautifully crafted and apparently free of debris.\n\nA cleric squints at the runes repeated across the doors, mouthing them aloud as he translates. "Grumhardhûm, it reads Grumhardhûm'' he calls out. At this, a ripple passes through the gathered expeditionaries. Many have heard stories of the legendary forge of Grumhardhûm, said to have armoured every hero and high king of Aul-Dwarov. It was often rumoured that craftsmen in Grumhardhûm lived for two lifetimes, as a lifetime of expertise was necessary to even be granted the privilege of working there. Few believed the legends referred to a real place, and of those none thought it may still be intact in any form millennia after the fall of Aul-Dwarov. Rumours and stories spread through the gathered men like wildfire, eventually forcing the leader of the expedition to intervene to restore order. Many wish to attempt to enter the forge now, or at least crack open the doors to glimpse the wonders inside. However, the men are tired and lacking supplies - as much as it pains the leader too, he knows they must return home for now. If the wonders of Grumhardhûm have survived until now, they can wait for one more expedition."

 diggy_dungeons.501.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Upon reaching the end of the maze of tunnels and the winding staircase marked on the map, the scouts suddenly stop. As the rest of the expedition pushes past them, it becomes clear why. Before them stands the great steel gate of Grumhardhûm, still resplendent and majestic as it was when it was abandoned, just as the previous expedition had reported. Filled with hope that the great forge had been spared the destruction that befell all else in the Serpentspine, several forward scouts attempt to push the great doors apart to gain entry. Soon there is a line of men pushing upon the doors in unison, but to no avail - the gate remains still and silent."

As the gate closes behind the last man, everyone relaxes. The finely crafted doors are still unblemished and will provide a bulwark against any creatures attempting to sneak in from the rear. Beyond the threshold, the walls of the entrance corridor are covered in pipes and more carvings, but unlike the door these are blackened by soot and grime. The floor is likewise filthy, littered with metal and bone scraps, the unmistakable signs of a goblin infestation. Grimly but resolutely, the expedition moves towards the flickering orange light that illuminates the end of the corridor."

 diggy_dungeons.503.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Frustrated by an hour of no progress, a mage pushes through the throng of men around the gates and attempts to blast them open. As their spell connects a horrific grinding and shearing of metal upon metal echoes around the caverns, and the expedition instinctively covers their ears and cowers. By the time they look up the once great gates have fallen, now a bent and twisted heap of metal. As the expedition steps over the remains and moves into the forge, the mood is sombre. Each expeditionary mourns the loss of the great gates, not just for their artisanry but also for the defence from rear ambushes they would have provided. Their hopes are further crushed as they see the floor littered with metal and bone scraps and the carvings on the wall defaced by soot, the signs of a goblin infestation. Not wanting to dwell on the gates any longer, the expedition makes haste towards the flickering orange light illuminating the end of the corridor."
 diggy_dungeons.503.a:0 "I think I feel a draft from behind…"

 diggy_dungeons.504.t:0 "The Great Forge\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.504.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition approaches the end of the corridor, the temperature continues to rise. Soldiers sweat and shift in their heavy armour, looking enviously at the airy robes and simple leather armour afforded to others. Rounding a corner and entering the forge proper, a cavernous circular room bathed in the orange light opens up before them. Magma flows and drips from pipes running the length of the room, running to and from a great pit in the centre of the room. So wide is the pit that, combined with the heat haze present, nobody can see across it to the other side clearly. Some of the braver scouts venture to the edge, peering over it to see a great cauldron far below, suspended by huge chains with each link thicker than a man's torso. There are also simple metal elevators hanging haphazardly below, intended to bring workers to levels below this one, but they appear to be stuck and are out of reach for now. The floor is strewn with soot and debris - all kinds of metal, bone, cloth and food scraps lie everywhere. Looking up, a giant dome is far above, funnelling steam and other vapours into a huge hole at the apex. In the shadow cast by the dome, rusty metal scaffolding and rickety ladders lead to nooks populated with glowing unblinking eyes. Equidistant around the walls are carved stone doorways leading into miscellaneous rooms and antechambers, some with dedicated pipes serving them.\n\nAs the scouts return to report what they saw to the rest of the expedition, one steps upon a discarded sheet of pig iron. A screech of alarm rings out and a ruddy brown arm grabs their ankle - there was a feral goblin sleeping underneath it! Abandoning caution, the scouts sprint back to the main party as more goblins pour from the surrounding rooms and from around the pit. There is barely enough time for the expedition to close ranks around the scouts before the goblins crash into them."

 diggy_dungeons.505.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Using the narrow entrance corridor as a chokepoint, the feral goblins' charge was quickly broken upon the expedition's shields and spears with few casualties from the defenders. As the remaining goblins turn tail and flee it becomes apparent that the goblins' fallen brethren have brought quite a haul. Most of them were kitted in crudely modified armour and wielding weapons sourced from inside the forge - even after so many years of misuse, these pieces are still finely crafted and would fetch a high price from collectors."
 diggy_dungeons.505.a:0 "Ugh, this chestplate still has half a goblin in it."

 diggy_dungeons.506.t:0 "A Feral Goblin Tide\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.506.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The relentless flood of feral goblins overwhelmed the wall of shields and the expedition scattered, fleeing back down the corridor towards the entrance. By the time the expedition leader had rallied the troops for a counterattack to drive off the goblins, many of the more unfortunate men lay dead and trampled upon the floor in exchange for a pitifully small number of feral goblin lives. The dead are dragged solemnly into the entrance corridor to be retrieved later and the expedition continues as best it can."
 diggy_dungeons.506.a:0 "What a waste of lives…"

 diggy_dungeons.507.t:0 "Beasts Everywhere\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.507.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the immediate danger past, the expedition huddles together in an antechamber near the entrance to plan their next move. The untouched levels below are tantalisingly close, but they cannot continue until all the remaining squatters have been eradicated. The mages and scouts of the expedition present the leader with options for which to deal with first.\n\nHigh above, they have identified the eyes in the shadowed nooks and occasional echoing cries as those of giant cave bats. These bats are even larger than normal and what little of them can be seen has a distinctive reddish tint, leading several mages to suggest they may have been mutated by the residual magics of the forge. If the swarm is not dealt with swiftly, a careless action could bring them down upon the expedition.\n\nSomewhere on the same level as the expedition is the lair of the feral goblins that first assailed them. The remains of the feral goblin charge will have retreated there for safety, as the strongest goblins will be lounging about in the comfort of the lair. The lair will also contain the feral goblin clanboss' choice of loot scavenged from the forge. Cleansing the feral goblins will reward the expedition with these spoils, but it is impossible to know yet just how many lurk within the lair.\n\nLastly, a platform hangs between this level and the next surrounded on all sides by pipes. Judging by the various valves, dials and levers, the area was used to control the flow of liquids through the many pipes in the forge. Most of the controls are in disrepair and those that appear serviceable are covered by magma leaking from weakened pipe junctions. If the flow of magma to the upper levels can be disabled, it will prevent further dangerous leaks from the pipes above. Again, the mages caution that the unstable magics of the forge are likely to have spawned magma oozes wherever magma leaks, but these cannot be separated from regular magma without closer inspection."
 diggy_dungeons.507.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition regroups in the antechamber, leaning against walls and pillars for a well deserved rest. In the meantime, the expedition leader is again presented with the potential options to clear the remaining beasts."
 diggy_dungeons.507.a:0 "Bring down the giant bats!"
 diggy_dungeons.507.b:0 "Cleanse the feral goblin lair!"
 diggy_dungeons.507.c:0 "Splatter the magma oozes!"

 diggy_dungeons.508.t:0 "The Bats Above\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.508.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]In the antechamber a debate rages among the expedition about how best to handle the bats. "One fireball and the whole swarm will be set alight" argues a trigger-happy mage, "we won't even have to fight them!" This idea is quickly vetoed by the leader of the scouts "Are you crazy? You'll bring the whole scaffold down on us!" Before the mage can snap a response, he continues "besides, this whole place is hotter than a dragon's armpit. Those bats probably eat magma for breakfast… What if your fireballs make them stronger? Then we'll be fighting giant flaming bats!" After several more minutes, the expedition leader steps in to make the final decision - no fireballs. As some of the less disciplined mages sulk, he organises a group of armoured soldiers and light archers to face the bats, leaving the rest of the expedition to hunker down in the antechamber and wait.\n\nThe plan is simplicity itself. The soldiers will stand in a loose square around the archers, ready to protect them from any swooping bats. As of now the swarm has not been alerted so the first strike is the key to the whole operation. The archers have been instructed to aim for the glowing eyes in the darkness, calling out their target's position quietly to ensure no bat is targeted twice. Once all the archers have identified a target they will fire on the lead archer's mark, hopefully killing or disabling most of the swarm before they can even get close. Even without their great numbers the remaining bats may still be dangerous, as their leathery wings have been known to deflect arrows and chip swords. Still, so long as everyone remains calm the casualties should be kept to a minimum."
 diggy_dungeons.508.a:0 "Take aim…"

 diggy_dungeons.509.t:0 "The Goblins Lair\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.509.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Following the trails of blood left by the feral goblins, the expedition's scouts have located the lair. It sits in a room almost antipodal to the entrance, hidden by the heat haze over the central pit. The entrance has been repeatedly smashed and broken, enlarging it enough for more than 6 men to walk through shoulder to shoulder. The adjoining chambers have also had their doorways battered, inner walls collapsed and windows barricaded with sheet metal, creating a rather spacious lair protected from most of the heat of the forge. As the scouts watched, several dead feral goblins were brought from the lair and unceremoniously hurled into the central pit - no doubt their clanboss was angered by their failure to crush the expedition. Unfortunately, with the windows blocked the scouts were unable to ascertain how many goblins remain in the lair or where they store their loot.\n\nDespite the lack of information on their numbers, the expedition leader decides to carry out the strike immediately. Right now the goblins will be bickering and fighting over who should take the blame for their previous attack's failure, and who should risk their life to try again. If they can be caught off guard while trapped in their lair their looted equipment and possible numeric advantage will be completely nullified.\n\nHugging the walls of the forge chamber to remain undetected, the expedition approaches from both sides of the lair simultaneously. At the front are mages escorted by a small retinue of soldiers. On the leader's mark the mages will blast fireballs into the lair, summon flashes of light and plumes of smoke, and generally attempt to disorient all the goblins inside. Any goblins rushing out of the lair for reprieve will be swiftly cut down, and once the mages are spent the main body of the army will enter the lair to mop up the remains. As the leader begins counting down with hand signals a loud belch emanates from the lair doorway. Daring not to breathe, the whole expedition watches powerlessly as a cave troll lumbers out of the doorway. It turns to the side lazily, meeting the leader's gaze uncomprehendingly. As its eyes widen and it raises the misshapen hunk of metal it carries with both hands, the leader desperately cries "Now! Attack now!""
 diggy_dungeons.509.a:0 "Quickly, aim for the eyes!"

 diggy_dungeons.510.t:0 "The Magma Below\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.510.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Unsurprisingly, none of the expedition are keen on being sent down to the magma-covered platform hanging in the pit. After a quick drawing of lots, a small group of soldiers are chosen to accompany a water mage and an engineer down to the platform to attempt to disable the flow of magma. Sending too many men risks the weakened and overheated supports breaking, and so the remainder of the expedition can do nothing but watch as the group is lowered on chains to the platform. As the first soldier touches down on one of the few magma-free spaces, two magma oozes leap at them from the surrounding magma! Only a quick burst of water from the mage above him keeps them from engulfing him, and they are visibly shaken as the oozes recoil back into the safety of the magma.\n\nThe next few minutes are much the same - the group makes painfully slow progress across the platform, clearing pools of magma and dodging magma ooze ambushes as best they can. As they reach the dense tangle of pipes with controls, the engineer suddenly cries out "I can see the emergency shutoff pipes, but the valves are broken! I can't close them!". There is little time to make a decision - the water mage is visibly exhausted and out of mana potions, and several of the group have already perished to the oozes. If the valves can be repaired and the flow of magma arrested then the magma oozes on the platform will be severely weakened, perhaps enough to save the brave men down there. Though, their situation is already pretty dire… what's the worst that could happen if the group is simply allowed to perish?"

 diggy_dungeons.510.b:0 "Quickly, throw him whatever he needs to repair the valves!"

 diggy_dungeons.511.t:0 "Broken Elevators\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.511.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]With the surrounding beasts cleared and the expedition out of danger for now, interest in exploring the lower levels of the forge is reignited. The elevators once used to travel between floors hang below, their chains tangled and rusted. Many of the elevators are missing platforms and guardrails and some have come loose altogether, barely visible laying battered and broken deep in the pit. In this state the expedition leader would be hard pressed to find a single man willing to travel down using these, let alone a whole expedition.\n\nAfter several hours of examinations with telescopes and attempts to untangle the elevators with blasts of air, the engineers have come up with a plan. Though most of the elevators are not worth fixing, a group of larger freight elevators have been preserved in good condition and have swung free from the debris binding them thanks to the efforts of the mages. Unfortunately, the brakes are still deployed on each elevator and their chains have been greatly weakened by the friction as the elevators slipped further and further down over time. If these elevators are hauled up intact, the only major repair required is the replacement of the length of chain that hung above the elevators. However, the engineers caution that the new chain must be of sufficiently sturdy metal or the next elevator to fall may take half the expedition with it.\n\nAmid the rhythmic cries of "Heave, Ho!" as the men haul the elevators up, the expedition leader considers his options. The expedition has small stores of steel, iron and bronze reserved for mending armour and emergency structural repairs. In a pinch, these could be fashioned into remarkably sturdy chains. Alternatively, the metal scraps strewn across the forge could be used instead - after all, they were good enough for the old dwarves of Grumhardhûm."

As the cry of "Fire!" rings across their ranks, a cloud of arrows sails gracefully up, piercing countless bats. The remaining bats shriek and swoop, their fangs sharper and hide tougher than expected, but with their numbers so thin casualties from the expedition are left few and far between. While tending to the wounded, a cleric notes that many bats were killed with a single shot through their eye, leaving their unusual reddish hide intact.

Their bodies lie down there with the troll now, to be retrieved by a later expedition. Seeing their troll fall broke the will of the remaining feral goblins and they were easily mown down by the reinvigorated expedition soldiers. The panicked spells cast at the beginning of the operation destroyed much of the loot lying out in the open in the lair.

 diggy_dungeons.521.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition once again passes over the threshold of Grumhardhûm, the familiar heat of the forge hits them. This time, most of the expedition members have stowed the heavy armour they wore through the caves in favour of lighter leather and hide armour. Some mages have even procured magical armour engraved with temperature controlling runes, much to the jealousy of the other members. Many survivors of the last expedition have returned as expected, eager to see what hides in the lower levels that were made accessible by their previous efforts.\n\nSince the last expedition some small exploratory parties have braved the journey to the lower levels to scout ahead. All turned back quickly from the heat, unsettled by the unnatural emptiness of the cavernous forge. Their efforts were not in vain, however, as the last party noticed a peculiar stack of engraved metal plates on the lower levels near an elevator. Some of these plates were scattered around as well and they appear to have all originally been identical. The plates are all melted, dented, torn or scratched in different places - no fully intact plate exists. The engraving is clearly some form of runic script, but deciphering the whole message is difficult. Additionally, the back of some of the plates holds a different engraving.

For a moment, there is only stunned silence among the expedition. Then a soldier cuffs him over the head, "idiot, this is the Grumhardhûm, not the tunnels of Ovdal Lodhum!"

 diggy_dungeons.524.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Translating the words of their ancestors is a common practice for dwarves, even more so since they began reclaiming their ancestral holds.

The obverse is a stern reminder to the workers of Grumhardhûm that they must not become complacent, reading "It is required to read the labels and consult the supervisor before manipulating any controls". The message on the rear is a notice to workers, reminding them what they should do if the great furnace beneath the forge was to ever go out. It reads "Allow the tears of the father and the fire of the mountain to flow into the furnace".

 diggy_dungeons.525.t:0 "Beneath The Cauldron\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.525.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]As the expedition travels slowly down the repaired freight elevators, they take in the sights surrounding the huge cauldron of the great forge. Metal rings of flooring similar to the top level surround the cauldron at different heights. Great pipes lead to and from the cauldron and smaller vats, forges, smithing stations and carved chambers on each floor. These floors are much better preserved and have not been infested by squatters, owing to the difficulty of reaching them. Still, the squatters managed to despoil the lower floors with rotting bodies and trash left lying near the edges of the floors and piled up in the great cauldron, thrown into the central pit with no care for the destination. Soot blankets the floors and walls of each level, crunching underfoot and leaving ugly black stains behind. Below the huge cauldron on the bottom floor lies a fine mesh, still smouldering and belching strange vapours. The great furnace below has not completely extinguished even after millenia of disuse, leaving the whole of Grumhardhûm swelteringly hot. Some engineers of the expedition shudder, imagining working here when the furnace was still at full blast.\n\nOnce the repaired elevators touch the bottom floor for the first time, the expedition's scouts dart off to explore the depths of Grumhardhûm. A ring of engraved steel surrounds the mesh on the bottom floor, though it is difficult to see through the ankle-high piles of dust, bones, soot and metal scraps that have collected over time. A rough stone tunnel is the only exit in the walls of the bottom floor, in line with the entrance gate far above. The scouts who entered the tunnel return blackened with soot and panting for breath. They descended in a gentle sloping spiral, approaching the smouldering furnace beneath the mesh. Their exploration was halted by magma pouring lazily from cracks above and in the walls, covering the huge steel bridge in front of them. As far as they could tell the bridge is still intact but the magma must be cleared to gain access to the furnace.\n\nAfter reviewing the structure and pipeworks of the forge, the engineers of the expedition have determined the magma blocking the bridge should be flowing into the furnace below. Something is blocking the pipes into the furnace and causing an overflow of magma. How the forge is still smouldering without the heat from the magma is unknown, but irrelevant for now. Judging by the inscriptions that remain on each level the penultimate level is the best bet to clear the magma. Somewhere on that floor are the controls to manage the flow of magma, and water used to generate steam, into the furnace below. The scouts look to the expedition leader, wondering where to search first."
 diggy_dungeons.525.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The expedition exits the chamber, returning to the soot-strewn penultimate level of the forge. Everyone settles down, leaning against walls and pipes to catch their breath as best they can in the sweltering heat of the forge. After just a few minutes of respite, the expedition leader calls out the order to begin exploring the opposite side of the floor."
 diggy_dungeons.525.a:0 "We will explore the rooms on the left side."
 diggy_dungeons.525.b:0 "We will explore the rooms on the right side."

 diggy_dungeons.526.t:0 "Complex Controls\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.526.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The left side of the penultimate level is home to a series of small control chambers. All these chambers were once almost identical, containing pipes rising up from the floor and into the ceiling of each, adorned with various valves and levers. Now the control chambers are a spectrum from almost untouched to no more than a pile of rubble in a doorway. Unfortunately the inscriptions above each room have long since worn away, making it difficult to tell what purpose even the intact control rooms serve. After a fruitless search for any more clues to each room's purpose, the expedition leader dispatches an engineer and a mage to the bottom floor. With a combination of divination and mechanical knowledge, they locate the pipes buried in the rock that run to the furnace and follow them back up into the chamber that controls them.\n\nAt first it appeared that the expedition was out of luck - the chamber the engineer pointed to was one full of rubble. After a little excavation, however, it was clear that the rubble was from the partial collapse of only one wall. With some improved braces a further collapse is prevented, and once the rubble is cleared out the expedition leader can walk through the open path into the control chamber. Mercifully, the pipes and controls were not touched by the collapse and are still mostly intact.\n\nThere are only three controls on the pipes, a pair of iron valves surrounding a strange reddish lever. The valves were once coloured too - there are small flecks of paint still stuck to the rear of them. It seems that the left valve was once a peculiar light green, while the right valve was a deep yellow colour. Aside from the pipes running up the back wall and these controls, the room is an empty uniform cube only large enough for a handful of people. Alone in the room for now, the expedition leader ponders his options."

Unusually, there's a large carved stone tunnel as well. It's long but narrow, with smoothly curving walls and tipped with a simple stone staircase leading upwards. Curiously the air in the tunnel is comparatively cooler and pleasantly humid, more akin to a beach holiday than a desert trek. The scouts sent into the tunnel are forced to return soon, however. The flickering orange light from above the staircase and the chaotic magic energies swirling in the tunnel can only mean one thing - an infestation of magma oozes.\n\nThe cool air means there is very little magma in the tunnel, so each ooze should be comparatively weaker than the ones experienced on the first floor. Still, the tunnel is far too narrow for a large force to enter, whereas the amorphous oozes will have no problem utilising their numbers. Ignoring the men clamouring to stand in the refreshing draft, the expedition leader begins selecting a team to clear the tunnel."

The difference between the work of nature and of man is striking after so long spent in the painstakingly carved rooms of the forge. It appears that once a great underground river flowed through the cavern, slowly carving peculiar channels into the rock. The sound of flowing water still echoes down the cavern, but a bronze dam blocks the river. The dam stretches most of the way up to the cavern ceiling, with four great gates lined along the base. These four gates are open, but clogged with debris from upstream, leaving the underground riverbed bone dry. Scouts sent to climb the dam report that there's a bubbling stream on the other side, not quite large enough to fill the whole cavern even with the dam open. At the other end of the underground riverbed, the floor suddenly drops and huge pipes snake off in different directions to deliver water to the forge.\n\nIt seems that the dam gates were once controlled mechanically, as they are far too heavy to be operated by hand. They also had retractable grates, presumably to prevent them being clogged as they are now, but they were either torn from the dam or left up. The valves and levers on the dam itself do nothing now, so the debris will need to be cleared another way."

 diggy_dungeons.539.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Surviving members of the expedition lay sprawled across the ground on the other side of the bridge, panting and heaving for breath. The great ooze took many expedition members as it surged down the bridge, but it was reluctant to step off the bridge and away from the pool of magma. This moment of hesitation was just barely enough to allow the men time to counter attack. They fought desperately, even throwing their shields and armour at the ooze to try and delay it. After a truly herculean effort from every member the ooze suddenly broke apart, returning to an inert pool of magma and slipping from the bridge. Now, as the expedition leader takes stock of those who have survived, he notices a battered steel chest covered in weakly glowing runes left behind on the bridge. The magma must have swallowed this chest long ago but thanks to the protective runes carved upon it the contents are still intact. Inside are a cache of ancient dwarven scriptures and engravings. Such well preserved artefacts are vanishingly rare, worth their weight in gold."

Weapons sank into the great ooze and spells bounced off ineffectually while it continued its inexorable advance. As the expedition was nearing complete defeat, the last survivors retreated beyond the threshold of the steel bridge. Opting not to leave the vicinity of the magma pool, the ooze instead slipped away over the bridge and disappeared. It took several hours before a scout braved the bridge again, reporting that the ooze appears to have left the expedition alone for now."

With their footwork impaired by the magma and communication difficult over the clamour, the expedition cannot effectively organise to combat the oozes together.

Not allowing the oozes any time to group up, each new ooze is quickly set upon and crushed into a magmatic paste. Nevertheless the oozes reappear almost as quickly as they're destroyed. As new oozes spawn the flow of magma from above slows, and the oozes slow too. Eventually, having used most of the pooled magma, the last oozes are destroyed by the expedition. With the magma gone the bridge is much easier to traverse, making the job of the clerics tasked with collecting the oozes dropped loot much simpler."

Each expedition member is tied to ropes ready to catch them when the blockage has been weakened enough and decides to suddenly break free. After several close calls with rushing water and flying debris, and a little extra help from water mages standing on top of the dam, the blockages are cleared and water once again flows through the riverbed."

As the other expedition members drop their tools to help, the debris at the other gates breaks free as well!

The wards on the doors were powerful, still weakly flickering after so long, but have been nullified. The inscriptions hastily scrawled across the door are an epithet, repeated in several ancient scripts including old dwarven. "They all roughly mean Old Fire Lord, Aldorlbûr in the forge's native dwarven", explains a linguist brought along to examine the doors. A noble with such a title doesn't appear in any ancient chronology, though it hardly matters as any living being would have perished after so long locked inside the furnace. As the last bars are torn from the doors they swing open eerily of their own accord, revealing the top of a scorched steel staircase.\n\nA blast of hot stale air from inside the doors washes over the waiting expedition members. The heat throughout the forge has worsened since the previous expedition cleared the magma from the bridge into the furnace, but this extra heat is the final straw. Everyone stumbles back from the doors hoping to escape the dry heat licking at their bodies. Ignoring the orders of the expedition leader, most of the men continue to retreat back as far as they can from the doors and towards the comparatively cooler forge.\n\nWith the whole expedition gathered before the bridge again, the mood is low and many wish to turn back before even entering the furnace.

This situation certainly qualifies, but the system of levers and pulleys that once held the chains have been left a twisted wreck. The expedition leader has no choice but to send men to hold the bare chains, with naught for leverage but their muscles. They will need to hold the floodgates up for as long as possible to maximise the amount of water to the emergency pipes. Volunteers line up on alternating sides of each chain, wrapping their hands with whatever they can for protection.

Suddenly great gouts of water burst from a pipe and douses those on the nearest chain. This shock breaks those men's concentration, with their floodgate crashing back down just seconds later. The other floodgate soon follows, leaving the volunteers gasping on the slick cavern floor. They did more than enough - water rushes through the pipes surrounding them and a growing pool of water spreads through the cavern.

Also on the platform are groups of high powered water jet cannons. They are in disrepair, cracked and dripping oily fluid onto the platform, but do not look unfixable. Having men manning these cannons from such a vantage point would be invaluable.

As the expedition members cry out and lunge for safety, it pauses rather than pressing on and instead circles around. Is it toying with the expedition, or genuinely wary of them? It matters not, as the torn pipes open a new escape route for the expedition. Escaping unscathed from the elemental while it is so close will be difficult, especially as it becomes inured to such a strategy. Still, surely it's a better option than rushing to a fiery demise?"

Aside from some minor scratches and burns, the runes are pristine but nevertheless mostly inactive. The floor surrounding the cage is much different, bearing deep scorch marks and gouges. Discarded pieces of armour have been welded to the floor by the heat and are surrounded by piles of ash, the remains of whatever unfortunate souls surrounded Aldorlbûr when it escaped. The wards must have been extremely powerful to keep the elemental imprisoned for so long and to sustain such little damage as it ravaged the area as revenge. If the mages can repair the minor damage and provide enough mana to the wards again, the cage should be capable of suppressing the fire elemental even when it is at nearly full power.

Though each of Aldorlbûr's attacks are blindingly quick they also open the fire elemental to counterattack while their fiery body is stabilising again. It is difficult to ignore the desperate cries of those Aldorlbûr has left badly burned but there is nothing the expedition's medics can do until the fire elemental is clear. Wary of overextending, both the expedition and Aldorlbûr circle each other, making occasional probing attacks. If physical attacks do any lasting damage to Aldorlbûr is unknown, so instead these serve as a distraction for mages to strike. It has been struck with various spells and projectiles by now, but unfortunately very little water. The elemental dances and dodges around even a drop of water, evaporating it or hurling pipes at it rather than meeting it with its body. This fear is easily exploited to create openings, but the unlucky person who sent the water is usually targeted and incinerated by the elemental soon after. After what feels like hours, the fire elemental is finally beginning to show signs of weakness. Its body no longer burns so painfully bright and its attack range and speed have lowered noticeably.\n\nIn a stroke of luck, a brave mage blasts a jet of icy water at Aldorlbûr right as it rears up for another attack. Unable to dodge, the water strikes its centre mass and this time it visibly recoils with a horrible shriek. The mage is reduced to ashes soon after, but the damage has been done. Clearly rattled by such a hit, Aldorlbûr is now squarely on the defensive. It no longer initiates attacks, opting instead to slip and weave away from all projectiles, waiting for men to overcommit. Focusing entirely on defence makes the elemental near untouchable - after some time of this with precious few hits it begins to regain confidence, apparently unaware of the expedition's true plan. Hoping to corral it back towards the cage to seal it back for good by utilising its newfound wariness, the expedition have been carefully guiding Aldorlbûr with their attacks.

 diggy_dungeons.564.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The last mage stumbles back, drained, as the wards hum back to life. Even the non magical members of the expedition can feel the wards tugging at them, yearning to imprison and stifle them. The cage emits a steady, comforting hum as well. The strength of the cage is not in doubt to anyone - if Aldorlbûr can be brought here then it will certainly be defeated and imprisoned once more. The only problem is it is equally aware of this, likely preferring to die fighting than end up in there for another eternity. Stiil, the newly powered up cage provides more than a measure of comfort."

 diggy_dungeons.565.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Golems of iron, steel and stone protrude from the ground before the expedition. Frozen in the throes of a desperate defence, these are clearly abandoned security golems. Many appear to have survived Aldorlbûr's wrath in good condition, but closer inspection reveals that their joints have fused from the heat. Their mana batteries are still serviceable but they will need to be carefully repaired before being recharged to be of any use. An army of unflinching golems mostly immune to the heat will be the perfect distraction, so long as they can actually fight. As engineers and mages try to co-operate on the golems, men keep a nervous watch on them. The golems should recognise the fire elemental as the bigger threat and assist the expedition, but who knows what time and decay has done to their programming."
 diggy_dungeons.565.a:0 "An unsettling window into the past."

 diggy_dungeons.566.t:0 "The Final Push\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.566.d.1:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Aldorlbûr is beginning to tire of fighting. All the while it was trapped in that horrible prison it had yearned to burn and scorch with impunity. Outside, no being should be equal to it! Pure fire reduces all to ashes, nothing should be able to quench it! Yet the accursed mortals that invaded its cavern stubbornly defy its flames, refusing to submit. At first Aldorlbûr was glad to have new playthings, but they now behave more like an insect buzzing incessantly about its head. Hounded by the expedition, as much as Aldorlbûr does not want to admit it, they are beginning to wound it deeply. Occupied with hate and visions of sending the expedition to a fiery demise, Aldorlbûr doesn't feel the tugging on its very being until it is too late - it stands before its most hated cage with the expedition to its back. No escape.\n\nThe expedition watches as the fire elemental freezes in place before the runic cage, finally understanding their plan. It sends tendrils of flames to the walls and cage, but they suddenly recoil before even halfway. Its prideful demeanour has collapsed and its fear of the cage is palpable, but with the exit blocked by the expedition Aldorlbûr has no choice but to attack them once more. This time, it won't be holding back."
 diggy_dungeons.566.d.2:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Aldorlbûr is deceptively close to the runic cage, but by no means is the final stretch the simplest. Many have perished to it already, as it has turned into a flaming bulwark with the last of its strength. Denying the expedition the satisfaction of victory, Aldorlbûr would clearly rather be reduced to cinders than return to the cage. Nevertheless, to come this far and fail here is unacceptable. "It is worse off than we are! Look, its desperation is clear. It needs only one more push, just one strong strike! Just once more!" cries the expedition leader as the exhausted elemental rears up for another wave of fire."

 diggy_dungeons.567.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]The lead engineer calls a stop to the expedition's fleeing. He has found a long wall of intact pipes that run up to, among other places, the sprinklers set into the cavern ceiling. Raining water down on the elemental would be an excellent assistance, if only it was that simple. The pipes invite flashbacks of the forges control rooms, covered in valves and levers of obscure purpose. The expedition leader has no choice but to assign volunteers to follow each pipe junction and determine what it carries and where. Painstakingly slowly, the engineers construct a mental map of the pipes in the cavern, turning valves and pulling levers to try and fill the sprinklers above once more."

 diggy_dungeons.568.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Expedition members jerk back in surprise as light suddenly burns in a golem's eyes. It straightens up, pulling itself from the indent it has made in the floor and examining the expedition. After a few tense moments, everyone relaxes as the golem makes no moves to attack. Soon it is joined by a handful of its fellows in an unnaturally straight line, awaiting the expedition leader's orders."

 diggy_dungeons.569.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Aldorlbûr has dug itself into the floor, trying to keep the expedition back with pure heat. It won't retreat so much as an inch towards the cage. Waves and waves of blue fire roll off of the elemental, forcing the expedition to take cover wherever they can. Finally, the waves of fire stop and men step out to finish the exhausted elemental. They are met with another wall of flames - it was a trap! Those at the front absorb most of the heat leaving those at the back physically unharmed, but the shock of seeing their fellows burn to death under their noses stuns them completely. With the expedition routed temporarily, Aldorlbûr sags again - this time, it really is exhausted. So painfully close to victory, the expedition leader picks himself up and rallies the expedition for another push."
 diggy_dungeons.569.a:0 "Fight, to the last man!"

 diggy_dungeons.570.t:0 "The Furnace, Reignited\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.570.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]Step by step, the expedition closes in on Aldorlbûr. No longer can it incinerate them lazily as it had so many of their fellows, its paltry blasts of fire easily blocked by mages and shields. It is clear that Aldorlbûr is now the hunted rather than the hunter. Within touching distance now, a barrage of arrows, magical projectiles and even canteens of water are hurled at the fire elemental as it desperately hangs on to the rocky floor. Losing purchase, the gravity of the cage finally exceeds its strength and it begins to slip further and further back towards it. Desperate otherworldly shrieks and cries unlike anything the expedition have heard echo around the cavern. As a last ditch effort, Aldorlbûr abandons its form and looses fiery tendrils to all corners of the room and ceiling searching desperately for an escape. Hacking at the living fire with swords and dousing it with water weakens the tendrils, which flicker, then disappear completely. Reduced to nothing more than a fist sized orb of fire, Aldorlbûr is jerked back into the runic cage as the front swings shut with a conclusive crash.\n\nThe triumphant expedition still lays upon the floor hours later, completely exhausted from their efforts. Before them Aldorlbûr seethes inside the runic cage, trapped again for the foreseeable future. With the whole of the Grumhardhûm cleared and free of danger and the ancient source of heat sealed once again the complete reconstruction of the forge can begin in earnest. Well, another group can head down to the furnace to do the repairs in earnest - the expedition members will be looking forward to their pay and a nice long vacation somewhere cool after this harrowing experience."
 diggy_dungeons.570.a:0 "Truly, a cage fit for a lord."

 diggy_dungeons.571.t:0 "A Comforting Shower\n[DungeonOverlayBackground]"
 diggy_dungeons.571.d:0 "[DungeonOverlay]"There!" exclaims the lead engineer as he turns the last valve with a flourish. Immediately the sprinkler directly above blasts the floor around them with foul water, and he scrambles to turn the valve back off as unlucky expedition members around him are splashed. At least now they know the sprinklers certainly work - and with unexpected force! Activated at the right time, they will be a great boon against Aldorlbûr."

Studying a largely unreadable map that hangs by the wayside of another entrance you quickly find out that 915-B seems to connect to a much larger structure, as this is just an - albeit quite large - advanced post and storage facility meant to deliver goods to the main production and control facilities ahead through a large cargo tunnel.

Quite a few cocoons that seem to hang in the distance and that seem awfully recent. He barely has time to shout out a warning, though, as suddenly a dozen gigantic spiders descend upon you.

As you inspect the remnants of the attackers afterwards you notice a few small tracks that were left by the faster, more dangerous security automatons and follow them to their source - a small storage and maintenance area well-hidden behind a small side shaft that houses not only spare parts galore but a large amount of gems that were seemingly used to power the spheres!"

From surprisingly lavish furniture dotting the corners to astutely put together walkways leading to other rooms, you just now begin to notice how gifted the workforce in this workshop really was. Several, previously locked doors are now open to you and your gaze lingers on two options, neatly displayed by a sign above two peculiar doorways: "The Forge", with a promise of uncovering the technological marvels that may lie dormant in this complex; or the "Gem Storage", which makes many in your groups ecstatic with its allure of endless riches."

And true enough, you enter a workshop full of filigrane tools, smaller workstations and a few truly large gems that truly defy all expectations you had for this place. They are so enormous that their height tops the largest men in your force and their worth is beyond mortal comprehension. You immediately try to search for ways to split and transport them away from this place, when you suddenly notice something strange… the stones seem to have moved. And not only that, the air in this place seems to be filled with a strange vibrato.. Now highly alert, you begin to ready your weapons, but it is already too late.
