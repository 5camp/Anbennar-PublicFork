[Y90.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has requested our support in the conquest of the city of Jindeshi and its surrounding fields and hills. The people of Tuiista Jaal wish for better grazing lands for their livestock and more luxuries for their ruling figures.

Y91_northern_yan_unification_desc:0 "When we sent emissaries to rebellious Northern Yan provinces to demand they cease their rebellion, they never returned. When we sent emisaries to rebellious Northern Yan provinces to ask what it would take for them to cease their rebellion, some returned with demands, others never returned. It seems a part of the rebellious towns demand we invest into the regions through development projects. We should appease those we can, and slaughter those who resist.

Thus their demands are as fractured as their people, the only common thread we could discover was that they all desired gainful employment. As such we have agreed to aid some locals in establishing workshops. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

Y91_forest_yan_unification_title:0 "Forest Yan Unification"
Y91_forest_yan_unification_desc:0 "The Forest Yan people care about a select few things: the right to their faith and being able to export their tea. As they view us as threatening both of these rights, many of the traditionalist nobles are thus unwilling to negotiate. The ones that are willing demand a few things: They want to diversivy their production economy with Lapulan rainforest lumber and want the state to aid in the acquiring of the sapplings, which the Yanglam try to maintain a monopoly on. Perhaps we can placate the old guard by improving their tea yields. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

It is now up to us to unite these people within our growing empire. Not only do we have ample claim to the lands of Pinghoi as the true heir to Zhuhungwok, we also have the duty to protect all Yan people. Not to mention the strategically vital positions they hold, from which we could exert pressure upon the Rahen gulf."

Y91_distant_cousins_title:0 "Distant Sisters"
Y91_distant_cousins_desc:0 "With the former lands of Pinghoi now in our grasp, our distant sisters are once more united and we grow ever closer to a empire that represents all Yan.

 birb.1.t:0 "The Faceless Queen"
 birb.1.d:0 "The Nuugdan Tsarai have long been the most powerful family of the Shuvüüsh, though it has stood fractured since the Sun Elves reigned over us, their officials fostering rivalries between the clans to keep us divided and weak. What was once the terror of Yanshen devolved into warring tribes and hordes, more of a threat to themselves than anybody else. Recently however, we saw the rise of Kusheng Nurgai of the Bagaatun clan. Her horde conquered and united the Nuugdan Tsarai within a few short years, and she earned the respect of her people by reining in the other two families and finally bringing down the fortifications of Yemájinún, which had repelled us for centuries. All of the world now trembles, for we have crowned a Faceless Queen."
 birb.1.a:0 "Long reign the Nuugdan Kusheng!"
 birb.2.t:0 "Winds Of Change"
 birb.2.d:0 "Odheongu is a region rich in history and tradition, much of it quite similar to our own due to the influence of the first kingdom of Guwaamud. It is us who are being influenced this time around however, our children are raised by Odheongun retainers and educated by native mentors, many speak their language before learning the tongue of their ancestors. As the Shuvüüsh of Guwaamud embrace more and more of the eastern culture, we are faced with a decision; either we embrace the winds of change and continue to nurture this trend to ingratiate ourselves with our subjects, or we uphold our own traditions which allowed our forefathers to conquer this land."
 birb.2.a:0 "We are Odheongun!"
 birb.2.b:0 "We should not associate ourselves with the weak."
 birb.3.t:0 "More Than A Queen"
 birb.3.d:0 "With the unfortunate passing of the great conqueror Kusheng Nurgai Bagaatun, the Shuvüüsh people have lost one of their finest. As thousands make their way to Zougzengom to visit her grave and pay their respect, the locals begin constructing a temple aroung it. Whilst the people were in mourning however, the shamans of the Saanorgegh communities were busy asking the spirit world for guidance. To their surprise a familiar voice answered. The Faceless Queen is still alive, up there! She has ascended to godhood according to a majority of the shaman and in her honor a new mask has been carved to be laid upon her grave, one devoid of all details, a true facless mask for a faceless queen. Several rumors are floating around the clans, such as that she has married one of the three brothers, with shamans bickering about which one it could be. She is quickly becoming the preferred deity for all Shuvüüsh women as they pray to her for guidance.\n\n §R The Faceless Queen is now available as a personal deity to all queens who control her temple in Zougzengom.§!"
 birb.3.a:0 "A new god for all Shuvüüsh"
 birb.4.t:0 "The return of Bhengudak"
 birb.4.d:0 "With the reconquest of Odheongu, ancient scriptures about a long forgotten god named Bhengudak have been unearthed from libraries all over the land. These documents speak of a god that used to watch over the previous iteration of Guwaamud for over 800 years, the god being the old former of Guwaamud, ascended. This god has long been viewed as either dead or dormant. With the recent departure of our previous ruler however, this is no longer the case. Shamans across the lands have reported that they can now commune with a new being, one which identifies itself as Bhengudakhnar, which means Bhengudak and child. It seems as if the two Shuvüüsh rulers that both have formed Guwaamud, both in the past and in the present, have now merged into a single living deity. As shamans receive visions of their messages, a new mask has been carved to represent him. Both rulers were famous in life for subjugating those of other faiths and conquering with impunity, as such, those of us who would rather spread the faith by the bird than the mouth are beginning to claim him as their guiding deity. \n\n §R Bhengudakhnar is now available as a personal deity to all monarchs who control his temple in Bhengutai.§!"
 birb.4.a:0 "An old god reborn, for all Shuvüüsh"
 birb.5.t:0 "The Great Reformer"
 birb.5.d:0 "The spirit of the great former of Daxugo is so strong that when they passed, they seem to have joined the three brothers to guide our people through these tumultuous times. Daxüüsgen, more commonly known as Daxüü, the new god, who claims to hold the domains of reform and rationality is quickly gaining a following under the more religion-minded intellectuals of the empire. The shamans have carved a new mask, representing a tiger, as the harimari already embody the teachings of this new deity and were a prominent part of their administration in life.\n\n §R Daxüüsgen is now available as a personal deity to all monarchs who control their temple in Duzhekho.§!"
 birb.5.a:0 "A new god for all Daxug"
 birb.6.t:0 "Paws On Paper"
 birb.6.d:0 "The Harimari of Jòndáng have petitioned [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to let them assume vital governmental positions, citing reports stating that all successful Yansheni states benefit from the same agreement. Should we let these tigerfolk into our government?"
 birb.6.a:0 "They make a good case"
 birb.6.b:0 "Send these tigers back to the jungle"
 birb.7.t:0 "Fate of the Kobolds"
 birb.7.d:0 "Several Goldscale kobolds have come to court to petition [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to let them fulfil several court positions. How should we react?"

 birb.7.b:0 "I guess"
 birb.7.c:0 "Their incessant tunneling would collapse our tents"
 birb.8.t:0 "Rüng Oedek Migration"
 birb.8.d:0 "Just as we had agreed right before our war against Daengun, the people of Rüng Oedek are beginning to migrate to the fertile fields of Segang, whilst their clans hand the steppes over to our clans."
 birb.8.a:0 "More land for all Shuvüüsh"
 birb.9.t:0 "The First Oni Purge"
 birb.9.d:0 "As our armies kill Oni after Oni, word quickly spreads from surrounding lands that these hills rich in natural resources are open for settling, as such, many Shuvüüsh and Hill Yan have bought land from the state, which is benifical to us because they aid in killing the few Oni still present."
 birb.9.a:0 "These hills will be ours"
 birb.10.t:0 "The Last Oni Purge"
 birb.10.d:0 "As our armies begin exterminating the last of the Oni in these hills, more people settle the hills, paying us a tithe for the land. Soon the entire region will be dominated by humans, not Oni."
 birb.10.a:0 "These hills are ours"
 birb.11.t:0 "The Raheni Plight"
 birb.11.d:0 "With the looming hobgoblins of the Command, it is evident that the Shamadhan and Kamtarhid people need our aid, they have been subjugated by the hobgoblins and some of them have fled to these hills since before we even knew they existed. Now they turn to us, asking us for aid in reconquering their ancestral lands. Even some of their nobility seems to be in these hills."
 birb.11.a:0 "Sure, we'll 'liberate' your lands"
 birb.12.t:0 "Greasing Rüng Palms"
 birb.12.d:0 "The time has come to integrate the Rüng people into our government. To convince the clan leaders to take the final step towards unification, we must however grease some palms."
 birb.12.a:0 "Give them enough so no tension ever arises"
 birb.12.b:0 "Give them enough so they accept, and no more than that"
 birb.13.t:0 "The Rünsukhi"
 birb.13.d:0 "Where the steppes of the Shuvüüsh meet the vast sands of the beyond, where our ancestors fled from almost 15 centuries ago, nothing ever comes back. Occassionally a spirit wanders in from the desert and is turned back by local shamans. However, recently a group of families have arrived at the capital, claiming to be from the desert and begging for food. Their old fashioned clothing, thick accents and archaic vocabulary seem to support their claim. Their clan leader says he represents a larger group of desert people, who all call themselves Rünsukhi. They say that the dry summers of the past few years have forced them to seek help. They wish to join our great nation, they desire to purchase food from our markets and they claim to have access to gold mines and salt lakes to pay for it. All he asks for their loyalty is some relief food to make it through these months."
 birb.13.a:0 "The state will buy them some relief food"
 birb.13.b:0 "The local herders will donate some livestock"
 birb.14.t:0 "The Clan of Tolcuug"
 birb.14.d:0 "The leader of a Rünsukhi clan which claims ownership over the mountain of Tolcuug has arrived at [Root.Capital.GetName]. They have heard of the benefits that came to the previous clan that has made contact with the Shuvüüsh and wish to also join our growing nation. However their ground is more fertile than even ours, so they do not wish for food relief, instead the clan leaders demand recognition as an official clan."
 birb.14.a:0 "Simply bribe the leader"
 birb.14.b:0 "Grant them their recognition"
 birb.15.t:0 "The Egoongaam clan"
 birb.15.d:0 "Another Rünsukhi clan has petitioned us for aid. They claim to get by in regards to food and combating the spirits that roam their lands, but they fear aggression from what they claim to be horsemen to their north. They offer us fealty and ask for protection and wish for us to repair ancient fortifications to their north."
 birb.15.a:0 "We'd like to see these 'horsemen' first"
 birb.15.b:0 "Let us construct fortifications against these 'horsemen'"
 birb.16.t:0 "The Soolinúk Clan"
 birb.16.d:0 "As our grasp over our ancestral homeland increases, yet another Rünsukhi clan calls for a tighter bond. The Soolinúk clan, who live near Lake Kokesal, wish to swear fealty to us, but demand the right to self government of local affairs for one generation."
 birb.16.a:0 "We will grant them their wishes"

 birb.19.d:0 "With the Brown orcs now roaming Rahen without a realm to represent and protect them, they are beginning to seek refuge within a variety of states. One such roaming clan has asked us if it can gain employment in our military. Shall we allow them to serve on our front lines?"
 birb.19.a:0 "They shall make fine frontline support companies for our infantry"
 birb.19.b:0 "They will only destabilize our military"
 birb.20.t:0 "Damestear Of The East"
 birb.20.d:0 "With the demand for coal in our empire satisfied, the artificers begin pressuring the government for access to damestear. However this poses a problem: There aren't that many damestear deposits around. We are urged time and time again by the artificers to secure more damestear deposits and to explore rumors for potential deposits."
 birb.20.a:0 "We shall consider these requests"
 birb.21.t:0 "Joining The International Gommo"
 birb.21.d:0 "With our empire quickly becoming the continental leader of manufacturing, we have caught the attention of the International Gommo, a Cannorian institution led by Gnomes and Cannorian humans. They have sent a delegation for a formal agreement of cooperation, how shall we respond?\n\n§R If we accept, expect a portion of our most industrious provinces to gain gnomish communities of various sizes.§!"
 birb.21.a:0 "A profitable agreement"
 birb.21.b:0 "Reject the proposal, we resist the colonisers"
 birb.22.t:0 "The Daxugo Rebellions"
 birb.22.d:0 "Whilst our previous ruler, who is now guiding the Daxug people from their throne in the spirit realm managed to subjugate the Yan and surpress their opposition to our regime by fear and the fresh memory of their conquest alone, our new monarch [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] does not have these advantages. As they began their rule, it became very clear that the Yan were not pacified, they were merely biding their time. All across Daxugo, small revolts from disloyal peoples are spreading like bushfires. Will [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] overcome this period of unrest or will the realm collapse like that of ancient Guwaamud?"
 birb.22.a:0 "I will not falter"
 birb.23.t:0 "Purged And Pacified"
 birb.23.d:0 "With the majority of the Yan people punished for their crimes against peace and order we are approaching the end of an era of unrest. With local leaders either executed and replaced by puppets or placated by meeting their demands, we have convinced the majority of the previously rebellious peoples to stop throwing their sons onto our spears. It cost hundreds of thousands of lives to both our proud soldiers and our taxpayers, but in the end we came out on top."
 birb.23.a:0 "We must never let this happen again"
 birb.24.t:0 "New Month, New Rebellion"
 birb.24.d:0 "'If they resist to their subjugation, make them regret it so much that all of Haless sees the smoke' -Nurgai Bagaatun in her living years to her generals. With a new rebellion trying to crush our achievements, our riders ready their birds whilst our Dìguómáo polish their spears. A new battle is upon us."
 birb.24.a:0 "It is time to blow some smoke"
 birb.25.t:0 "Harimari Loyalists"
 birb.25.d:0 "As our government has been kind to the previous conquerors of this land, the Harimari, some of them have also been kind to us. As they see our empire go through the very rebellions that they went through, they guide us with old lessons and bring relief to our state with their vast treasuries, no doubt to ask for favors later."
 birb.25.a:0 "Their help is most welcome"
 birb.25.b:0 "We are not in a position to refuse"
 birb.26.t:0 "Rünsukhi Loyalists Gather"
 birb.26.d:0 "When we first received word that the Rünsukhi wanted to aid us in our war, we dismissed their messages as they are relatively few in number. But when they said they could muster five thousand men, we naturally accepted."
 birb.26.a:0 "They shall form their own regiments"
 birb.26.b:0 "They shall replenish our existing armies"
 birb.27.t:0 "The Menjaeng Cult"
 birb.27.d:0 "As our grip on the island of Somyonghon has been strengthening for the past few months, we have been receiving words from our administrators on the island through our naval routes that the isle has a sizeable religious cult. They follow the ancient teachings of a man named Menjaeng, who united the Odheongu long ago. On the mainland he is primarily seen as a historical figure, but on this isle he is seen as a god. The locals claim he watches over them and they have erected a large circular wooden shrine around his final resting place, where he died of old age after uniting his homeland and negotiated a peace between the spirits and the humans on the isle. It wasn't long before some of our officials on the isle had their own personal shrines of him in their houses and soon after our shamans sent a delegation to try and communicate with him, they came back claiming he is a strong ascended spirit, worthy of veneration as he has the wisdom to unite both spirits and humans. They set out to carve a mask and establish a new cult through our lands. \n\n §R Menjaeng is now available as a personal deity to all monarchs who control his shrine in Somyonghon.§!"
 birb.27.a:0 "A spiritualist cult preaching tolerance? It could be worse."
 birb.28.t:0 "Daxug War Hero Volunteers"
 birb.28.d:0 "An old general, renowned across all of the realm has traveled to Duzhekho to join the military. He doesn't walk very well anymore and his retirement on the countryside betrays his Shuvüüsh accent in our Daxug military. However he is an invaluable asset to the war effort. How shall we use him?"
 birb.28.a:0 "Accept him as a general"
 birb.28.b:0 "Have him travel the land, urging men to enlist"
 birb.29.t:0 "Odheongu Insurgency"
 birb.29.d:0 "As our armies are occupied in the southern reaches of our realm, the Odheongu have used this opportunity to rise up and try for independence! Luckily they are far less ferocious in their rebellion than the Yan. However a lot of food for the army is cultivated in this region, making this insurgency have a negative impact on our supply lines."
 birb.29.a:0 "We should send a force to deal with them"
 birb.30.t:0 "A Moment Of Weakness"
 birb.30.d:0 "With our archnemesis Daxugo embroidered in a grand civil war, now would be the time to strike!"
 birb.30.a:0 "We aren't ready"
 birb.30.b:0 "It is time"
 birb.31.t:0 "The Rebellion Hurts Our Agriculture."
 birb.31.d:0 "The Rebellion is destroying our crops! The need to fight keeps farmers away from their fields, while the fruits of their labour are being plundered by bandits and the enemy. In a normal war we could prevent the worst by using the surplus of unravaged provinces, but now this system is breaking down as the entire country is taking sides, spreading combat everywhere and creating a situation where villages don't know which side their neighbours are a part of."
 birb.31.a:0 "Why can't the peasants eat cake?"
 birb.31.b:0 "Just import food from abroad."
 birb.31.c:0 "Someone must be hoarding food, we must seize it."
 birb.32.t:0 "Our Soldiers Desert"
 birb.32.d:0 "The hardships of war and destruction of our grain surplus has led to many a civilian to abandon their homes. With no end in sight, our soldiers are also starting to desert in large droves."
 birb.32.a:0 "Let them go"
 birb.32.b:0 "Increase their pay"
 birb.32.c:0 "Our soldiers need the food more than our peasantry"
 birb.33.t:0 "Rebel Army Leader Captured"
 birb.33.d:0 "We have routed one of the rebel armies and in the process, have captured a group of noble instigators. Even now, many of the children are crying while the men and women alike beg for mercy and leniency. How shall we respond to their pleas?"
 birb.33.a:0 "Pardon them"
 birb.33.b:0 "Execute them and loot their holdings"
 birb.34.t:0 "The Daxugo Rebellion"
 birb.34.d:0 "A large rebellion has broken out in Daxugo, with various ethnicities fighting for independence. We could try helping the rebels in order to weaken them, but if they end up losing this might strain our relations."
 birb.34.a:0 "Send some unruly subjects to the rebels as 'volunteers'."
 birb.34.b:0 "Give the rebels some monetary aid."
 birb.34.c:0 "We don't help rebel scum."
 birb.35.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Intervention"

 birb.35.a:0 "We will not forget this."
 birb.36.t:0 "Administrative Advisor Betrayal"
 birb.36.d:0 "We took a risk when we hired [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] as our administrative advisor, having grown up in one of the cultures currently embroidered in the rebellion against our state. As it turns out it was a wrong bet, as [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has now disappeared with some of our documents, funds and pride."

 birb.37.d:0 "We took a risk when we hired [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] as our diplomatic advisor, having grown up in one of the cultures currently embroidered in the rebellion against our state.
