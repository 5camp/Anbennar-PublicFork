[Y90.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has requested our support in the conquest of the city of Jindeshi and its surrounding fields and hills. The people of Tuiista Jaal wish for better grazing lands for their livestock and more luxuries for their ruling figures.

 birb.1.t:0 "The Faceless Queen"
 birb.1.d:0 "The Nuugdan Tsarai have long been the most powerful family of the Shuvüüsh, though it has stood fractured since the Sun Elves reigned over us, their officials fostering rivalries between the clans to keep us divided and weak. What was once the terror of Yanshen devolved into warring tribes and hordes, more of a threat to themselves than anybody else. Recently however, we saw the rise of Kusheng Nurgai of the Bagaatun clan. Her horde conquered and united the Nuugdan Tsarai within a few short years, and she earned the respect of her people by reining in the other two families and finally bringing down the fortifications of Yemájinún, which had repelled us for centuries. All of the world now trembles, for we have crowned a Faceless Queen."
 birb.1.a:0 "Long reign the Nuugdan Kusheng!"
 birb.2.t:0 "Winds of Change"
 birb.2.d:0 "Odheongu is a region rich in history and tradition, much of it quite similar to our own due to the influence of the first kingdom of Guwaamud. It is us who are being influenced this time around however, our children are raised by Odheongun retainers and educated by native mentors, many speak their language before learning the tongue of their ancestors. As the Shuvüüsh of Guwaamud embrace more and more of the eastern culture, we are faced with a decision; either we embrace the winds of change and continue to nurture this trend to ingratiate ourselves with our subjects, or we uphold our own traditions which allowed our forefathers to conquer this land."
 birb.2.a:0 "We are Odheongun!"
 birb.2.b:0 "We should not associate ourselves with the weak."
 birb.3.t:0 "More than a queen"
 birb.3.d:0 "With the unfortunate passing of the great conqueror Kusheng Nurgai Bagaatun, the Shuvüüsh people have lost one of their finest. As thousands make their way to Zougzengom to visit her grave and pay their respect, the locals begin constructing a temple aroung it. Whilst the people were in mourning however, the shamans of the Saanorgegh communities were busy asking the spirit world for guidance. To their surprise a familiar voice answered. The Faceless Queen is still alive, up there! She has ascended to godhood according to a majority of the shaman and in her honor a new mask has been carved to be laid upon her grave, one devoid of all details, a true facless mask for a faceless queen. Several rumors are floating around the clans, such as that she has married one of the three brothers, with shamans bickering about which one it could be. She is quickly becoming the preferred deity for all Shuvüüsh women as they pray to her for guidance."
 birb.3.a:0 "A new god for all Shuvüüsh"
 birb.4.t:0 "The return of Bhengudak"
 birb.4.d:0 "With the reconquest of Odheongu, ancient scriptures about a long forgotten god named Bhengudak have been unearthed from libraries all over the land. These documents speak of a god that used to watch over the previous iteration of Guwaamud for over 800 years, the god being the old former of Guwaamud, ascended. This god has long been viewed as either dead or dormant. With the recent departure of our previous ruler however, this is no longer the case. Shamans across the lands have reported that they can now commune with a new being, one which identifies itself as Bhengudakhnar, which means Bhengudak and child. It seems as if the two Shuvüüsh rulers that have formed Guwaamud, both in the past and in the present, have now merged into a single living deity. As shamans receive visions of their messages, a new mask has been carved to represent him."
 birb.4.a:0 "An old god reborn, for all Shuvüüsh"
 birb.5.t:0 "The Great Reformer"
 birb.5.d:0 "The spirit of the great former of Daxugo is so strong that when they passed, they seem to have joined the three brothers to guide our people through these tumultuous times. Daxüüsgen, more commonly known as Daxüü, the new god, who claims to hold the domains of reform and rationality is quickly gaining a following under the more religion-minded intellectuals of the empire. The shamans have carved a new mask, representing a tiger, as the harimari already embody the teachings of this new deity and were a prominent part of their administration in life."
 birb.5.a:0 "A new god for all Daxug"
 birb.6.t:0 "Paws on Paper"
 birb.6.d:0 "The Harimari of Jòndáng have petitioned [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to let them assume vital governmental positions, citing reports stating that all successful Yansheni states benefit from the same agreement. Should we let these tigerfolk into our government?"
 birb.6.a:0 "They make a good case"
 birb.6.b:0 "Send these tigers back to the jungle"
 birb.7.t:0 "Fate of the Kobolds"
 birb.7.d:0 "Several Goldscale kobolds have come to court to petition [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to let them fulfil several court positions. How should we react?"

 birb.8.t:0 "Rüng Oedek Migration"
 birb.8.d:0 "Just as we had agreed right before our war against Daengun, the people of Rüng Oedek are beginning to migrate to the fertile fields of Segang, whilst their clans hand the steppes over to our clans."
 birb.8.a:0 "More land for all Shuvüüsh"
 birb.9.t:0 "The First Oni Purge"
 birb.9.d:0 "As our armies kill Oni after Oni, word quickly spreads from surrounding lands that these hills rich in natural resources are open for settling, as such, many Shuvüüsh and Hill Yan have bought land from the state, which is benifical to us because they aid in killing the few Oni still present."
 birb.9.a:0 "These hills will be ours"
 birb.10.t:0 "The Last Oni Purge"
 birb.10.d:0 "As our armies begin exterminating the last of the Oni in these hills, more people settle the hills, paying us a tithe for the land. Soon the entire region will be dominated by humans, not Oni."
 birb.10.a:0 "These hills are ours"
 birb.11.t:0 "The Raheni Plight"
 birb.11.d:0 "With the looming hobgoblins of the Command, it is evident that the Shamadhan and Kamtarhid people need our aid, they have been subjugated by the hobgoblins and some of them have fled to these hills since before we even knew they existed. Now they turn to us, asking us for aid in reconquering their ancestral lands. Even some of their nobility seems to be in these hills."
 birb.11.a:0 "Sure, we'll 'liberate' your lands"
 birb.12.t:0 "Greasing Rüng Palms"
 birb.12.d:0 "The time has come to integrate the Rüng people into our government. To convince the clan leaders to take the final step towards unification, we must however grease some palms."
 birb.12.a:0 "Give them enough so no tension ever arises"
 birb.12.b:0 "Give them enough so they accept, and no more than that"
 birb.13.t:0 "The Rünsukhi"
 birb.13.d:0 "Where the steppes of the Shuvüüsh meet the vast sands of the beyond, where our ancestors fled from almost 15 centuries ago, nothing ever comes back. Occassionally a spirit wanders in from the desert and is turned back by local shamans. However, recently a group of families have arrived at the capital, claiming to be from the desert and begging for food. Their old fashioned clothing, thick accents and archaic vocabulary seem to support their claim. Their clan leader says he represents a larger group of desert people, who all call themselves Rünsukhi. They say that the dry summers of the past few years have forced them to seek help. They wish to join our great nation, they desire to purchase food from our markets and they claim to have access to gold mines and salt lakes to pay for it. All he asks for their loyalty is some relief food to make it through these months."
 birb.13.a:0 "The state will buy them some relief food"
 birb.13.b:0 "The local herders will donate some livestock"
 birb.14.t:0 "The Clan of Tolcuug"
 birb.14.d:0 "The leader of a Rünsukhi clan which claims ownership over the mountain of Tolcuug has arrived at [Root.Capital.GetName]. They have heard of the benefits that came to the previous clan that has made contact with the Shuvüüsh and wish to also join our growing nation. However their ground is more fertile than even ours, so they do not wish for food relief, instead the clan leaders demand recognition as an official clan."
 birb.14.a:0 "Simply bribe the leader"
 birb.14.b:0 "Grant them their recognition"
 birb.15.t:0 "The Egoongaam clan"
 birb.15.d:0 "Another Rünsukhi clan has petitioned us for aid. They claim to get by in regards to food and combating the spirits that roam their lands, but they fear aggression from what they claim to be horsemen to their north. They offer us fealty and ask for protection and wish for us to repair ancient fortifications to their north."
 birb.15.a:0 "We'd like to see these 'horsemen' first"
 birb.15.b:0 "Let us construct fortifications against these 'horsemen'"
 birb.16.t:0 "The Soolinúk Clan"e
 birb.16.d:0 "As our grasp over our ancestral homeland increases, yet another Rünsukhi clan calls for a tighter bond. The Soolinúk clan, who live near Lake Kokesal, wish to swear fealty to us, but demand the right to self government of local affairs for one generation."
 birb.16.a:0 "We will grant them their wishes"
 birb.16.a:0 "We will simply bribe the clan leader"
