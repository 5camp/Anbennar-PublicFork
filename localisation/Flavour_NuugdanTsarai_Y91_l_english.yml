Y91_tuiista_jaal_horde_desc:0 "Ever since the great Kusheng Nurgai Bagatuun united the three major clans, diplomats have been trying to increase the cohesion of the clans.

[Y90.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has requested our support in the conquest of the city of Jindeshi and its surrounding fields and hills. The people of Tuiista Jaal wish for better grazing lands for their livestock and more luxuries for their ruling figures.

Y91_start_oni_genocide_desc:0 "The time has come to purge these horned monsters, to this end we should lay siege to their capital and destroy their seat of power. \n\n §R Our advisors are drafting plans to use the Kamtarhid and Shamadhan minorities on the historical border with the Command to set up vassal states, as such they advise against attempting to make those border provinces a core part of our administration.§!"

Y91_prepare_seconds_title:0 "Prepare Seconds"
Y91_prepare_seconds_desc:0 "Yemàjinun and the fortress of Heisèbì have been described by clan leaders as vital acquisitions to the realm.

Because of her influence these creatures are often seen as cute by the Shuvüüsh, and the lucky properties of their scales make them even more desirable.

It is time we ensured the supply."

Y91_artificery_stimulus_title:0 "Artificery Stimulus"
Y91_artificery_stimulus_desc:0 "The artificers need more coal, that is the conclusion of the report which rests upon the desk of [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap].

Y91_northern_yan_unification_title:0 "Northern Yan Unification"
Y91_northern_yan_unification_desc:0 "When we sent emissaries to rebellious Northern Yan provinces to demand they cease their rebellion, they never returned. When we sent emisaries to rebellious Northern Yan provinces to ask what it would take for them to cease their rebellion, some returned with demands, others never returned. It seems a part of the rebellious towns demand we invest into the regions through development projects. We should appease those we can, and slaughter those who resist. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

Y91_hill_yan_unification:0 "Hill Yan Unification"
Y91_northern_yan_unification_desc:0 "Some of the Hill Yan have started an open revolt against the state, their hilly lands making them difficult to fight. Some prominent figures have refused negotiation, but others have responded well to the reparations paid during the Daxugo Reform. They claim that all they need to sway support is some funds to ensure all Hill Yan can be gainfully employed. We should appease those we can, and slaughter those who resist. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

Y91_river_yan_unification_title:0 "River Yan Unification"
Y91_river_yan_unification_desc:0 "As our emissaries make their way up and down the Yanhe, bringing word back from local noblity in some of the richest cities in Haless, the situation is clear: The locals have seen a sharp decline in trade since our conquest and they demand independence our large investments into the region, demands include repairing the Golden Highway, expanding markets and clearing the river from rebel blockades.

Y91_coastal_yan_unification_desc:0 "Our efforts to negotiate with the Coastal Yan nobility has not been in vain, we now have a large list of demands, some petty, some reasonable, and all of them expensive. A significant portion of the Coastal Yan nobility will lay down arms and attempt to pacify their populace if we ensure their coasts are once again secure from pirates, the same agreement they made with the previous two empires that conquered them. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

Y91_hill_yan_unification_title:0 "Hill Yan Unification"
Y91_coastal_yan_unification_desc:0 "The Hill Yan people are a divided one, a portion of the populace is fiercely loyal to us as we have aided many in their liberation from the Horned Ogres. Others yet still cling to their previous overlords or still remember the razing of Jinqiu and Jindeshi. Thus their demands are as fractured as their people, the only common thread we could discover was that they all desired gainful employment. As such we have agreed to aid some locals in establishing workshops. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

Y91_forest_yan_unification_title:0 "Forest Yan Unification"
Y91_forest_yan_unification_desc:0 "The Forest Yan people care about a select few things: the right to their faith and being able to export their tea. As they view us as threatening both of these rights, many of the traditionalist nobles are thus unwilling to negotiate. The ones that are willing demand a few things: They want to diversivy their production economy with Lapulan rainforest lumber and want the state to aid in the acquiring of the sapplings, which the Yanglam try to maintain a monopoly on. Perhaps we can placate the old guard by improving their tea yields. Acquiring someone who understands their culture to lead the negotiations would be a good idea."

Y91_pings_people_desc:0 "When Ping Shuang, founder of Pingoi and wife to the famous late king Jyuk left Zhuhungwok with her fleet, she single handidly created the largest Yan diaspora. It is now up to us to unite these people within our growing empire. Not only do we have ample claim to the lands of Pinghoi as the true heir to Zhuhungwok, we also have the duty to protect all Yan people. Not to mention the strategically vital positions they hold, from which we could exert pressure upon the Rahen gulf."

Y91_distant_cousins_title:0 "Distant Sisters"
Y91_distant_cousins_desc:0 "With the former lands of Pinghoi now in our grasp, our distant sisters are once more united and we grow ever closer to a empire that represents all Yan. Now is the time to use the strategic positions previously held by the Pinghoi pirates to drain the Rahen gulf of its wealth and exert influence on Rahen and Sarhal alike!"

Y91_formalize_gommo_membership_title:0 "Gommo Membership"
Y91_formalize_gommo_membership_desc:0 "Let us join together with the international community of scientific states, so that we may enjoy even more cooperation between our great nations. \n\n §R Expect a portion of our most industrious provinces and their surrounding lands to gain gnomish communities of various sizes.§! \n\n §R Such a grand restructuring of our artificery infrastructure would disturb any research currently underway, it might be best to wait until any current inventions are done being researched.§! "

Y91_finish_mainland_conquest_title:0 "Conquer Odheongu"
Y91_finish_mainland_conquest_desc:0 "If we wish to be considered the legitimate rulers of Odheongu, we must drive Daengun into the sea. Displaying our strength in such a way would certainly bring more Shuvüüsh to these lands and aid us in controlling the locals and integrating them in Guwaadun culture."

Y91_develop_economy_title:0 "Develop Odheongu"
Y91_develop_economy_desc:0 "Odheongu is a land rich in potential, the Menjeotaen, Chimbija and Sangsogha do not know how good they have it. Their land is fertile and fit for cultivation of tea, their coast brimming with fish and their mountains are laden with gold. Developing this land and increasing our state revenue would both aid ourselves financially and strengthen our grasp upon these lands, which will aid us in integrating them into our superior Guwaadun culture."

Y91_build_Bhengudakhnar_temple_title:0 "Bhen-Ak Temple"
Y91_build_Bhengudakhnar_temple_desc:0 "This land is a foreign one, instead of protecting themselves against harmful spirits, they aim to strike uneasy truces with them and letting them posses their shamans. These people are sick at worst and misguided at best. We must cleanse this land of their vile beliefs and cease their consortion with evil spirits. Let us build a grand temple to Bhengudakhnar, right in Bhengutai."

Y91_somyonghon_cult_title:0 "Somyonghon Temple"
Y91_somyonghon_cult_desc:0 "The isle of Somyonghon is home to many spirits the Bangujonsi consider to be cornerstones of their faith. It is also the only place where one can clearly commune with what perhaps can be considered the leading spirit of their faith, Menjaeng. This paired with the isle being closer linked to the spirit world than almost anywhere else and the abundance of ancient ruins makes it a worthy of a temple, so that our people of different faiths may benefit from this isle." 

Y91_capture_facestealer_title:0 "Capture A Facestealer"
Y91_capture_facestealer_desc:0 "If we are to rid the Khaashalg desert of those wretched facestealing spirits and obtain vengeance for our ancestors, we must first capture one so we can study it. To that end we should assemble a team of experts to capture one. We will need war-shamans, foreign mages, Rünsukhi guides and a infantry regiment to protect them in the unforgiving desert."

Y91_kill_facestealer_title:0 "Killing A Facestealer"
Y91_kill_facestealer_desc:0 "Killing the captured facestealer has proven harder than previously thought. It truly seems that Jaal was a god even in life, being able to slay one singlehandedly. Even a team of shamans and foreign mages have proven inadequate to slay the spirit. Some of the foreign mages speak of so called Spirit Hunters, from Xianjie. We should seek them out."

Y91_facestealer_killers_title:0 "A New Type Of Soldier"
Y91_facestealer_killers_desc:0 "If we are to wage war against the facestealers, we shall need to train our own spirit hunters. Let us make the necessary investments."

Y91_clear_first_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse The Lands"
Y91_clear_first_runsukhi_desc:0 "With our newly trained Spirit Hunters and experienced shamans we can finally stand a chance against the facestealers. Let us send our armies into our piece of the Khaashalg desert and rid it of those wretched spirits!"

Y91_clear_mountain_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse Tolcuug hills"
Y91_clear_mountain_runsukhi_desc:0 "The people of Tolcuug and Bhalooxi look at the land west of them with envy. The Rünsukhi land we have cleansed of the vile Facestealers is becoming more liveable every week. There are almost no Facestealers left there, and as a result there are less sandstorms and there is less death. The people of the Tolcuug hills now desperately wish for the same. We should prepare the armies."

Y91_clear_egoongaam_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse Egoongaam"
Y91_clear_egoongaam_runsukhi_desc:0 "The Egoongaam clan of the most northern reach of our domain, seperating us from the horsemen, has petitioned us to rid them of the Facestealers, like we did for their kinsmen."

Y91_clear_lakefolk_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse Soolinúk Lands"
Y91_clear_lakefolk_runsukhi_desc:0 "The lands of the Soolinúk are both the most fertile and the most plagued by the Facestealers, the Soolinúk clan claims to know where they come from, saying that the closer you get to the Unarkhürigh Mountains, the more Facestealers you see, especially near the central mountain. They beg us to rid them of their Facestealers and afterwards seek out a potential point of origin in the mountains."

Y91_into_the_mountain_title:0 "Into The Mountain"
Y91_into_the_mountain_desc:0 "It is time to amass our armies at the pass the Soolinúk clan mentioned, the one where the Facestealers go into and come out of, which we have had patrols cover ever since we cleansed the Khaashalg desert. The Rünsukhi have set up a logistical network for our troops to be supplied when they are guarding the pass, even in great numbers. We have trained more Spirit Hunters, hired foreign mages,trained both our shamans and our men and with a powerful mage [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to lead the expedition, morale will be higher than ever. We are ready, it is time to get our revenge."

Y91_inward_perfection_title:0 "Inward Perfection"
Y91_inward_perfection_desc:0 "With The Daxugo Rebellions behind us, it is now time for a period of reform, a period of calmth and inward perfection. Let us stabilize our grasp upon the Yan, fortify our borders, reform our military, bolster our economy and rework our laws and institutions." 

Y91_great_daxugo_legal_code_title:0 "Great Daxugo Legal Code"
Y91_great_daxugo_legal_code_desc:0 "The Yan people have as many sets of laws as they have surnames. Before us lies the seemingly insurmountable task of unifying all these people under one great book of law. The Great Daxugo Legal Code must be familiar to all Yan, yet serve Daxugo foremost. Let is start by establishing a definition of a citizen and set up racial laws."

Y91_articles_on_government_title:0 "Articles On Government"
Y91_articles_on_government_desc:0 "The advisors of the realm have constantly been bothering [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] about details like local autonomy, representation of citizenry, nobility and clans. It seems we cannot continue writing our laws before first establishing how the state itself will function."

Y91_war_and_faith_title:0 "War & Faith"
Y91_war_and_faith_desc:0 "If [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has learned anything during these formative months, it is that the codes on war and on faith have the potential to tear our great Diguó in two, much like the time of the Daxugo Rebellions. The traditional Dìguómáo of the steppes demand the military law be written according to our ancient ways, whilst the National Academy has many influential members arguing for quite the opposite. If those laws weren't divisive enough, the religious code finalisations are scheduled for this month as well."

Y91_introduce_code_title:0 "Introduce Legal Code"
Y91_introduce_code_desc:0 "With the Great Daxugo Legal Code finalised, it is time to publish the codes and make sure every governor has access to a copy. Let us hope our millions upon millions of subjects all find the codes satisfactory."

Y91_outward_gaze_desc:0 "Our state is now in such a position where most issues inherent to our historical predicaments have been solved, and as such we can no longer be content with just our new homeland. Our state hungers for expansion, our mages hunger for artifacts and our generals wish to prove themselves across Halann. It is time to gaze outward, like a true empire."

Y91_plugging_the_holes_title:0 "Plugging The Holes"
Y91_plugging_the_holes_desc:0 "If our state is going to stand the tests of time, we must ensure that any war fought to preserve ourselves is undertaken which as many advantages as possible. To this end we should ensure that our forts cover all angles of minor angles of approach, so we can afterwards focus on the main angle, the East-Yanshen border."

Y91_the_yanshen_wall_title:0 "East-Yanshen Wall"
Y91_the_yanshen_wall_desc:0 "With the minor holes in the border of our mainland plugged, it is time to focus on our eastern lands. Regardless of whether it is deemed neccessary right now, it will no doubt be a vital investment in the long run: A great line of forts along the East-Yanshen border, from the Demon Hills to Bianfang and from Bianfang to the Phokhao Range."

Y91_city_line_title:0 "Yanhe City Line"
Y91_city_line_desc:0 "The great cities of the Yanhe are home to the plurality of our subjects, no river in the world has more people along it, as far as we know. We should make sure these cities are all fortified in such a way the can not easily fall into enemy hands, whilst also ensuring enemy supply lines are disrupted, should they attempt to cross over the main vein of our empire."

Y91_steppe_line_title:0 "The Steppe Line"
Y91_steppe_line_desc:0 "The temples in Zougzengom require protection from foreign invaders, and the great city of Jòndáng could use likewise protection, through the hills of Shuzhàn. Let us create a northern line to ensure our empire has one more line of forts to call upon in times of need."

Y91_increase_tea_production_title:0 "Increase Tea Production"
Y91_increase_tea_production_desc:0 "Some resources and products are very scarce in our land, tea is not one of them. Whatever tea we do not drink ourselves, and we drink a lot, always finds willing buyers abroad. If we wish to establish ourselves forever as the main tea producers of the world, some investments are in order."

Y91_reform_gold_standard_title:0 "The Gold Reforms"
Y91_reform_gold_standard_desc:0 "Gold is an incredibly valuable resource, it adorns our temples, beautifies our regalia and is used as a secondary currency throughout the realm. This last fact is a problem however, according to some of the most prominent economic advisors. Inflation related to trading in an ever increasing supply in gold will continue to decrease the trust in our currencies and devaluate our monetary systems. It is time to regulate the trading in gold and form new laws to halt inflation."

Y91_expand_sugarfarms_title:0 "Expand Sugarfarms"
Y91_expand_sugarfarms_desc:0 "Unlike Tea, sugar is a resource often imported into our realm from abroad, the only significant sugar producing region in our realm are the cane fields of Lamseko.

Y91_silk_road_title:0 "The Silk Road"
Y91_silk_road_desc:0 "Our grasp on the silk market is a tight one, only the sericulture of Sramaya in Bhuvauri can hope to compete in both quality and quantity. Our nobility wears silk exclusively grown near the Yanhe, yet other nobles in Haless shamefully wear robes of low quality imitations or even cloth and wool. Let us elevate the entire continent to a higher state of fashion by bolstering our production and spreading word of our silk to far lands, across the ancient road of Jaher."

Y91_anti_corruption_reforms_title:0 "Corruption Reforms"
Y91_anti_corruption_reforms_desc:0 "Our administration consists of many different peoples: Daxug, Odheongu, Yan and even Harimari fill posts in our administration.

Y91_war_tax_reform_title:0 "War Tax Reforms"
Y91_war_tax_reform_desc:0 "In times of war, our people are often subjected to additional taxation, to fuel the war effort. This system is not uncommon around Haless, nor is the unrest that often comes along with it. A new system, where taxes are lowered in times of peace, paired with propaganda and new laws, can hopefully allow our army to be funded without riling up the citizenry or requiring soldiers to go door to door to collect war taxes."

 birb.1.t:0 "The Faceless Queen"
 birb.1.d:0 "The Nuugdan Tsarai have long been the most powerful family of the Shuvüüsh, though it has stood fractured since the Sun Elves reigned over us, their officials fostering rivalries between the clans to keep us divided and weak. What was once the terror of Yanshen devolved into warring tribes and hordes, more of a threat to themselves than anybody else. Recently however, we saw the rise of Kusheng Nurgai of the Bagaatun clan. Her horde conquered and united the Nuugdan Tsarai within a few short years, and she earned the respect of her people by reining in the other two families and finally bringing down the fortifications of Yemájinún, which had repelled us for centuries. All of the world now trembles, for we have crowned a Faceless Queen."
 birb.1.a:0 "Long reign the Nuugdan Kusheng!"
 birb.2.t:0 "Winds Of Change"
 birb.2.d:0 "Odheongu is a region rich in history and tradition, much of it quite similar to our own due to the influence of the first kingdom of Guwaamud. It is us who are being influenced this time around however, our children are raised by Odheongun retainers and educated by native mentors, many speak their language before learning the tongue of their ancestors. As the Shuvüüsh of Guwaamud embrace more and more of the eastern culture, we are faced with a decision; either we embrace the winds of change and continue to nurture this trend to ingratiate ourselves with our subjects, or we uphold our own traditions which allowed our forefathers to conquer this land."
 birb.2.a:0 "We are Odheongun!"
 birb.2.b:0 "We should not associate ourselves with the weak."
 birb.3.t:0 "More Than A Queen"
 birb.3.d:0 "With the unfortunate passing of the great conqueror Kusheng Nurgai Bagaatun, the Shuvüüsh people have lost one of their finest. As thousands make their way to Zougzengom to visit her grave and pay their respect, the locals begin constructing a temple aroung it. Whilst the people were in mourning however, the shamans of the Saanorgegh communities were busy asking the spirit world for guidance. To their surprise a familiar voice answered. The Faceless Queen is still alive, up there! She has ascended to godhood according to a majority of the shaman and in her honor a new mask has been carved to be laid upon her grave, one devoid of all details, a true facless mask for a faceless queen. Several rumors are floating around the clans, such as that she has married one of the three brothers, with shamans bickering about which one it could be. She is quickly becoming the preferred deity for all Shuvüüsh women as they pray to her for guidance.\n\n §R The Faceless Queen is now available as a personal deity to all queens who control her temple in Zougzengom.§!"

 birb.4.t:0 "The return of Bhengudak"
 birb.4.d:0 "With the reconquest of Odheongu, ancient scriptures about a long forgotten god named Bhengudak have been unearthed from libraries all over the land. These documents speak of a god that used to watch over the previous iteration of Guwaamud for over 800 years, the god being the old former of Guwaamud, ascended. This god has long been viewed as either dead or dormant. With the recent departure of our previous ruler however, this is no longer the case. Shamans across the lands have reported that they can now commune with a new being, one which identifies itself as Bhengudakhnar, which means Bhengudak and child. It seems as if the two Shuvüüsh rulers that both have formed Guwaamud, both in the past and in the present, have now merged into a single living deity. As shamans receive visions of their messages, a new mask has been carved to represent him. Both rulers were famous in life for subjugating those of other faiths and conquering with impunity, as such, those of us who would rather spread the faith by the terrorbird than the mouth are beginning to claim him as their guiding deity. \n\n §R Bhengudakhnar is now available as a personal deity to all monarchs who control his temple in Bhengutai.§!"

The shamans have carved a new mask, representing a tiger, as the harimari already embody the teachings of this new deity and were a prominent part of their administration in life.\n\n §R Daxüüsgen is now available as a personal deity to all monarchs who control their temple in Duzhekho.§!"

 birb.13.d:0 "Where the steppes of the Shuvüüsh meet the vast sands of the beyond, where our ancestors fled from almost 15 centuries ago, nothing good ever comes out. Occassionally a spirit wanders in from the desert and is turned away by local shamans. However, recently a group of families have arrived at the capital, claiming to be from the desert, and they're begging for food. Their old fashioned clothing, thick accents and archaic vocabulary seem to support their claim. Their clan leader says he represents a larger group of desert people, who all call themselves Rünsukhi. They say that the dry summers of the past few years have forced them to seek help, the rivers run dry and they were forced to venture further from the homes to find food, losing many clansmen to the face stealing spirits in the process. They wish to join our great nation, they desire to purchase food from our markets and they claim to have access to gold mines and salt lakes to pay for it. All he asks for their loyalty is some relief food to make it through these months."

As they began their rule, it became very clear that the Yan were not pacified, they were merely biding their time. The various Maskbreaker factions twart our government at every opportunity. All across Daxugo, calls to rebellion from disloyal peoples are spreading like a fire on the steppe, turning larger and larger.

They follow the ancient teachings of a man named Menjaeng, who united the Odheongu long ago. On the mainland he is primarily seen as a historical figure, but on this isle he is seen as a god. The locals claim he watches over them and they have erected a large circular wooden shrine around his final resting place, where he died of old age after uniting his homeland and negotiated a peace between the spirits and the humans on the isle. It wasn't long before some of our officials on the isle had their own personal shrines of him in their houses and soon after our shamans sent a delegation to try and communicate with him, they came back claiming he is a strong ascended spirit, worthy of veneration as he has the wisdom to unite both spirits and humans.

Some our own, some belonging to the Rünsukhi and others mages from Yanshen, hired with bags of crowns. They all have two things in common, they are all wearing masks and they are all filled with fear, whether they showed it or not. After a few minutes the first duststorm appears, a small whirlwind draws near the regiment in the front. When the dust settles a Facestealer is attempting to pull off the masks of some men, as others pelt it with projectiles and spells. Soon the spirit crumbles to sand, becoming one with the desert and the regiment continues to move forward, sustaining minor casualties. \n\n The army walks for a whole hour without anything happening, when suddenly a sandstorm grows in the distance, nearing fast. As it draws closer it gets bigger and bigger, as smaller whirlwinds join together. Some men ready their weapons, others adjust their masks. A shaman tries to calm his terrorbird, a mage turns around and starts running... [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes a deep breath and prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] very soul."

An hour later the last wounded man was on a cart home and the army pushed onward to the mountain, adamant to end this scourge once and for all. \n As the army approached the mountain and fought a few Facestealers here and there, emboldened by their previous victory, it became clear they were protecting a cave entrance. \n As [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] made [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way inside, with their most experienced combatants in tow, a mage cast a illuminating spell and the group started moving in, a full regiment beind them. \n\n After a few minutes of walking and dealing with a couple of Facestealers who shrieked at the group when they charged, like mothers defending their babies, the cave walls became home to a disturbing feature, actual human faces were embedded into the wall, made from flesh and stuck in a permanent expression of pain and panic. As the party went further down into the cave, the density of these faces on the walls, ceiling and floor increased, until the faces were so plentiful the shamans had to discuss if continuing to trample on our ancestors was sacrilege or permitted. \n After what felt like an hour of walking over the faces of their dead kinsmen the cave finally widened into a final room. Its walls completely filled with faces. In the center of the room were hundreds of small, almost childlike Facestealers, who gave little resistance to spirit hunters. It was finally over, the home of the Facestealers was now under human control. The Shamans agreed that the cave will be taken care of by them, to ensure no sacrilege is committed against the faces of our, or anyone's ancestors. The army returned home victorious, but will anyone ever be the same?"

 birb.47.t:0 "The Retreat"
 birb.47.d:0 "As a Facestealer larger than any other ever seen tears the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] apart and rips off their face, a wave of fear spreads through the army. Men drop their fighting stance and run, riders get dismounted by their birds and horses, formations break, shamans break down into prayer and mages begin to teleport out. A spirit hunter hopelessly tries to hold the beast back, losing her head in the process. As generals regain control of the army, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is already lost, and so is the day. Without purpose, the generals decide to return home, letting the Facestealers feast on the corpses, hopefully their new faces will satiate them for generations to come."

Our advisors have observed states from all across Halann and have come up with four ways to represent the people, now that village elder is nothing more than an honorary title. \n\n Parliamentarism would empower our cities by granting them local representation, but the abolishment of the privileges of the nobility, followed by their incorporation into the parliament is likely to ruffle some noble feathers."

The Dìguómáo of the steppes, our noble caste of warriors, traditionally consisting of spearmen and birdriders who trace their lineage back to the Shuvüüsh of old, stand firmly against the reforms proposed by the council of the Daxugo Army Academy in Jianshu. The Dìguómáo warrios of the north demand we integrate their rights to raiding into the legal code and make the birdriders a more prominent part of the military. The Jianshu Military Council, which represents the more modern segment of our military, consisting of prominent generals and Yan military advisors demand we restrict looting to a minimum and modernize our military away from the terrorbirds, who they describe as archaic.

Further investigation has shown that there is a vast network of Lefthand Path mage circles spread out through the hilly lands, all united under a single banner, calling themselves the Maskhexers.

Some rebels seem to be organizing around the symbol of a shattered mask, if rumors on the street are to be believed. Various factions have sent demands to our government, radicals say there will be bloodshed unless we grant them independence, whilst the Yan nobles and guilds put forth more agreeable, yet expensive demands. Our administrative advisors have tried to compile an exhaustive list of demands made by the somewhat more reasonable Yan factions, theorizing that meeting some of them will aid the stability of the realm and will aid in calming down the expected period of unrest when [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] passes away. \n\n §R The Lesser Nobles of the Northern Yan demand we aid them in reforming their farm estates to be more modern.

(6 Hill Yan provinces with workshops)§! \n\n §R The merchants of the Coastal Yan demand we aid them in the protection of their ships against pirates by building a large enough fleet and securing trade around feiten.§! \n\n §R The Merchant Guilds and city councils of the River Yan bring forth the most demands, ranging from repairing the Upper and Lower Yanshen Golden Highway, to expanding centers of trade and renovating marketplaces so goods can more easily be traded.§! \n\n §R The tea cultivators of the Forest Yan demand we aid them in increasing their profit through magical plant growth during their distant harvesting season and some wish to diversify their businesses towards Lapulan Exotic Wood, asking us to help them acquire sapplings by increasing our influence in the area.
