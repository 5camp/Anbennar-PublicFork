 G81_concealed_knowledge_title:0 "Concealed Knowledge"
 G81_concealed_knowledge_desc:0 "The Dumran Vustarvarch, or Violet Library, is truly the heart and soul of Sthanan ith Vussam, its columned entrance alone, which for one to reach requires climbing hundreds of steps, is visible from every inch of the city. Built as the personal library for a particularly erudite Slaver-Noble, the library contains an immense trove of ancient documents from both before and after the ruin.
This trove is ever expanding, thanks to the efforts of the Violet Brotherhood, who painstakingly preserve and expand the library’s archives, despite the ravages of time. However, retrieving information from the library is not the easiest task – the language of the Precursors is difficult to decipher, and many ancient documents are badly damaged. By supporting the efforts of the Violet Brotherhood, we may be able to retrieve some valuable information indeed from the depths of the past.

 G81_past_and_future_title:0 "Past and Future"
 G81_past_and_future_desc:0 "Though Taychend is a land of ten thousand gods, and they have doubtless reached ascension in every way imaginable, there can be no doubt that the most patronised hero-cults are those of the warriors and conquerors – those favoured by warlords, not ordinary people. In Thektoram, however, things are slightly different – here, two powerful hero-cults stand, one dedicated to preserving the past, and one dedicated to foreseeing the future.
The Violet Brotherhood’s dream is to create a Taychend in which every elf, not just the conquerors, has a path to ascension – if that is to happen, we will have to work closely with the Cult of the Fateweaver, and, potentially, grant some of the lesser cults of Taychend some much needed support.

 G81_the_land_of_gardens_title:0 "The Land of Gardens"
 G81_the_land_of_gardens_desc:0 "The fields of Tirsin are among the most fertile in Taychend, only beaten by those of the Kalavend, and the Tirsini have certainly put their bountiful lands to use, creating a land of gardens whose beauty is renowned throughout Andeios. If we are to support our city’s growth as we bring more of Taychend under our rule, however, then it is vital that we turn those gardens to our own purposes, perhaps converting some of those flower beds into rows of maize."
 G81_city_of_violet_cloth_title:0 "City of Violet Cloth"
 G81_city_of_violet_cloth_desc:0 "Sthanan ith Vussam has always been a beautiful city, its streets are adorned with banners of violet-dyed cloth and dominated by the great library at its centre – however, as we’ve expanded, and the city has grown and grown, beauty is beginning to fade, replaced by the cold yet mighty immensity of an imperial Taychendi capital – that cannot be allowed to continue. Let’s renovate our city, restructure streets, rebuild decaying buildings and weave thousands of new violet banners so that our city can maintain its status far into the future."
 G81_a_revenge_overdue_title:0 "A Revenge Overdue"
 G81_a_revenge_overdue_desc:0 "In the death throes of the greatest classical Taychendi empire, that of the Mudaliars, it was said 10,000 bandit kings overran Taychend, claiming large swaths of the region for themselves. Most perished in the following decades, but one stood tall above all – Sibisimra. Dreaded for its might and brutality, the bandits of Sibisimra cut off the Kalavend from the south. It was only the efforts of King Eletam the Gold that stopped them, and it was an effort for which he gave his life.\n\nIf we are to reform the Dumrusvarn, the bandits of Sibisimra must be put to flight once more. It is a revenge long overdue – but that does not mean we cannot find some kinship in the warriors of the area’s forests…"
 G81_woodsmen_drills_title:0 "Woodsmen Drills"
 G81_woodsmen_drills_desc:0 "The woodsmen of the forests surrounding Sthanan ith Vussam are famed for their martial aptitude and knowledge of the terrain – but they owe much of their skills to their Sibisimran origin, having been resettled in Sthanan’s lands by Eletam after they fled from the ravages of the northern city’s bandit-kings. Since then, the two groups of woodsmen warriors have diverged greatly in terms of traditions – but perhaps this can be turned to our advantage. By levying troops from both forests, and drilling both groups together, we may be able to unite the traditions of north and south, and create something stronger in its stead."
 G81_shining_reforms_title:0 "Shining Reforms"
 G81_shining_reforms_desc:0 "The Dumrusvarn relied on a powerful standing military force, the Goldswords, to enforce their rule – a feat imitated by the Gophirans, though they expanded on our success a hundred fold with their Ironblood Army. However, it has become clear to us that the ingredients for a second Ironblood Army have been sowed in our own state. The Captains of the Goldswords have drawn up plans for the “Shining Reforms”, where we shall integrate our woodsmen levies, our professional Goldswords, and the iron-clad soldiers of Yodhanpir into one, formidable army. This process may be painful, though it will undoubtedly give us the groundwork for a powerful force that can maintain control over Taychend forever."
 G81_violet_lords_golden_captains_title:0 "Violet Lords, Gold Captains"
 G81_violet_lords_golden_captains_desc:0 "We have finally done it. Taychend is conquered, and our soldiers, reorganised and retrained, are bringing much needed stability to the region for the first time since the collapse of Gophira. But there is still the danger that we may fall as Gophira did, our newly professionalised military turning on us and bringing our new empire to ruin. A difficult thing to ward off, though one of the captains of the Goldswords thinks he has a solution – in the mould of Eletam and Elajith, perhaps a new heavenly union between the Gold and Violet can bring peace to Taychend, once and for all…"
 G81_united_against_invaders_title:0 "United Against Invaders"
 G81_united_against_invaders_desc:0 "We hold no ill will towards Kheionai civilization, and centuries of trade with them has certainly left its mark on us, but we will not stand idly by while a foreigner forces it upon us. At the Battle of Bukénthia, we faced the army of Ameion alongside Gophira and Tirsin, but when Laskaris slew Dhalikar, the King of Gophira, we were put to flight – he will not have the same luck again. With Gophira’s strength broken amongst the ruins of Kannalulthe, let us unite with our long-standing partners in Nagar Vyechei and the lands of Tirsin, from which the Violetblood dynasty first sprang, and march on Laskaris once more!"
 G81_rebirth_title:0 "Rebirth"
 G81_rebirth_desc:0 "For over 500 years, the city of Sthanan ith Vussam has had a single dream – to rebuild the Dumrusvarn, and restore the light of reason, moderation and stability to southern Taychend. Now, with our northern and eastern flanks secured, it is time to fulfil that dream. Let us march east, expel the Kheionai invaders, and secure Taychend’s future, by restoring the past!"
 G81_blood_of_iron_title:0 "Blood of Iron"
 G81_blood_of_iron_desc:0 "The Yodhanpir – the children of Yodhan – have made it their mission to live up to their namesake. In that mission, it is impossible to say that the Gophirans did not succeed, creating two gargantuan empires from their rugged home in the Iron Hills. In fact, our own dynasty has Yodhanpir blood, and still keeps many of their traditions. With that in mind, we understand the martial excellence of that people, and we know that with Yodhanpir soldiers in our ranks, we can conquer anything. So let’s take a sip of that iron-blood, and raise an army from their lands."
 G81_beneath_the_sands_title:0 "Beneath the Sands"
 G81_beneath_the_sands_desc:0 "The Vustarin, recently brought back into the fold, have taught us much, but there is still yet more to learn when it comes to the remnants of the past beneath our feet. The Sarihaddhi, masters of traversing their desert homeland, have made a living off of digging up artefacts from the dangerous relic-graveyards of their home. If we are to expand our relic operations, it may be wise to “consult” their leaders, and set up new bases of extraction on the borders of the desert."
 G81_seaward_gaze_title:0 "Seaward Gaze"
 G81_seaward_gaze_desc:0 "Vuls Tenvach, our north-easterly Thekvrystana neighbour, has never had the greatest of interactions with us. Indeed, Eletam the Gold, himself a Tenvachi general, had met his lover Elajith through Vuls Tenvach’s occupation of the city – his subsequent betrayal of his home, and the Dumrusvarn’s 200 year occupation of the city, did our relationship no favours. Even now, Vuls Tenvach’s vassal tribes come down from the coastal hills of Uyarbaid, raiding our woodland homes. The only way to put a stop to this animosity is, of course, to subjugate them for good. So let’s march with a seawards gaze, and put this rivalry to rest once and for all!"
 G81_the_scavenger_cities_title:0 "The Scavenger Cities"
 G81_the_scavenger_cities_desc:0 "The Kalavend is littered with the remnants of the past, and the scavenger guilds of that river have been dredging them up for centuries. It is no wonder, then, that our scholars have long been interested in the region – some more than others, as we found out when the ancestors of the Vustarin family left the Violet Brotherhood, seeking relics that they could turn to their military advantage. As our control over Taychend expands, and we come into contact with more of these relics, we must learn some lessons from our prodigal children – after all, the uses of the past are many indeed, and one must never close their minds to learning."
 G81_gold_and_pride_title:0 "Gold and Pride"
 G81_gold_and_pride_desc:0 "Sthanan ith Vussam has always been a centre of trade in Taychend. A cornerstone of the Old Loop that once dominated Taychendi trade, and a prominent nexus-point of the New Loop that dominates it today, with trade coming west along the Straight Road or from south to north through the Vyech. With our conquest of the Kalavend, Thektoram and Yodhanchend, we’ve conquered about three quarters of Taychend’s trade routes – it's time to overrun the rest of it."
