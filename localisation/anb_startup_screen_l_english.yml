 string_start_cannor_description:0 "Cannor is a diverse temperate land inhabited by many races such as halflings, dwarves, gnomes, kobolds and orcs, though the dominant race of the continent is humanity as well as its half-elven nobility: the scions of 400-year old pairings between elven migrants and the native human nobility.\n\nAt the center of Cannor lies the §YDameshead§!, an inland sea surrounded primarily by the §YEmpire of Anbennar§!, a giant, but largely divided, Empire that dominates the central regions of Cannor. Upon the death of an §YEmperor§! the §YImperial Electors§! select his replacement by voting. A member can become an Elector by being granted an Electorate by the current Emperor or inheriting an Elector.\n\nCountries within Anbennar (meaning 'Unity' in Elven) are allowed their own diplomacy and can even have their own subjects, but the Emperor is obligated to defend them from outside forces and can demand that they hand back §YUnlawfully Acquired Territory§! within the Empire.\n\nWhile the §YAuthority§! of the Emperor is currently low, this may change if the Emperor can strengthen his hold through §YImperial Reforms§!.\n\n[Root.start_imperial_cities_description]\n\n[Root.start_tributaries_descriptions]"

 string_start_tag_cannor:0 "A year has passed since the dynastic §YLilac Wars§!, fought between the pretenders of the imperial Grand Duchy of §YDameria§! and the victorious Kingdom of §YLorent§!, and much of Cannor lies in a period of uneasy truce and recovery.\n\nTo the west, the infamous Wine Lords of Lorent (§YMadelaire§!, §YEilísin§!, §YRubenaire§! and §YSorncóst§!) refuse to bow to their de jure liege, the King of §YLorent§!.\nTo the north, the Kingdom of §YGawed§! looks to its southern Lorentish rival with hungry eyes, eager to to become sole suzerain of the halfling §YSmall Country§! once and for all.\nIn the northwest, gnomish ambitions rise once again and a new fight to reclaim their ancestral homeland of the §YDragon Coast§! from its kobold invaders will begin once more.\nThe central Empire of §YAnbennar§! stands shaken, with its ancien regime of Damerian rule over along with its ruling half-elven House of §YSilmuna§! wiped to near-extinction. Their enemies, the Grand Duke of §YWex§! sits in the imperial throne, uplifted by Dameria's numerous enemies and scheming lords who seek to exploit the lack of Damerian hegemony.\nTo the east, the §YAge of Greentide§! rages on, with many kingdoms felled already by the endless orcish hordes, and the avatar of the disgraced God of War, §YCorin§!, recently sacrificing her life to defeat the large Greentide Vanguard and giving the §YMarcher Lords§! a fighting chance of reclaim the lost east.\n\nThe entire continent is on the verge of major changes, and it will be up to you to lead the §Y[Root.GetAdjective]§! [Root.GovernmentName] through this period."
 
 string_start_title_lorent:0 "Lorent, the Kingdom of the Red Rose"
 string_start_lorent:0 "§YPrimer§!\nLorent has long dominated the western portions of §YCannor§! (known as §YLencenor§!), even before the arrival of the elves more than 400 years ago, with all of the region de jure under the §YRuby Crown§!. Known for its bountiful vinyards and wide grasslands, §YLorent§! is both full of riches and martial horseman tradition, with the modern idea of chivalry and knighthood originating from Lorentish tales and folklore. It is a country of passion, love and beauty.\n\nThe kingdom owes its inception and name to §YLorenan the Great§!, an ancient human hero who famously defended the region from the invading §YAlenic§! ancestors of its now-rival §YGawed§!. Shortly after the elven arrival to the continent, the realm also came under guidance of the elf §YIoriel§!, the wife of then King §YRuben II§!, whom led the country to the cultural and military superpower it is today.\n\nThe country is divided into two primary cultures: §YHigh Lorentish§! (the half-elven nobility and urban human class who have fully embraced elven blood, customs and culture) and the §YLow Lorentish§! (the rural backbone of the country who are still predominantly human, though more accepting of the elvenised §YAnbennarian§! culture than its other counterparts elsewhere). In terms of other races, Lorent has long acted as suzerain for the §YRedfoot Halflings§! of the southern §YSmall Country§!, and maintain close relations with its ancient §YRuby Dwarf§! neighbours of §YRubyhold§!. The §YMoon Elf§! realm of the §YRedglades§! also lies under Lorentish control, a woodland sanctuary set up by Ioriel herself.\n\n§YRecent History§!\nThe §YLilac Wars§! have been hard on §YLorent§!, whom achieved a phyrric victory against their would-be pretenders, the former imperial house and now-extinct Grand Dukes of §YDameria§!. Despite defending the realm from external foes, §YKylian VI§! sits on a fragile throne, facing internal issues in the form of open defiance of the Wine Lords of §YMadelaire§!, §YEilísin§!, §YRubenaire§! and §YSorncóst§! who have refused to swear fealty ever since the war's end in §Y1443§!, even worse, the Duke of §YDeranne§! has also joined them in rebellion!\n\nThe halfling §YSmall Country§! remains divided between Lorent and its rival, the northern Kingdom of §YGawed§!, who had only years prior put aside their differences and defeated the halfling §YViswall§! Rebellion, partitioning the city between themselves. Peace never lasts however, and the Small Country looks to be once again a battleground between the two major forces of Cannor.\n\nTo the east, Lorent has helped install its ally during the Lilac Wars, the Grand Duke of §YWex§!, to the imperial throne of §YAnbennar§!. They say "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" but with Dameria and the House of §YSilmuna§! no longer an issue, will the Lorentish-Wexonard alliance truly last?\n\nLorent stands surrounded by vultures within and without. Whether the Kingdom of the Rose will blossom into greatness or wilt away into obscurity is up to you, my liege."
 
 string_start_religion_regent_court:0 "The Regent Court (also known as the Cannorian Pantheon) is the main religion in Cannor. It is more of a loose set of related deities than a single religion with a strict and formal hierarchy, instead with mostly autonomous temples adhering to a particular patron deity.\n\nBelief is fluid and flexible, with most people paying respect to multiple gods depending on what the worshipper wants or requires - however, most worshippers are expected to have a patron deity that they adhere to above all, usually one that is most relevant to their goal and path in life.\n\nThe Regent Court is structured like a medieval court, with Castellos taking the role of King, and his wife Esmaryal as queen. The rest of the deities are either his children (such as Adean), the offspring of his deceased siblings, or beings either created during the conflicts of aeons past or those that have risen to godhood from mortal upbringings."
