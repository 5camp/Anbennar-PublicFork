In much recent history, however, Lorent has become known as a great adopter of elven culture and customs, falling under the guidance of the elf §YIoriel§! in 1022, the wife of then King §YRuben II§!, leading to Lorent becoming the cultural and military superpower it is today.\n\nThe country is divided into two primary cultures: §YHigh Lorentish§! (the half-elven nobility and urban human class who have fully embraced the elven ways) and the §YLow Lorentish§! (the rural backbone of the country who are still predominantly human, though more accepting of the elvenized customs than its other human counterparts elsewhere). In terms of other races, Lorent has long acted as suzerain for the §YRedfoot Halflings§! of the southern §YSmall Country§!, and maintains close relations with its ancient §YRuby Dwarf§! neighbours of §YRubyhold§!. The §YMoon Elf§! realm of the §YRedglades§! also lies under Lorentish control, a woodland sanctuary established by Ioriel herself.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe §YLilac Wars§! (1348-1443) between Lorent and Anbennar has brought the kingdom to its knees. And while Lorent did emerge victorious, destroying the §YHouse of Silmuna§! and preventing them from holding the imperial throne ever again, §YKylian VI§! now finds himself at a fragile peace at home. The war saw Lorent's most powerful vassals, the §YWine Lords§! of §YMadelaire, Eilísin,§! and §YRubenaire§!, side with the Silmuna, and despite the war's end, they have now refused to swear fealty to their rightful overlord, eroding the authority of the Lorentish crown.\n\nTo the east, Lorent has installed its ally, §YLothane, the Grand Duke of Wex§!, on the imperial throne of Anbennar. In the name of unity, Kylian has wed his sister to this new emperor, hoping to use dynastic ties to control the Empire of Anbennar from within, but only time will tell if this is a match meant to last, now that the House of Silmuna, the enemy of their enemy, is no more.\n\nTo the north, the halfling §YSmall Country§! remains calm yet divided between Lorent and its eternal rival, §YGawed§!. Peace never lasts, however, and as Lorent looks to recover from the Lilac Wars, the northern eagle of Gawed begins to look south once again like the days of §YLorenan the Great§!."

For hundreds of years the Reverians have had tense relations with the kobolds through their previous border in the Gnomish Pass.

 string_start_eordand_description:0 "Eordand is a region of Northwestern Aelantir populated by Fey and Season worshipping Eordan Ruinborn Elves. It is centered around the Domandrod, an ancient and forbidden forest populated by the Fey, and around this axle the Eordan build civilizations like spokes on a wheel. The Druidic magic taught to the Eordan after the Day of the Ashen Skies broke the Eordan into five cultures: the Selpheregi who venerate Spring, the Caamas who venerate Summer, the Tuathak who venerate Autumn, the Snecboth who venerate Winter, and the Peitar who strive to maintain balance and heed the orders of their Fey masters. \n\nEordand is soaked in Druidic magical power from the Feyrealm's shadow over the Domandrod. The Eordan primarily dwell around the Domandrod, having left the custody of the Fey long ago, apart from the few chosen Gladewardens. Eordand is surrounded by seas in all directions except for a land connection in the southeast to the desolate Egasach desert, and to the east connected to the Ekyunimoy mountains. Of note are the Sarmadfar Sea alongside the Elarbarc gulf, the Glorelthir coastline, the Randrunnse gulf, and the Broken Sea to the far north studded with icebergs. /n/nThe Domandrod is a vast forest wilderness teeming with wildlife, Fey, and abberations. Within its borders the Feyrealm pokes into the Material Plane, causing fantastical and terrifying landscapes. Surrounding the Domandrod, Eordand is primarily composed of forests and grasslands pierced with rivers, many of which originate from the Domandrod. These surrounding lands may not be half within the Feyrealm, but it's magical influence is still strong, moreso than the effect of the Day of Ashen Skies. \n\nIn the western coast along the Glorelthir and Milsgelp coastline the Spring Court grows in eternal bloom, situated where the season of Spring is the strongest. Along the southern coastline of the Sarmadfar the Summer Court basks in the warmth of the sunn and the cool ocean waves, where the Summer is the strongest. In the far north the Winter Court ekes a living in the half-frozen taiga, where Winter strikes every year the strongest. North of the Spring Court, the Autumn Court's homeland along the Fogarabh wages eternal war and preparation against the Winter. \n\nEordand is dominated by the grand cities of Arakeprun and Murdkather, both being built on the bones of Precursor Ruins. Across Eordand Precursor ruins dot the landscape, some piercing the heavens while others are buried beneath the earth. From these ancient structures countless treasures can be found, some mundane while others containing vast knowledge and power."
 string_start_religion_spring_court:0 "Eordand is populated by five distinct Ruinborn cultures who disagree on the primacy of the seasons. These cultures often correspond with a Seasonal Court, such as the Selpheregi with the Spring Court, but even after conversion to another Court or Eordellon these cultures retain their physical traits and cultural values. \n\nThe Selpheregi uphold the season of Spring as the most superior season. They reside on the western coast of Eordand, centered around the ancient rebuilt Precursor city of Arakeprun. The Selpheregi are the most inquisitive and creative of the Eordan, being surrounded by Precursor ruins that inspire them to discover the secrets of the past. They often have a sense of superiority towards the other Eordan because of the flourishing wonders of their homeland. The season of Spring gives them a natural aptitude towards growing plantlife, as well as enabling them to grow flowering bushes on themselves. They have pinkish-white or light green skin and vibrant hair the color of flowers, generally long and flowing unrestrained. They often wear extravagantly dyed silk clothing and adorn themselves with amber jewelry."

These cultures often correspond with a Seasonal Court, such as the Selpheregi with the Spring Court, but even after conversion to another Court or Eordellon these cultures retain their physical traits and cultural values. \n\nThe Caamasi uphold Summer as the primary season. They reside on the southern coast of Eordand along the Sarmadfar and the Elarbarc seas. The Caamasi are renowned for being expert traders and traders, and are naturally adventurous and charismatic. They ply the seas around Eordand and beyond for new lands to discover and new people to make deals with, and the citystates of the Sarmadfar coast use these qualities to find an edge over their Caamasi and other Eordan rivals. The Caamasi are most tolerant of the Selpheregi, as they see the season of Spring as just the introduction of the primary season of Summer. The Caamasi have orange or reddish skin reminiscent of the setting sun, and have short red or brown hair. They are blessed by Summers warmth, growing taller than other Eordan, and wear short and loose cotton clothing to remain comfortable and free in their warm homeland."

They reside along the Milsgelp and the Randrunnse seas, with the former being their homeland and the latter a conquest by crusades against the Snecboth. The Tuathak are a disciplined people, ever-preparing for the hardships of winter and war by gathering vast stores of supplies through organized labor. They hold an eternal hatred of Winter and the Snecboth who worship it for the cold starving months that arrive each year, resulting in the Hibernal Crusades against the Snecboth as both revenge and a means to end the Winter. They have bright autumnal leaf colored skin in oranges, reds, and yellows that all change to brown in the winter. Their hair is typically black, a stark contrast against their normally vibrant skin. The Tuathak often wear armor or clothing that might serve for war or survival, and prefer to wear bright autumnal colored clothing."

In order to survive they are primarily semi-nomadic, migrating across their lands to where is best suited for each month of the year. These migrations have encurred the wrath of the Tuathak, who viewed them as trespassers during their migrations and have blamed teh Snecboth for their hardships caused by Winter. The Snecboth maintain strong interfamiliar and interclan relations, and prefer the calmly discuss matters instead of rashly acting with violence, but do not trust and easily help outsiders who have never helped the Snecboth. They have very pale white to slightly blue skin, long black or white hair, and primarily blue eyes. The cold winter forces the Snecboth to wear thick fur clothing for warmth, even despite their resilience to the cold."

Scattered throughout Eordand, the Peitar ever struggle to end the seasonalist heresy of the other Eordan, by force if necessary. Over the centuries of struggle and isolation from their seasonal cousins, the Peitar have grown bitter and zealous, ready to prove why they are the Chosen Servants of the Fey. The Peitar tribes tend to work together unlike the seasonalists, often allying and working together in war. Due to upholding the balance of seasons, the Peitar are not as strikingly apparent as the rest of the Eordan: they have white to darker than skin, ginger to blond braided hair, commonly wear elaborate warpaint, often have green eyes, and dress in green and brown clothing to blend into the deep forest in both humble linen and fine silk."
