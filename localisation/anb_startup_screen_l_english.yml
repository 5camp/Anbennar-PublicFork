In much recent history, however, Lorent has become known as a great adopter of elven culture and customs, falling under the guidance of the elf §YIoriel§! in 1022, the wife of then King §YRuben II§!, leading to Lorent becoming the cultural and military superpower it is today.\n\nThe country is divided into two primary cultures: §YHigh Lorentish§! (the half-elven nobility and urban human class who have fully embraced the elven ways) and the §YLow Lorentish§! (the rural backbone of the country who are still predominantly human, though more accepting of the elvenized customs than its other human counterparts elsewhere). In terms of other races, Lorent has long acted as suzerain for the §YRedfoot Halflings§! of the southern §YSmall Country§!, and maintains close relations with its ancient §YRuby Dwarf§! neighbours of §YRubyhold§!.

The war saw Lorent's most powerful vassals, the §YWine Lords§! of §YMadelaire, Eilísin,§! and §YRubenaire§!, side with the Silmuna, and despite the war's end, they have now refused to swear fealty to their rightful overlord, eroding the authority of the Lorentish crown.\n\nTo the east, Lorent has installed its ally, §YLothane, the Grand Duke of Wex§!, on the imperial throne of Anbennar. In the name of unity, Kylian has wed his sister to this new emperor, hoping to use dynastic ties to control the Empire of Anbennar from within, but only time will tell if this is a match meant to last, now that the House of Silmuna, the enemy of their enemy, is no more.\n\nTo the north, the halfling §YSmall Country§! remains calm yet divided between Lorent and its eternal rival, §YGawed§!. Peace never lasts, however, and as Lorent looks to recover from the Lilac Wars, the northern eagle of Gawed begins to look south once again like the days of §YLorenan the Great§!."

It is a land dominated by the legacy of its divine founder and his children, Elikhet and the Khet, yet always ruled by mere mortals - even Elikhet, for all his might and glory, often placed human friends on the throne of Kheterata rather than always sit upon it himself.\n\nThe blessing of the Sorrow, the magical river created by Elikhet at the height of his power and invested with much of his divine might, is the center of Kheteratan civilization - creating a bountiful, fertile heartland for the Kheteratans protected from all foes by miles upon miles of desert to the east and west. Though eventually this protection would fail in the face of gnollish and later Damerian conquests, these were always overthrown eventually and Kheterata returned to its state of splendid isolation, even if - as in the case of the Damerians - Elikhet himself had to rise from the dead to see it done.\n\nKheterata is dominated by a singular, homogenous §YKheteratan§! culture; the descendants of those tribes who followed Elikhet west to escape the grasp of the Bulwari God-Kings. Kheteratan culture is also influenced by the historical subject peoples of Kheterata, many of whom were relocated to the Sorrow; the §YDesha§! and §YKhasani§! of §YAkan§!, the §YBusinori§! of what is now §YBusilar§! and §YEborthil§!, the §YTijarikheti§! of the southern mountains, and the §YBrasanni§! of the Bulwari coast.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nRule over §YKheterata§! would eventually be granted to the Crodamos dynasty of Akan, who would maintain it even after losing Akan itself.

This left Kheterata in a state of chaos; the Crodamos dynasty no longer held the support of the Khet, the Khetarch abandoned any semblance of leadership in favor of open hedonism, and Jaher's heir, Jexis, began a conquest of Kheterata with the permission of the apathetic Khetarch.\n\nThe Sun Elf occupation ended with the death of Baqtkhet I in 1160 and of Jexis in 1162. A new alliance was established between Khetarch Baqtkhet II and the Crodamos dynasty, while the gnolls of the south began a period of expansion that reached its climax in 1442 with the conquest of the south Sorrow by Grizaka Emperor-of-Gnollkind.

However, concerned as they are with higher matters, it falls to Nahab - the greatest servant of the Khetarchy - to act in their place.\n\nBy contrast, the messianic supporters of Aahmes identify a different source of Kheterata's weakness:  the influence of foreigners, foremost among them the Damerian dogs of the House of Crodamos. Only by the full assimilation of such elements, and a return to pure §YKheteratan§! culture, can the Kingdom regain the strength that once saw it rule the entire western Salahad - and it falls to Aahmes, once a bandit before he foresaw his glorious destiny, to lead this purification.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nBorn out of frustration towards Crodamic weakness, as well as the open corruption of much of the Kheteratan upper class, the rebellion has seized much of the northern Sorrow and successfully cut Kheterat off from the coast of the Divenhal.

Instead, focus is on proper behavior and emulation of Elikhet - correct conduct, rather than faith, is emphasized in Khetism and as such rituals and taboos are the faith's primary impact on its followers - a good Khetist must not consort with the foul djinn, must not betray the recognized King, must not adopt the worship of a foreign deity, and many other such taboos, the majority of them prohibited by Elikhet himself.\n\nKhetism is organized in the same manner Elikhet's own court was; the Khetarch, standing in for Elikhet himself, is the foremost authority but one too concerned with greater matters to truly rule the faithful. Instead, the King of Kheterata protects the holy land while the High Priest guides the faithful, a division of duties tracing back to the very founding of Kheterata.
