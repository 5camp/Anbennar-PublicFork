In much recent history, however, Lorent has become known as a great adopter of elven culture and customs, falling under the guidance of the elf §YIoriel§! in 1022, the wife of then King §YRuben II§!, leading to Lorent becoming the cultural and military superpower it is today.\n\nThe country is divided into two primary cultures: §YHigh Lorentish§! (the half-elven nobility and urban human class who have fully embraced the elven ways) and the §YLow Lorentish§! (the rural backbone of the country who are still predominantly human, though more accepting of the elvenized customs than its other human counterparts elsewhere). In terms of other races, Lorent has long acted as suzerain for the §YRedfoot Halflings§! of the southern §YSmall Country§!, and maintains close relations with its ancient §YRuby Dwarf§! neighbours of §YRubyhold§!. The §YMoon Elf§! realm of the §YRedglades§! also lies under Lorentish control, a woodland sanctuary established by Ioriel herself.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe §YLilac Wars§! (1348-1443) between Lorent and Anbennar has brought the kingdom to its knees. And while Lorent did emerge victorious, destroying the §YHouse of Silmuna§! and preventing them from holding the imperial throne ever again, §YKylian VI§! now finds himself at a fragile peace at home. The war saw Lorent's most powerful vassals, the §YWine Lords§! of §YMadelaire, Eilísin,§! and §YRubenaire§!, side with the Silmuna, and despite the war's end, they have now refused to swear fealty to their rightful overlord, eroding the authority of the Lorentish crown.\n\nTo the east, Lorent has installed its ally, §YLothane, the Grand Duke of Wex§!, on the imperial throne of Anbennar. In the name of unity, Kylian has wed his sister to this new emperor, hoping to use dynastic ties to control the Empire of Anbennar from within, but only time will tell if this is a match meant to last, now that the House of Silmuna, the enemy of their enemy, is no more.\n\nTo the north, the halfling §YSmall Country§! remains calm yet divided between Lorent and its eternal rival, §YGawed§!. Peace never lasts, however, and as Lorent looks to recover from the Lilac Wars, the northern eagle of Gawed begins to look south once again like the days of §YLorenan the Great§!."

 string_start_kheterata:0 "§OPrimer§!\n§YKheterata§! holds itself as the eldest civilization in all of the world, save perhaps a few dwarven remnants sulking in their caves, with a legacy tracing back to the time when even §YCastanor§! had yet to be born. It is a land dominated by the legacy of its divine founder and his children, Elikhet and the Khet, yet always ruled by mere mortals - even Elikhet, for all his might and glory, often placed human friends on the throne of Kheterata rather than always sit upon it himself.\n\nThe blessing of the Sorrow, the magical river created by Elikhet at the height of his power and invested with much of his divine might, is the center of Kheteratan civilization - creating a bountiful, fertile heartland for the Kheteratans protected from all foes by miles upon miles of desert to the east and west. Though eventually this protection would fail in the face of gnollish and later Damerian conquests, these were always overthrown eventually and Kheterata returned to its state of splendid isolation, even if - as in the case of the Damerians - Elikhet himself had to rise from the dead to see it done.\n\nKheterata is dominated by a singular, homogenous §YKheteratan§! culture; the descendants of those tribes who followed Elikhet west to escape the grasp of the Bulwari God-Kings. Kheteratan culture is also influenced by the historical subject peoples of Kheterata, many of whom were relocated to the Sorrow; the §YDesha§! and §YKhasani§! of §YAkan§!, the §YBusinori§! of what is now §YBusilar§! and §YEborthil§!, the §YTijarikheti§! of the southern mountains, and the §YBrasanni§! of the Bulwari coast.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nRule over §YKheterata§! would eventually be granted to the Crodamos dynasty of Akan, who would maintain it even after losing Akan itself. This would change when the Sun Elf Jaher arrived in Kheterata following his conquest of Bulwar, as he would so charm the Khetarch Baqtkhet I that he mandated that Kheterata would enter an alliance with Jaher's empire and promised to crown him as King of Kheterata on the death of the human King at the time.\n\nThen the unexpected happened; the King of Kheterata outlived Jaher. This left Kheterata in a state of chaos; the Crodamos dynasty no longer held the support of the Khet, the Khetarch abandoned any semblance of leadership in favor of open hedonism, and Jaher's heir, Jexis, began a conquest of Kheterata with the permission of the apathetic Khetarch.\n\nThe Sun Elf occupation ended with the death of Baqtkhet I in 1160 and of Jexis in 1162. A new alliance was established between Khetarch Baqtkhet II and the Crodamos dynasty, while the gnolls of the south began a period of expansion that reached its climax in 1442 with the conquest of the south Sorrow by Grizaka Emperor-of-Gnollkind. Interpreted as a sign of royal weakness by many, a priestly rebellion in Nirat and the renewed Sun Elf expansionism of Elizna now threaten Crodamic rule."

Two figures lead the rebellion; §YHigh Priest Nahab the Defiant§! and §YCommander Aahmes the Dashing§!. Though they remain firm allies until the Crodamos have been toppled, already division shows its face between the ultratraditionalist priests of Nahab and the messianic soldiers of Aahmes.\n\nThe ultratraditionalist supporters of Nahab the Defiant believe that Kheterata has fallen into sin due to a failure to strictly abide by the taboos of Elikhet; only be crushing the decadent nobility and restoring power to the Khetarch, as was clearly intended, can this spiritual sickness be excised from Kheterata. However, concerned as they are with higher matters, it falls to Nahab - the greatest servant of the Khetarchy - to act in their place.\n\nBy contrast, the messianic supporters of Aahmes identify a different source of Kheterata's weakness,  the influence of foreigners, foremost among them the Damerian dogs of the House of Crodamos. Only by the full assimilation of such elements, and a return to pure §YKheteratan§! culture, can the Kingdom regain the strength that once saw it rule the entire western Salahad - and it falls to Aahmes, once a bandit before he foresaw his glorious destiny, to lead this purification.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nBorn out of frustration towards Crodamic weakness, as well as the open corruption of much of the Kheteratan upper class, the rebellion has seized much of the northern Sorrow and successfully cut Kheterat off from the coast of the Divenhal. With such a bold move crippling the already-weak Kings of the House of Crodamos, a final war for the fate of Kheterata is a certainty now and the Nirat faction believes its victory to be assured.\n\nDespite this imminent war for Kheterata's soul, other enemies also persist, the Sun Elves of §YElizna§! haunt the east, seeking to begin a second elven occupation and restore the tyranny of Jexis, while the gnollish invaders of §YViakkoc§! and §YGnollakaz§! despoil the west and south.

Though this would cost her the support of many elven supremacists and Jexisian loyalists, who would flee to Sareyand and the Jaddari Legion of Far Bulwar respectively, her popularity with the Kheteratan middle class would secure Elizna's position in that country. In 1369, her son §YOlorin Vulzinzuir§! would succeed her, and position himself as friend to Bulwari and Kheteratan alike, but some believe the time shall soon come where he must choose one or the other."

Over time, many gnomes ventured south towards the coast, forming new urban centers, which became thriving city-states.\n\nBy the 12th century BA these city-states had united to form the §YGnomish Hierarchy§!, one of the ancient empires of antiquity, alongside §YCastanor§! and the §YKingdom of Kheterata§!; between these three great powers Western Cannor was divided up, with the Gnomish Hierarchy subjugating the human and halfing tribes of the §YSmall Country§!, and laying the foundations for §YBeepeck§!.\n\nWith mercantile prowess and technological cunning, the Hierarchy assisted in the colonization of the Dameshead, helping to build both §YVertesk§! and §YDamenath§!. It supported the §YDamerian Republic§! in the §YWar of the Cerulean League§!, though that alliance would be short-lived and the Hierarchy would find itself at war with both the Republic and Castanor for dominance over Cannor at various points.\n\nBut everything changed when the kobolds attacked, pouring forth in the years of the §YDragonwake§!. In a few short years, the Hierarchy had been reduced to a single island city-state, Nimscodd, with fully half the gnomish population scattered as exiles through Cannor, and many enslaved.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nFor nearly a thousand years the gnomes have maneuvered to regain their lost lands, and are now on the cusp of a grand effort to do so.

But the kobolds in the north are not the only obstacle to be surmounted.\n\n§YLorent§! and §YGawed§!, the great powers of Cannor, stand in constant watch of each other, both eying land across the border with greed. Courting one or the other would secure the borders, but tempt the other's wrath. And beware the mercurial temperament and lifespan of the humans; Gawed's new, young, monarch already wishes to reclaim the Gnomish Pass for his own ends.\n\nTo the southwest, the settled reavers of §YReveria§! lurk, and deny the hierarchy land access to the city-state of Portnamm, home of the §YCreek Gnomes§!. Directly south of the border sits the Small Country, once colonized by the Hierarchy and now vassals of Gawed and Lorent.\n\nThe Hierarchy stands at the foot of its ancient grandness. With adroit maneuvering and the help of the §YArtificers' Gommo§!, new §Yinventions§! and clever tactics will win the day on the §YDragon Coast§!. Settlers are prepared to recolonize their homeland, and volunteers for the Reclamation Army swell. The kobolds are divided amongst themselves, for now, and the gears are already in motion for the first strike.\n\nThe time of reclamation has come!"

It is more of a loose set of related deities than a single religion with a strict and formal hierarchy, instead with mostly autonomous temples adhering to a particular patron deity.\n\nBelief is fluid and flexible, with most people paying respect to multiple gods depending on what the worshipper wants or requires - however, most worshippers are expected to have a patron deity that they adhere to above all, usually one that is most relevant to their goal and path in life.\n\nThe Regent Court is structured like a medieval court, with Castellos taking the role of King, and his wife Esmaryal as queen. The rest of the deities are either his children (such as Adean), the offspring of his deceased siblings, or beings either created during the conflicts of aeons past or those that have risen to godhood from mortal upbringings."

Elikhet is worshiped as the eternal lord of Kheterata, and though the existence of other deities is not explicitly denied they are universally considered less worthy of veneration than Elikhet - their worship is tolerated to various extents, but plays no role in orthodox Khetist doctrine or rituals.\n\nBelief in Elikhet and the Khet is considered obvious fact, rather than a matter of faith. Instead, focus is on proper behavior and emulation of Elikhet - correct conduct, rather than faith, is emphasized in Khetism and as such rituals and taboos are the faith's primary impact on its followers - a good Khetist must not consort with the foul djinn, must not betray the recognized King, must not adopt the worship of a foreign deity, and many other such taboos, the majority of them prohibited by Elikhet himself.\n\nKhetism is organized in the same manner Elikhet's own court was; the Khetarch, standing in for Elikhet himself, is the foremost authority but one too concerned with greater matters to truly rule the faithful. Instead, the King of Kheterata protects the holy land while the High Priest guides the faithful, a division of duties tracing back to the very founding of Kheterata. Outside Kheterata itself, recognized proxies perform the same duties regionally, but remain subordinate to the King and High Priest."

 string_start_eordand_description:0 "Eordand is a region of Northwestern Aelantir populated by Fey and Season worshipping Eordan Ruinborn Elves. It is centered around the Domandrod, an ancient and forbidden forest populated by the Fey, and around this axle the Eordan build civilizations like spokes on a wheel. The Druidic magic taught to the Eordan after the Day of the Ashen Skies broke the Eordan into five cultures: the Selpheregi who venerate Spring, the Caamas who venerate Summer, the Tuathak who venerate Autumn, the Snecboth who venerate Winter, and the Peitar who strive to maintain balance and heed the orders of their Fey masters. \n\nEordand is soaked in Druidic magical power from the Feyrealm's shadow over the Domandrod. The Eordan primarily dwell around the Domandrod, having left the custody of the Fey long ago, apart from the few chosen Gladewardens. Eordand is surrounded by seas in all directions except for a land connection in the southeast to the desolate Egasach desert, and to the east connected to the Ekyunimoy mountains. Of note are the Sarmadfar Sea alongside the Elarbarc gulf, the Glorelthir coastline, the Randrunnse gulf, and the Broken Sea to the far north studded with icebergs. \n\nThe Domandrod is a vast forest wilderness teeming with wildlife, Fey, and abberations. Within its borders the Feyrealm pokes into the Material Plane, causing fantastical and terrifying landscapes. Surrounding the Domandrod, Eordand is primarily composed of forests and grasslands pierced with rivers, many of which originate from the Domandrod. These surrounding lands may not be half within the Feyrealm, but it's magical influence is still strong, moreso than the effect of the Day of Ashen Skies. \n\nIn the western coast along the Glorelthir and Milsgelp coastline the Spring Court grows in eternal bloom, situated where the season of Spring is the strongest. Along the southern coastline of the Sarmadfar the Summer Court basks in the warmth of the sunn and the cool ocean waves, where the Summer is the strongest. In the far north the Winter Court ekes a living in the half-frozen taiga, where Winter strikes every year the strongest. North of the Spring Court, the Autumn Court's homeland along the Fogarabh wages eternal war and preparation against the Winter. \n\nEordand is dominated by the grand cities of Arakeprun and Murdkather, both being built on the bones of Precursor Ruins. Across Eordand Precursor ruins dot the landscape, some piercing the heavens while others are buried beneath the earth. From these ancient structures countless treasures can be found, some mundane while others containing vast knowledge and power."

They reside on the western coast of Eordand, centered around the ancient rebuilt Precursor city of Arakeprun. The Selpheregi are the most inquisitive and creative of the Eordan, being surrounded by Precursor ruins that inspire them to discover the secrets of the past. They often have a sense of superiority towards the other Eordan because of the flourishing wonders of their homeland. The season of Spring gives them a natural aptitude towards growing plantlife, as well as enabling them to grow flowering bushes on themselves.

The Snecboth maintain strong interfamiliar and interclan relations, and prefer the calmly discuss matters instead of rashly acting with violence, but do not trust and easily help outsiders who have never helped the Snecboth.

The Peitar tribes tend to work together unlike the seasonalists, often allying and working together in war. Due to upholding the balance of seasons, the Peitar are not as strikingly apparent as the rest of the Eordan: they have white to darker than skin, ginger to blond braided hair, commonly wear elaborate warpaint, often have green eyes, and dress in green and brown clothing to blend into the deep forest in both humble linen and fine silk."
