In much recent history, however, Lorent has become known as a great adopter of elven culture and customs, falling under the guidance of the elf §YIoriel§! in 1022, the wife of then King §YRuben II§!, leading to Lorent becoming the cultural and military superpower it is today.\n\nThe country is divided into two primary cultures: §YHigh Lorentish§! (the half-elven nobility and urban human class who have fully embraced the elven ways) and the §YLow Lorentish§! (the rural backbone of the country who are still predominantly human, though more accepting of the elvenized customs than its other human counterparts elsewhere). In terms of other races, Lorent has long acted as suzerain for the §YRedfoot Halflings§! of the southern §YSmall Country§!, and maintains close relations with its ancient §YRuby Dwarf§! neighbours of §YRubyhold§!. The §YMoon Elf§! realm of the §YRedglades§! also lies under Lorentish control, a woodland sanctuary established by Ioriel herself.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe §YLilac Wars§! (1348-1443) between Lorent and Anbennar has brought the kingdom to its knees. And while Lorent did emerge victorious, destroying the §YHouse of Silmuna§! and preventing them from holding the imperial throne ever again, §YKylian VI§! now finds himself at a fragile peace at home. The war saw Lorent's most powerful vassals, the §YWine Lords§! of §YMadelaire, Eilísin,§! and §YRubenaire§!, side with the Silmuna, and despite the war's end, they have now refused to swear fealty to their rightful overlord, eroding the authority of the Lorentish crown.\n\nTo the east, Lorent has installed its ally, §YLothane, the Grand Duke of Wex§!, on the imperial throne of Anbennar. In the name of unity, Kylian has wed his sister to this new emperor, hoping to use dynastic ties to control the Empire of Anbennar from within, but only time will tell if this is a match meant to last, now that the House of Silmuna, the enemy of their enemy, is no more.\n\nTo the north, the halfling §YSmall Country§! remains calm yet divided between Lorent and its eternal rival, §YGawed§!. Peace never lasts, however, and as Lorent looks to recover from the Lilac Wars, the northern eagle of Gawed begins to look south once again like the days of §YLorenan the Great§!."

 string_start_kwineh_description:0 "§OPrimer§!\nWhen the first Cannorian vessels reached the Eastern coast of §YNoruin§!, they were confronted with a vast crimson-leaved forest that seemed to stretch unbroken for hundreds of miles down the coastline. A keen-eyed lookout noticed strange figures moving through the woods as the ship made its way down the shore, and a small party was selected to go ashore to investigate. Our explorers were soon met by native emissaries – a group of pale-skinned, rosy-cheeked beings that called themselves the §YKwineh§!.\n\nSurmised to be descended from elven survivors of the §YDay of Ashen Skies§!, the Kwineh people share the same general body plan, sharply pointed ears, and willowy build of moon elves, but differ in the shape of their nose, the bridge of which swings upward sharply and exposes the nostrils, giving the Kwineh face a §Ybatlike§! appearance. They dress mostly in hides or furs and tattoo the skin of their warrior elite and honored elders with pigments derived from the crimson sap of the trees that give these lands, the §YBloodgroves§!, their name.\n\nMost of the Kwineh live in semi-permanent settlements along the §YSella§! river, practicing low-intensity agriculture of crops such as maize, squash, and tobacco. Councils of elders elect chiefs from within their ranks to deal with diplomatic and military matters while most day-to-day political affairs are handled by the council. Skilled craftsmen, the Kwineh work iron into tools and weapons, fashion garnet jewelry, and carry on an extensive trade of these and other goods with their western neighbors, the §YBoek§!, with whom they coexist mostly peacefully. The Kwineh keep perpetual watch on these trade missions, however – not for the Boek, but for the monstrous §YBloodfeeders§!, degenerated creatures that may once have been elves but are now little more than beasts, hunting like packs of wolves and drinking equally from the sap of §YBloodgrove§! trees and the veins of whatever living creature they lay their claws upon.\n\nIt is the relationship between the Kwineh and the forest lands they call home that most defines their religious beliefs. Kwineh religion centers around the worship of §YThe Weeping Mother§!, a deific personification of the Bloodgroves, and they believe that the forest itself is a sacred being to be honored and protected – the bloody color of the tree’s sap and leaves during autumn and winter is thought to be the blood of the countless individuals who perished in §Y“The Great Dying”§! millennia ago, for whom the Forest Mother still mourns. Despite her eternal mourning, she nourishes those who respect her beneficence but will withhold the bounty of nature from the disrespectful – thus the Kwineh are very particular about consumption of natural resources, taking no more than needed and offering thanks to the Weeping Mother for each gift she imparts."
 
 string_start_boek_description:0 "§OPrimer§!\nWest of the crimson-leaved §YBloodgroves§!, the coastline of §YAelantir§! sweeps sharply inwards to an enormous estuarine bay teeming with fish and ringed with saltmarshes. Here the vast §YYnn§! river pours millions of gallons of freshwater into the §YRuined Sea§!, creating one of the richest marine ecosystems in the world. Early maps of the coastline revealed that the region has the rough appearance of a troll’s head, and Cannorian adventurers have come to call the place §Y“Trollsbay”§!, but the people who live on these shores are not trolls – they are the fearless warriors of the §YBoek§! clans.\n\nThe Boek are similar in appearance to the other Ruinborn found along the shore of the Ruined Sea, though the telltale bat-like nose is less prominent among their people. They are stockier than the §YKwineh§! or §YCheshoshi§! - shorter, but with strong jawlines and prominent features found more often in humans than the gracile elves. Their skin is a tanned brownish-red that they adorn with tattoos and accent with rings, bracelets, and earrings of precious metals (though where they acquire this jewelry is a §Ymystery§!, as they do not seem to have the expertise to craft the intricate pieces themselves). The Boek clothe themselves in woven fabrics made from native plants and braid their hair into intricate weaves that detail the principal achievements of their lives.\n\nThe Boek are first and foremost a society of warriors. Organized into competing tribes, each individual Boek clan is led by a council of its foremost warriors. Membership in a Boek ruling council is entirely by merit, and those who are too old to fight for their position lose it when unable to contest a challenge to their leadership. Conflict between the clans is common - they regularly fight low intensity wars to determine territory and suzerainty over lesser tribes, though these wars are largely ceremonial and feature relatively little bloodshed. Most every boy and girl among the Boek strives to be a §YBrave§!, training regularly in athletic games that prepare them for battle against each other and the hostile Cheshoshi to the south. When not warring, the Boek fish, hunt, cultivate small plots of land, and carry-on extensive trade with the Kwineh, bartering woven cloth, spices, and coffee for the Kwineh’s jewelry and expertly worked iron tools and weapons.\n\nBoek mythology begins with a great flood that rose and drowned all things in the world including the gods. Only three groups were left alive: those who §Yfled by ship§!, those who §Yclimbed the highest mountains§!, and those who §Ysheltered underground§!. The Boek believe themselves descended from this third group and are still wary of the waters that once engulfed the world – to this day they do not venture beyond the sight of the shore in their canoes. They believe that those who climbed the mountains still live far above the Cliffs, while those who sailed away will one day return from across the sea."
 
 string_start_cheshoshi_description:0 "§OPrimer§!\nThe first explorers to reach the §YReaper’s Coast§! quickly discovered that going ashore was a dangerous proposition, for the shores of the western sea of ruin are neither as empty nor unguarded as they first appear. These are the lands of the §YCheshoshi§!, a hostile group of natives with no patience for interlopers and no interest in peace.\n\nThe Cheshoshi are striking in their appearance. Like many ruinborn elves their noses are batlike, and they are fond of body tattoos – but while the §YKwineh§! use bloodsap to accentuate themselves in reds, the Cheshoshi paint the entirety of their bodies in darkest black. This coloration aids them as camouflage during the night raids they are so fond of but also serves to accentuate the many scars that Cheshoshi warriors bear. Some of the thin white lines that crisscross the bodies of the Cheshoshi are battle scars, but most are self-inflicted – ritualistic scars flow around and accent those received at war, a dizzying array of shapes and designs. Some surmise that these ritual scars tell a story, though the Cheshoshi have themselves not revealed the purpose of their scarification.\n\nThe Cheshoshi are almost universally aggressive and violent, and settlements along the Reaper’s Coast keep a constant vigil against Cheshoshi raids lest their colonists be killed or captured and dragged off towards a grisly fate. Their unwelcoming attitude towards us is not unique – the §YBoek§! tribes to the north have been the subject of raids by the Cheshoshi for many years, and many Boek guides refuse to lead expeditions into the dangerous and supposedly cursed lands of the Cheshoshi.\n\nGiven their attitude towards peaceful coexistence and trade relations, little is known about the inner workings of Cheshoshi society. Their settlements are often raised into the trees and are well fortified. They can work iron and craft wicked blades and strong tools of the material – conversely, they do not seem to have much use for precious metals or ornamentation beyond their scars. Their religion is likewise a mystery - they are known to worship and draw their name from a being they call §YCheshosh§!, a wrathful deity that §Ydestroyed the continent§! in ages past. Across Cheshoshi territory, small cairns of stone and bone are found, skulls are carved into trees, and bone chimes clatter ominously in the wind – all seemingly icons of worship of this Ruinborn death god."

In this stinking and fetid fen lurk the §YLeechmen§!, remorseless amphibian predators whose semblance of society is defined by a cruel and casual disregard for the lives of those around them.\n\nThe name “Leechman” is a misnomer, as these monstrous creatures are descended from survivors of the §YDay of Ashen Skies§!, barely recognizable as having once been §Yelves§! though they might be. They are possessed of oily black skin, double-lidded eyes, and gills that allow them to lurk unseen in the turbid waters of their homeland. Expert ambushers, any animals that wander too close to their hiding places quickly fall victim to the horribly betoothed maws of these hematophagous horrors.\n\nThough their nightmarish mouths render them §Yunable to speak in any intelligible language§!, the Leechmen are intelligent and possess a surprising level of sophistication. Each tribe is governed by the joint rule of a warchief and high shaman who direct the construction of small, sturdy villages and lead raids against nearby tribes. Leechmen communicate with each other via a complicated sign language and keep surprisingly detailed written records of every important event for each tribe dating back to its inception. While these records are primarily concerned with the methods and histories of hunting and consuming various marine and land-dwelling organisms, such activities prove the leechmen to be more than just mere beasts – a fact that provides little comfort to those unfortunate souls that fall victim to their ever-hungry mouths.\n\nNot all of the victims captured by the leechmen are devoured, though their fates are just as grisly. The Leechmen’s religion warns of an entity known as the §YLeechfather§! that lurks at the edge of waking somewhere beneath the waters of the Dens. Were he ever to awaken, the Leechfather would §Ydevour the whole of the world§! and leave only a §Ydesiccated husk§! behind, but his sleep can be maintained with a constant flow of blood into the swamp. To keep the Leechfather dreaming his foul dreams, the Leechmen ritualistically sacrifice captured Effelai and Leechmen from other tribes, cutting their throats and draining their vital ichor into the swamp to preserve the world for another day."
