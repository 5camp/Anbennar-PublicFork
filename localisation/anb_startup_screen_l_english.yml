 string_start_cannor_description:0 "Cannor is a diverse temperate land inhabited by many races such as halflings, dwarves, gnomes, kobolds and orcs, though the dominant race of the continent is humanity in addition to its half-elven nobility: the scions of 400-year old pairings between elven migrants and the native human nobility.\n\nAt the center of Cannor lies the §YDameshead§!, an inland sea surrounded primarily by the §YEmpire of Anbennar§!, a giant, but largely divided, Empire that dominates the central regions of Cannor. Upon the death of an §YEmperor§! the §YImperial Electors§! select his replacement by voting. A member can become an Elector by being granted an Electorate by the current Emperor or inheriting an Elector.\n\nCountries within Anbennar (meaning 'Unity' in Elven) are allowed their own diplomacy and can even have their own subjects, but the Emperor is obligated to defend them from outside forces and can demand that they hand back §YUnlawfully Acquired Territory§! within the Empire.\n\nWhile the §YAuthority§! of the Emperor is currently low, this may change if the Emperor can strengthen his hold through §YImperial Reforms§!.\n\n[Root.start_imperial_cities_description]\n\n[Root.start_tributaries_descriptions]"

 string_start_lorent:0 "§g\"On my honour, I swear eternal love and allegiance to the Rose, the King, and to the Four Virtues of Lady Ioriel."\n-Final verse of the Lorentish Knight's Vow§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nLorent has sat as the rightful sovereign of Western Cannor (known as §YLencenor§!) since long before the arrival of the elves in 1000 AA.\nIt is a country famed for its etiquette, bountiful vineyards and romantic tales of chivalry, but also as one of the §YGreat Powers of Cannor§!, competing with §YGawed§! to the north and the §YEmpire of Anbennar§! to the east for dominion over the continent of §YCannor§!.\n\nThe kingdom owes its inception and name to §YLorenan the Great§!, an ancient human king who famously defeated the invading §YAlenic§! ancestors of its now-rival §YGawed§! during the chaos of the §YDragonwake§! in 470. In much recent history, however, Lorent has become known as a great adopter of elven culture and customs, falling under the guidance of the elf §YIoriel§! in 1022, the wife of then King §YRuben II§!, leading to Lorent becoming the cultural and military superpower it is today.\n\nThe country is divided into two primary cultures: §YHigh Lorentish§! (the half-elven nobility and urban human class who have fully embraced the elven ways) and the §YLow Lorentish§! (the rural backbone of the country who are still predominantly human, though more accepting of the elvenized customs than its other human counterparts elsewhere). In terms of other races, Lorent has long acted as suzerain for the §YRedfoot Halflings§! of the southern §YSmall Country§!, and maintains close relations with its ancient §YRuby Dwarf§! neighbours of §YRubyhold§!. The §YMoon Elf§! realm of the §YRedglades§! also lies under Lorentish control, a woodland sanctuary established by Ioriel herself.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe §YLilac Wars§! (1348-1443) between Lorent and Anbennar has brought the kingdom to its knees. And while Lorent did emerge victorious, destroying the §YHouse of Silmuna§! and preventing them from holding the imperial throne ever again, §YKylian VI§! now finds himself at a fragile peace at home. The war saw Lorent's most powerful vassals, the §YWine Lords of Madelaire, Eilísin, and Rubenaire§! side with the Silmuna, and despite the war's end, have refused to swear fealty to their rightful overlord, eroding the authority of the Lorentish crown.\n\nTo the east, Lorent has installed its ally, §YLothane, the Grand Duke of Wex§!, on the imperial throne of Anbennar. In the name of unity, Kylian has wed his sister to this new emperor, hoping to use dynastic ties to control the Empire of Anbennar from within, but only time will tell if this is a match meant to last, now that the House of Silmuna, the enemy of their enemy, is no more.\n\nTo the north, the halfling §YSmall Country§! remains calm yet divided between Lorent and its eternal rival, §YGawed§!. Peace never lasts, however, and as Lorent looks to recover from the Lilac Wars, the northern eagle of Gawed begins to look south once again like the days of §YLorenan the Great§!."

However this recently changed in the 'Decades of Devastation' where the local elven kingdoms where ravaged by famines, war, human rebellions and goblin invasions.\n\nCurrently the region is divides the remnants of the §Yelvish kingdoms§!, states found by §Yhuman rebels§! and §Ygoblin clans§! who fled here thanks to Dookanson's aggression.\n\nIn the west the most powerful forces are §YRe'uyel§! (originally an elven kingdom before it got taken over by half-human nobles), the mercantile dwarven hold of §YOvdal Tûngr§! and the §YCrathanori§! (the descendants of settlers from Businor).\n\nIn the east the most powerful entity is the §YAqatbar Overclan§! (which combines goblin militarism with a bureaucracy of half-elf collaborators and wide use of human mercenaries or 'liberated' slaves as soldiers to create a veritable military-administrative complex), though the elven kingdom of §YBirsartanšes§! and the human rebels who name themselves the §YDartaxâgerdim§!, after their leader Dartaxes, are close contenders."

However, that greatness faded after the Day of Ashen Skies, and for centuries all that remained were bickering feudal kingdoms, weakened enough to allow §YCastan Ebonfrost§! to reunify the empire in his own image when he founded the dreaded Black Castanor.\n\nIt only became darker when the 52nd Castan was made a puppet by the §YSorceror-King Nichmer§!, who then led Black Castanor in brutal wars until most of Cannor fell under his dominion. It would take the continent-spanning §YWar of the Sorceror King§!, and the arrival of §YElves§! talented in sword and magic, to bring him down.\n\nAfter Nichmer's death at the §YBattle of Trialmount§!, Castanor fractured and Escann entered its chivalric period. Kingdoms like §YCastellyr§!, §YFarranean§!, and §YAdenica§!, became lands of legend — wars were rare and conflicts were instead handled by knightly duels and jousting tournaments.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nPerhaps this practice made the region weak, as the land crumbled when the §YGreentide§! came after the fall of Khugdihr in 1424. Orcs, united by §YKorgus Dookanson§!, rushed out of the Serpentspine in their millions. Castellyr was first to fall, its white walls worthless against this threat from a new direction.

It is more of a loose set of related deities than a single religion with a strict and formal hierarchy, instead with mostly autonomous temples adhering to a particular patron deity.\n\nBelief is fluid and flexible, with most people paying respect to multiple gods depending on what the worshipper wants or requires - however, most worshippers are expected to have a patron deity that they adhere to above all, usually one that is most relevant to their goal and path in life.\n\nThe Regent Court is structured like a medieval court, with Castellos taking the role of King, and his wife Esmaryal as queen. The rest of the deities are either his children (such as Adean), the offspring of his deceased siblings, or beings either created during the conflicts of aeons past or those that have risen to godhood from mortal upbringings."
