 flavour_velsfadhecai.1.t:0 "The Whale Of The West"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.1.d:0 "At the dawn of the days of eld, Lord Celadil Konyrzab ruled over Vels Fadhecai. To his admirers, he was a reasonable leader, unafraid to seek help from his advisors whenever he needed it. To his detractors, he was reliant on the support of the nobility, granting them more and more power in exchange for their loyalty and invites to their lavish gatherings.\n\nNone, however, could deny his beauty.\n\nWomen adored his candour and charm. Men found themselves entranced by his suppleness and femininity. Celadil appreciated them all, gleefully filling the realm with passion, whimsy, and children of questionable parentage. The nobility were all too eager to act in kind, calling upon an archaic law in order to claim a night with any newlywed that caught their fancy.\n\nBorn though he was during the Dragon Stuir Balia, those who view his reign less-than-fondly enjoy using a certain moniker when referring to their Lord; "Epadposkawa". The Whale Of The West.\n\nLord Celadil was loved, that much was certain. But these were the days of eld; they are remembered for what came after..."
 flavour_velsfadhecai.1.a:0 "She shared his hair, and his mouth, and his eyes. But she was destined to be greater."
 vf_wotw_tt:0 "The Nobility begin with the §YCommand Over The Military§! and the §YRight Of The First Night§! privileges enacted."

 flavour_velsfadhecai.2.t:0 "Twilit Auditions"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.2.d:0 "My mother was strict, and moody, and never suffered inadequacy. As such, she was a brilliant teacher.\n\nShe rarely spoke of her life before she came to Vels Fadhecai. I knew she had been a Riverblade, spending years training in Vels Bacar, where she had been born. I knew she had sworn herself to a Bosancovaco noble, or maybe a priest, or maybe a merchant. I knew she had fallen pregnant, breaking the stringent oath he had had her take, and she had been exiled for it. I knew she had arrived here, in this land of exiles, and never saw fit to leave.\n\nOne of Lord Celadil's advisors sought her out, asking her to teach the new generation. "Wars are on the horizon, Nathasadra" he had said, prostrating himself on our front doorstep, "and you must help us win them." She accepted, because why wouldn't she?\n\nI attended her training sessions sometimes. Even then, at the age of 10, I wasn't the youngest there. Every time, the same people would capture my attention: one of the instructors, with his disarming smirk, his thin, pointed blade, and how he seemed to dance as he fought; the man who had come for my mother, watching over the proceedings with a twinkling eye, occassionally distracted by someone whispering into his ear before slipping away into the trees; and a girl my age, with Fedhecan purple hair and a knack with the water magic my mother dutifully taught her, who would travel deeper into the trees at the end of the session instead of following the rest of us back home.\n\n"Varynna, sweetling," my mother once asked, as the girl disappeared off the path one evening, like she always did, "Could you help me with something?" She had never asked me for much, beyond the chores I did around the house, and her uncharacteristically-thoughtful gaze surprised me.\n\n"Anything, mama."\n\n"That girl, I believe, is lonely. While we all return home for supper, she stays out here. Practising, probably." Her frown shifted, turning wistful."

 flavour_velsfadhecai.3.t:0 "A Feast For Vultures"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.3.d:0 "Mitrenya and I watched as the Fadhecan envoy marched through the parted crowds, clad in purple robes, a sealed envelope heavy in her hands. The streets of Vels Bacar were completely silent, unwilling to earn the ire of the army that watched them.\n\nIt was an old joke. One based in truth, as all the best are. A messenger who journeys to Fadhevych, then Vels Domfan, then Vels Bacar, before finally arriving at Vels Fadhecai—their actual destination all along. For once, though, this letter's address was entirely obvious.\n\nIt must have felt incredible for Galyvlai, I realised later. His shadow war, years in the making, had borne the sweetest kind of fruit. With this, Vels Fadhecai would no longer be just the forest beyond the river.\n\nFinally, we had crossed it."

 flavour_velsfadhecai.4.t:0 "Travelling At Night"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.4.d:0 "Mitrenya always told me not to follow her, but I never listened. When I stared at the claws jutting from her lower back, I found myself glad I hadn't.\n\nAt least, I realised distantly, she wouldn't die here alone.\n\nI met the gaze of the beast. It was ghoulishly thin, with grey, sallow cheeks half-covered by its mask, which was carved from a deer's skull. Mitrenya had clearly managed to wound it, littering it with cuts and slicing one of its antlers from its root with razor-sharp blades of water, but it still managed to best her.\n\nThe wendigo advanced. Each step brought with it a memory. Holding hands with my mother as we walked the riverbank. My tutor's gentle voice as he taught me to read. Sharing a candy with Mitrenya, enjoying the rare, breathtaking smile on her face. It drew closer. The air felt thicker. A strange calm washed over me, as new memories—ones I didn't recognise—started to flicker by. An ornate crown on my closest friend's head. A river, murky red instead of clear blue. A legion of men and women, wielding weapons I'd never seen, charging into a snow-covered forest. A pale, outstretched hand in a bustling ballroom, and a voice I knew, but couldn't put to a face.\n\n"Shall we dance, dear?"\n\nJust as I could feel the monster's rancid breath on my face, a crimson spear tore through its chest. A second followed, then a third, straight through its shoulder and its stomach. It howled, the sound echoing bonechillingly through the forest, before it streaked off into the trees, its cries fading away. Behind where it had stood was Mitrenya, already forming another spear out of the blood that poured from her stomach.\n\n"I... I didn't know I could do..." She muttered, tipping forward. I rushed to catch her, heedless of the ichor that spilled over me. Her spear lost its shape, joining the rapidly-growing pool around us.\n\n"It's okay, Ren." I whispered to her unconscious form, as voices made themselves known not far from our clearing, alerted by the battle and the yowling. "It's okay now."" 
 flavour_velsfadhecai.4.a:0 "Thus, the pages began to turn..."
 vf_polerenikbonus_tt:0 "Whilst the Polerenik serve our nation, wendigos will be less likely to attack and easier to clear out."
 flavour_velsfadhecai.5.t:0 "A Lord In Purple"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.5.d:0 "Lord Celadil paid for the barge himself.\n\nIt was a beautiful thing, drapped in purple fabrics and bejeweled with glittering gems. Far too pretty for a man who had been stabbed to death in a brothel. His detractors claimed it was the best thing he had ever offered the Fadhecan people. His supporters were weeping too much to respond.\n\nBefore the barge had even been released down the river, there was talk about his succession. Celadil had far too many children for one to be obvious, and he had never openly named one as his heir; not one that had been accepted, anyway. As such, the nobility took it upon themselves.\n\nThe Purple Council, they called it. It was passably competent with the day-to-day affairs Vels Fadhecai dealt with, but everybody knew it couldn't last forever—the other estates would never stand for it, let alone the public. The Council would pick an heir from the many options they had, the other estates would approve them, and they would be tutored and crowned, all in less than half a decade.\n\nI was sceptical, but Mitrenya was... eager. She wanted to rule. She wanted something to strive for. She wanted the resources the throne could offer her.\n\nAnd, well, of course I would help, however I could. I would follow her to the edge of the Ynn if she asked, and throw myself from the cliffs in her wake."
 flavour_velsfadhecai.5.a:0 "Onwards to dawn, my dear Lady."
 vf_purplecouncil_tt:0 "§PThe Purple Council§! has convened, and will rule the nation until §GCeladil's heir§! can be chosen!"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.6.t:0 "The Gloaming"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.6.d:0 "Mitrenya was the spare.\n\nThe Purple Council had met, and talked, and talked again, and then voted. They were awed by Mitrenya's display of magical prowess, and of the techniques taught to her by the legenday Nathasadra Latekyr. They adored her manners and demeanour—"Fitting of a true Lady," one of them had proclaimed. I had to quash my pride in front of them; I was the one, after all, who spent hours pouring over my mother's books, learning all I could of what it meant to wear the crown before relaying it back to my dearest friend. Some of the nobles even had to step out and dry their eyes, her appearance enough to vividly remind them of their beloved late-Lord.\n\nBut Mitrenya, after the wendigo, would never be with child. As perfect as she was, the succession simply wouldn't be safe, even if she chose to adopt. And the Purple Council existed to secure the succession.\n\nWhile we stood at the sidelines, they brought Ariadne forward. She was beautiful. Radiant. As charming as her father, and then some. She had little in the way of magic, but her glory more than made up for it. I spoke with her once, to congratulate her, and if it weren't for the circumstances I too would have been charmed by her honeyed words and delicate smile.\n\n"There's still a chance, Ren." I said as we walked home, our elbows linked. 'She might decide not to take it, or she might-'\n\n"It's fine, Varynna." Mitrenya responded, though her tone suggested it was anything but. "It's okay. I'll figure something out.""

 vf_ariadnefound_tt:0 "When she is ready to rule, the §PPurple Council§! will dissolve and §BAriadne Konyrzab§! will take the throne!"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.7.t:0 "Destiny"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.7.d:0 "Ariadne's coronation was like something out of a storybook. Long, draping silks decked the halls of the castle. The throne room was packed full, as palace guards kept us all in orderly groups. Everybody who was anybody attended; blacksmiths, mages, farmers, merchants, priests, nobles... and Mitrenya and I. Though she was, technically, the heir, we were still placed with the rest of the public, most of whom weren't even aware of her position. They only had eyes for Ariadne.\n\nAnd who could blame then? The girl was a vision to a behold, dressed in finery so masterfully crafted it put the rest of the hall to shame. Her hair—purple, of course, though a shade lighter than Mitrenya's—was tied in an impossibly elaborate braid, dropping to her lower back. Vines had been weaved through it, likely cut fresh from the palace gardens.\n\nAs the ceremony continued, I found my gaze drifting, as it often did, to my dear friend. She hadn't looked at the new Lady once. Instead, she appeared to be scrutinising one of the huge windows; the one facing the Ynn, her glory clearly visible despite the distance and the forest canopy. Her eyes were misty, and far away.\n\n"You okay, Ren?" I whispered, nudging her. She jumped, before turning to face me. For the first time in weeks, she smiled, even as the crown was finally placed on Ariadne's head.\n\n"Of course, Varynna. Everything's fine.""

 vf_ariadneominous_tt:0 "§gIn a different place, or at a different time... perhaps she would have been more. Perhaps she would have been remembered.§!"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.8.t:0 "Until Dawn"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.8.d:0 "She was cold when they found her.\n\nI remember the whispers around the town that day. Lady Ariadne had been found unresponsive in her chambers, dressed in her bedclothes and tucked under her covers. The door and window had been locked, and none of the palace guards had seen anything strange. The food tasters were entirely unharmed, as was the Lady herself. Her heart had simply stopped beating.\n\nI hadn't seen Mitrenya since that morning, when a harried group of nobles had arrived and whisked her away. She had been... off. Not in a bad way. Just distracted, constantly glancing out the window as she made us breakfast. "Nothing at all, Varynna." She had said, smiling, when I asked her what was wrong.\n\nIt dawned on me, then. While Ariadne was being groomed to rule, Mitrenya had been training her magic. I had wondered why she'd stopped coming home covered in cuts that never seemed to scar, but she just waved me off. "Blood doesn't need to be a spear to be a weapon."\n\nFor a moment, I paused, my mind racing, before I started to pack. We wouldn't be living here for much longer."
 flavour_velsfadhecai.8.a:0 "To the edge of the Ynn, my dear lady, and over the cliffs too."
 flavour_velsfadhecai.9.t:0 "Twilight Sonata"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.9.d:0 "With me handling the foreign nobility, Mitrenya turned to the home front. She had taken to ruling like a duck to water. The mages, obviously, adored her. The adventurers appreciated her skills, and her past. The merchants were slowly being convinced, though the priests remained somewhat hesitant to throw their support behind her.\n\nThe issue lay, as it often did, at the feet of the nobiles.\n\nSome had supported her, of course—her ardent supporters on the Purple Council, especially—but many downright refused to work with her. Her declaration to be better than her father had ruffled a fair few feathers. Younger nobles, and those with strong proclivities for magic, were easy to bring around, but the rest were proving to be about as stubborn as a bloodstain.\n\nUnluckily for them, my dear Lady was always willing to get her hands dirty.\n\nFor a month, funerary barges were the highest-selling luxury in Vels Fadhecai. Many of the older nobles, it seemed, had suffered from a particularly dangerous coughing sickness. "Water in the lungs," their doctors had said, with apologetic frowns and bowed heads, "there's nothing to be done".\n\nThose that were left found themselves suddenly lacking allies. At that point, convincing them was as simple as reminding them of that fact."

 flavour_velsfadhecai.10.t:0 "The Proclamation At Farside"
 flavour_velsfadhecai.10.d:0 ""I am honoured, truly honoured, to be standing here today." The stage was set; a simple wooden platform, built on the riverbank. On the other side, the citizens of Velenynn went about their day, entirely ignorant of the declaration being made just across the Ynn.\n\n"We have long been a Lordship at the edge of the empire. We have been ignored. Underestimated. And we have surprised the rest of the Ynn, because of your bravery. Because of your spirit." A huge crowd had gathered to listen to their Lady. I was at the forefront, of course, and occassionally Mitrenya's eyes would meet mine.\n\n"We Fadhecans have proven that we are capable of more than anyone thought. All of Sarda lies within our reach." She paused, ever the dramatic, and the crowd appeared to draw a collective breath.\n\n"I intend to take it."\n\n"Why?" I asked her that night, lying next to her in her bedchambers. "You never struck me as the glory-hunting type, Ren." She giggled at the comment, turning to face me.\n\n"I'm not, Varynna, you know that. But after Sarda comes Dolindha. And in Dolindha... Vers Lisie."\n\n"The academy? What about it?" Her gaze became piercing, but not unfriendly. If anything, she seemed wholly determined.\n\n"Magic, Varynna. The northern forests, the owlbeasts, the everlasting flames, and the wendigos." She waved away my concerned look. "Not because of that. Just... do you remember what your mother said?"\n\n"Which part?"\n\n"That everything dies, after enough time." I nodded, hesitant. "Well, those fires don't. Neither do the trees." Her tone darkened. "Neither do the wendigos.""

She, at least, could share with me. We stood at either side of the bed, clutching one of my mother's hands each. Her eyes were closed, but she still breathed, still whispered gentle reassurances as we fought to keep from breaking down.\n\n"...I don't know what to do, mama," I choked out, gripping the hand ever so harder.\n\n"What do you mean, sweetling?" Her voice was soft, and calm. Completely unlike her.\n\n"When you're gone, I won't- I don't want to-" The tears came, then, flooding down my cheeks. Distantly, I heard Mitrenya smother a sob of her own.\n\n"Oh, Varynna. Everything dies. It's just what happens after enough time. Not even the empire could outlast it." She paused, opening her eyes to look between myself and Mitrenya. "And I had you both, didn't I? I lived, and I loved, and I was loved. I'll die, but I'll still have loved, and I'll still be loved. Isn't that just the same as living?"\n\n"But you won't be here!" Mitrenya yelled, startling the room. My gaze caught hers, and I reeled back, shocked at the fear I saw—at the desperation. "You'll be gone, and we'll be on our own, and it won't matter that we loved you because you-" She cut herself off with an anguished cry.\n\n"Of course it matters, little wolf. You both are proof that it does." Mother rasped, her voice beginning to fail her. We tried to quiet ourselves. "The sun will still rise, and the Ynn will still flow, and you'll still live, and remember me, and so I'll still live, too. And you won't be alone, even after I've gone, cub." She smiled, closing her eyes again. "You'll have Varynna, and she'll have you."\n\nIn Vels Fadhecai, two girls watched a wooden barge begin its journey down the river, joined by an aged spymaster and a man with a needlepoint blade. It crossed into the Niz Velsynn, past Stenurynn and Selocshana and Vels Domfan, before the priests at Adbrabhovi allowed it to tumble down the Divine Waterfall."
