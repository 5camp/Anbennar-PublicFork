 flavor_esmari.7.t:0 "Party destroys capital"
 flavor_esmari.7.d:0 "Drunken sailors aren't a good crew for river boats apparently. The various boats crashed ashore, demolishing the harbor."
 flavor_esmari.7.a:0 "Oh Esmaryal, what was that?"
 flavor_esmari.8.t:0 "Heroic Ruler"
 flavor_esmari.8.d:0 "Disaster was imminent. The boats were reaching the harbor at great speed. But then, $MONARCH$ realized what was happening and was able to manuever the ship and wake up the other crews, preventing a crash in the harbor.

 flavor_esmari.10.t:0 "Fight at party"
 flavor_esmari.10.d:0 "Alcohol does not make humans reasonable, and this came to the detriment of our relation with one of our neighbours. The details aren't clear as to what happened, but what is certain is that they now resent us."

 flavor_esmari.11.t:0 "Outrage at party"
 flavor_esmari.11.d:0 "The next morning, some of our soldiers woke up with pools of blood next to them, meanwhile other soldiers did not. The details are unclear, but the fact remains that one of our neighbours is going to be upset."

 flavor_esmari.12.t:0 "Good Company"
 flavor_esmari.12.d:0 "The main reason why people attend these parties is for having a distraction from work and other unpleasant or fatiguing things. Many friendships are made on these boats, just like the one between several of our officials and those of our neighbour."

 flavor_esmari.13.t:0 "A friendship"
 flavor_esmari.13.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has, between drinks and women, developed a strong friendship with the neighbouring ruler"

 flavor_esmari.14.t:0 "Influx of visitors"
 flavor_esmari.14.d:0 "When a boat party is held, many can have a preference on which party they enjoyed the most. This time, it appears that our harbors have attracted a great amount of visitors, thus resulting in the innkeepers making a fortune."
 flavor_esmari.14.a:0 "But will there be enough booze for me?"
 flavor_esmari.15.t:0 "Great influx of visitors"

 flavor_esmari.17.a:0 "Cheers!"
 flavor_esmari.18.t:0 "Vassals annoyed at boat party"
 flavor_esmari.18.d:0 "Maybe it was the fact that the liquer was of poor quality. Maybe it was the fistfight. Or the fact that many vomited on the vassals. They did not like the party either way."
 flavor_esmari.18.a:0 "Whoops"
 flavor_esmari.19.t:0 "Vassals really like boat parties"
 flavor_esmari.19.d:0 "For some, boat parties are too extreme for foreigners. But our non-Esmari vassals actually did enjoy the boat party, strengthening the bond between us."
 flavor_esmari.19.a:0 "Cheers!" 
 flavor_esmari.20.t:0 "Vassals don't like boat parties"

 flavor_esmari.21.t:0 "Experienced craftsmen at party"

 flavor_esmari.22.t:0 "Traders encounter"
 flavor_esmari.22.d:0 "Apparently, meeting in their guildhall and markets wasn't enough for the traders of the region, so they met up on the boats to scheme again. Luckily, it will be to our benefit as well."

 flavor_esmari.23.t:0 "Sparring on the boat"
 flavor_esmari.23.d:0 "Several Master at Arms have come to our feast, organizing some friendly sparring between them and our soldiers, resulting in some bruises and more experience for our soldiers."

 flavor_esmari.24.t:0 "A conversation between bureaucrats"
 flavor_esmari.24.d:0 "Several of our court officials started talking with foreign ones about admnistrative subjects at the feast, resulting in our administrators learning quite a few tricks... and several headaches between the crowd."

 flavor_esmari.25.a:0 "Glad to have hired them"
 flavor_esmari.26.t:0 "River pirate nest destroyed"

 flavor_esmari.26.a:0 "I wish they could have left me one"
 flavor_esmari.27.t:0 "A tactician on board"
 flavor_esmari.27.d:0 "Many soldiers spar on board, and many officers speak of tactics between themselves. It wasn't hard to notice one of them of particular brilliance."
 flavor_esmari.27.a:0 "Hum, EXCUSE ME!"
 flavor_esmari.28.t:0 "A military genius"
 flavor_esmari.28.d:0 "For some reason, some officer brought on board a chessboard. Many just passed by him, prefering beer, but some, especially our officers and generals, accepted his challenge. You observe as he defeats them one by one, with absolute ease. There is no doubt, he is of superior quality!"
 flavor_esmari.28.a:0 "Will you accept to serve?"
 flavor_esmari.29.t:0 "The Captain of the boat"
 flavor_esmari.29.d:0 "It's hard to miss how closely the boat nearly misses shallows and rocks. The one commanding the ship must be of rare quality."
 flavor_esmari.29.a:0 "Where is the captain?"
 flavor_esmari.30.t:0 "A renowned seafarer"
 flavor_esmari.30.d:0 "You notice a huge crowd has formed. A man is at the center of it, telling stories of faraway lands. As several sailors confirm, he must be one of the greatest wayfarers in the world."
 flavor_esmari.30.a:0 "Would you mind to stay here?"
 flavor_esmari.31.t:0 "Crash on the waterway"

 flavor_esmari.32.t:0 "Trade depot on fire"
 flavor_esmari.32.d:0 "Someone got off the ship at night and burnt the nearby trade depot. Either an act of drunkeness or sabotage, the damage extended to other buildings."
 flavor_esmari.32.a:0 "ALAS!"
 flavor_esmari.33.t:0 "Boat full of smiths sinks"
 flavor_esmari.33.d:0 "Apparently, a bunch of muscular drunken men who know nothing of seafaring should not be grouped in one single boat."
 flavor_esmari.33.a:0 "Who let it happen?"
 flavor_esmari.34.t:0 "Terrific crash on waterway"
 flavor_esmari.34.d:0 "An entire fleet of river boats crashed between themselves, resulting in the waterway being obstructed for several days."
 flavor_esmari.34.a:0 "... how?"
 flavor_esmari.35.t:0 "Diplomatic blunder"
 flavor_esmari.35.d:0 "Aboard the ship a brawl erupted. Nothing exceptional here. Except it was between diplomats."
 flavor_esmari.35.a:0 "What were they even doing?"
 flavor_esmari.36.t:0 "Crash on the irrigation system"
 flavor_esmari.36.d:0 "How did they crash there? When? Why? And who did that? None of these questions will be answered. What is certain is that repairing the irrigation system will take serious admnistrative effort."
 flavor_esmari.36.a:0 "Damnation!"
 flavor_esmari.37.t:0 "General found dead"
 flavor_esmari.37.d:0 "He was found by a group of fishermen with their net. On his body, no wounds were found. He may have accidentally throw himself out of the boat while drunk. We'll never know for sure."
 flavor_esmari.37.a:0 "Oh, ashen skies!"
 flavor_esmari.38.t:0 "Admiral found dead at party"
 flavor_esmari.38.d:0 "Stab wound all over him. Brawls are common, but who brought a weapon?"

 flavor_esmari.39.t:0 "Merchant gifts load of weapons"

 flavor_esmari.40.t:0 "Influx of recruits"
 flavor_esmari.40.d:0 "Our soldiers have managed to impress a large number of attendees at the party, who consequently joined the army."
 flavor_esmari.40.a:0 "You're in the army now!"
 flavor_esmari.41.t:0 "Floating arms depot aren't a good idea"
 flavor_esmari.41.d:0 "Some of the boats crashed on a floating military depot at the center of the river. Much of the military equipment has been lost."

 flavor_esmari.42.t:0 "Terrific fire in the barracks"
 flavor_esmari.42.d:0 "One of the boats accidentally crashed on some barracks. And then caught fire. A big amount of military equipment and personnel has been lsot"
