 cannorian_1_medieval_knights:0 "Medieval Knights"
 cannorian_1medieval_knightsDESCRR:0 "The medieval Knight originated with the Castanorian hero Caylen Longlance's reforms, where mounted warriors were rewarded with grants of land for their military service. This concept of a powerful warrior elite spread through Cannor and became an integral part of the feudal system, in which knights ranked amongst the minor nobility. With the development of the wraparound saddle and stirrups, Knights became more heavily armored and better able to charge down opposing infantry with deadly force. They were also known to fight dismounted using heavy melee weapons when circumstances dictated it."

Knights and noble families would employ a number of men at arms to form their retinue. They would tend to be better armed and armored than the ordinary feudal footsoldier. During the Lilac Wars, Men at Arms were those soldiers who fought on horseback or with heavy weaponry, but were not of a high social standing and so could not be referred to as Knights. The better equipped and better trained were known as Sergeants at Arms."

 cannorian_9_pike_and_shot:0 "Pike & Shot"
 cannorian_9_pike_and_shotDESCR:0 "The Pike & Shot was a type of unit devised during the Late Greentide. Earlier variants had heavily armoured pikemen and halberdiers supported by embedded arquebusiers in order to both strike fear and gun down orcs and be able to face them in close combat. After the Greentide the armoured pikemen portion slowly fell out of favour to lighter cuirasses or no heavy armour at all."

 cannorian_12_thorn_formationDESCR:0 "Thorn Formation was developed principally by the Lorentish general Darien síl Ainethán during the Wars of Dominion. It was a mixed infantry formation of pikemen and musketeers. Because of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed both the rigidity of its heavy infantry and the long-range firepower of its musketeers, making it an ideal defensive and offensive formation. The Thorn Formation became infamous during the Wars of Dominion against Gawed, in which smaller, defensive and elite Lorentish forces could defeat the larger mass Gawedi infantry (who at that time were still primarily using melee weapons)."

 cannorian_15_volley_infantry:0 "Volley Infantry"
 cannorian_15_volley_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Halfling War of Independence the halfling armies were outmatched by the pike/musket combination of the Lorentish Thorn Formations. As halflings could not wield pikes due to their stature, they developed a new tactic relying on mass fire with lines twelve, six or eight musketeers deep. When the first ranked line fired, they would run move to the rear and the second line would fire. Due to the availability of muskets and more importanty, the large populations of halflings, this system negated the long reload relating to muskets, and stood well against the more defensive and stationary Thorn Formation."
 cannorian_18_reformed_outriders:0 "Reformed Outriders"
 cannorian_18_reformed_outridersDESCR:0 "The advent of more reliable and accurate guns reformed the army as a whole, moving to a lighter armoured infantry core that wielded rifles as their primary weapon.

 cannorian_23_dragoonsDESCR:0 "In 17th century Escann, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried, a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon (named after the core sigil of Escann). Dragoons were widely used by all Cannorian nations, mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 cannorian_23_line_infantry:0 "Line Infantry"
 cannorian_23_line_infantryDESCR:0 "Line infantry tactics tried to find a balance between attack and defense and did not specialize in either. However, these infantry were stronger in fire and shock.

 cannorian_26_carabinersDESCR:0 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the 16th century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers.

 cannorian_28_impulse_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Wars of the Northern League, the main Gawedi army was outmatched and faltering. To make up for this, irregular units from the military frontier were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed Gawedi armies. The use of loose order infantry was revolutionary on the European battlefield. The most extreme solution was the impulse warfare unit. These units put forward a cloud of skirmishers whose constant sniping would disorder and demoralize the enemy before the mass charge of columned infantry would deliver the coup de grace."
 cannorian_28_cuirassier:0 "Cuirassier"
