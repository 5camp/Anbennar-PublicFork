Originally a group of nomadic tribes, the §YKhamgunai§! people first arrived on the lakes in §Y680 BA§!. A hundred years later, more humans would immigrate to the region due to raging hordes of §YCentaurs§!, who fled to §YForbidden Plains§! after §YCastan II Beastbane§! burned down most of the §YDeepwoods§!.\n\nThe Triunic Lakes consists of plenty of arable land and some of the most fertile soil in the world, allowing it to easily maintain a population of millions of people. However, it wasn't until the §YDay of Ashen Skies§! that most of the remaining humans on the mainland migrated to the lakes and established more sedentary lifestyles.\n\nThe Triunic Lakes are divided into three cultures: the §YKhamgunai§! (the original settlers of the land), the §YMetsamic§! (tending to themselves in fortified cities), and the §YZabatlari§! (who have begun to dominate the economy).\n\nThere are also three religions in the region, each representing a lake which in turn represents a goddess: §YKodave§!, §YYukel§!, and §YEnuuk§!.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe §YLake Federation§! is in its infancy, only being formed in §Y1441§!. While there were previous precedents of unity such as the §YAmberpact§!, none were as ambitious or as encompassing as the federation, which attempted to finally end the petty internal squabbles of the lakes. However, this was only due to the recent Centaur invasion, which happened to be the largest and most devastating in Triunic history.\n\nNicknamed the §YGreat Incursion§!, the Centaur Shamans made use of the harshest winter ever recorded by locking the frozen lakes in place and using them as ice bridges, allowing huge centaur hordes to invade, wreaking havoc across the south. The path of blood finally ended in §Y1440§! with the hunting of the last shamans in §Y1439§!.\n\nYou lead a city-state in the north, the primary supporters of the Lake Federation. With the scars of the previous decade still largely visible in the lands of your southern compatriots and missing men from your fields, the foundation of the federation is shaky at best. Be aware of any crises that may come, as many city-states such as §YVahjevgiiv§! seek to expand their own domain for their own greed. Keep tabs on the Metsamic city-states, or the federation may well collapse. And still, its only a matter of time before the centaurs reorganise and reap a new path of blood once more...\n\nThe federation awaits your rule. Will you manage to unify the Triunic Lakes? Or will the city-states burn once more, either by their own hands or under the hooves of the centaurs?"

 string_start_forbidden_plains_description:0 "The Forbidden Plains is a large region in Northern Haless largely consisting of vast stretches of desert and steppe, a desertification process caused by the §YDay of Ashen Skies§!, populated mainly by migrating hordes of §YCentaurs§!. However, the northern region centred around the §YTriunic Lakes§! currently occupied by §YHumans§!, contains plenty of arable and green land, enough to feed millions of people. A nation of §YMountain Ogres§! lives in the west, bordering the §YDwarovar§!.\n\nWhile the §YSerpentspine§! largely isolate the Forbidden Plains from the rest of the world, there are several passes from the plain that lead to the outside world. The §YNorthern Sea§! is also a viable opportunity to expand eastwards.\n\nHistorically, both the Centaurs and the Triunic peoples have been divided into petty tribes and city-states respectively.\n\n Now, the Centaur tribes are attempting to reform into a united horde with the Triunic Lakes attempting to unify into the §YLake Federation§!.\n\n[Root.start_tributaries_descriptions]"

Three head priests interpret the will of their respective goddesses, with the priests below them serving their respective provinces.\n\nThe central and biggest lake represents §YYukel§!, the mother of the two other goddesses. Characterised by a crown of blue flowers and blonde hair, she represents the trade goddess.\n\nThe westmost and smallest lake represents §YKodave§!, the warrior goddess. It is said that she was the one who maintains the strength of her followers when the Centaurs sieged the southern cities. She is always characterised with wearing a steel and chainmail helmet.\n\n The eastmost lake represents §YEnuuk§!, the manufacturing goddess. Always wearing a white veil, it is rumoured she aids those in need and brings prosperity to the north. Many attribute §YQarshtuluu§!’s famous frosted glass to her."
