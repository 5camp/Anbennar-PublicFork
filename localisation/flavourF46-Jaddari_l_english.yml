 jaddari_mounted_legionaries_desc:0 "Since the return of the Phoenix Legions to Bulwar and their eventual settlement in the far Salahad, our armies have gone through many developments.

 jaddari_deal_with_the_xhazobkult_desc:0 "The duties of Surael are our own. And one of the greatest duties is that of fighting the darkness. There is no greater darkness than the demonic worship of the Xhazobkult. We must destroy it and break its power over the gnoll."

 jaddari_enlighten_the_gnoll_desc:0 "The gnolls close to our home have been brought into the light. However there are still many that live in Bulwar that follow the Xhazobkult. A great start has been made, but let us spread the truth to all gnolls, that they might truly be enlightened."

 jaddari_the_western_harpies_desc:0 "While the Saidunan harpies in the east have found themselves sociable and capable of reasonable dealings, the harpies in the west are found to be more difficult to deal with.

 jaddari_up_to_ovdal_tungr_desc:0 "Bahar is the great access to Cannor, and the great gate of Bahar is the hold of the Copper Dwarves. But since the Decades of Devastation the region is a mess.

 jaddari_the_subjugation_of_reuyel_title:0 "The Subjugation of Re'uyel"
 jaddari_the_subjugation_of_reuyel_desc:0 "The Republic of Re'uyel was the of those under the sway of the Sun Elves to throw off their shackles and stand up to their lies.

 jaddari_the_ports_of_businor_title:0 "The Ports of Businor"
 jaddari_the_ports_of_businor_desc:0 "The Divenhal is a great sea and we have found our navies and shipyards sadly lacking. If we manage to seize the ports of Businor we will be able to ensure total control over our portion of the sea and build up a navy so that no one can contest it."

 jaddari_summon_the_legionaries_title:0 "Summon the Legionaries"
 jaddari_summon_the_legionaries_desc:0 "It is time to start the great campaign. The Sun Elves in Bulwar have not fulfilled their duties to Surael and they have let the Xhazobkult rule too large an area. It is time someone more capable took over. Let us summon our armies and take this fate into our own hands."
 jaddari_seize_azka_sur_title:0 "Seize Azka-Sur"
 jaddari_seize_azka_sur_desc:0 "Azka-Sur, the fortress of the sun, is the furthest eastwards bastion of the Cult. It will serve as an example of our dominance over the Cult and the starting point for the spread of our faith. Its fertile lands can also make for a good base to build our empire upon."

 jaddari_upper_suran_plain_desc:0 "The Suran is the most important river of Bulwar. By capturing the upper plains we can start to reap the benefits of cultivatable land.

 jaddari_the_salahad_gate_title:0 "The Salahad Gate"
 jaddari_the_salahad_gate_desc:0 "Bulwar is a fortress for one who holds all of it. The Serpentspine guards its norther front and the Salahad its south and east. To the west is the Divenhal sea. There gates narrow passes and carvan paths that lead out and in. Holding those will allow total control of the entry and exit into and out of Bulwar.

 jaddari_spread_the_faith_title:0 "Spread the faith"
 jaddari_spread_the_faith_desc:0 "The Jadd has been established. But too many still don't contribute to the fight against the darkness. We shall convince them by word and by spear, and spread the truth to the rest of the world. The darkness shall be banished and Surael will be able to return."

 jaddari_reform_the_cult_desc:0 "We hold Bulwar, the heart of the Cult, and with that we hold their high priests.

A small tribe of Siadunan harpies captured a group of dying soldiers and saved them from death by dehydration. They nursed them back to life and an arrangement was made to exchange services.

 jaddari_missions.1.d:0 "The followers of the Jadd have seized the temple of Bulwar and with that the control of the high priests of the Cult. Under the influence of their Jaddari overlords the high priests have proclaimed that Sun Elves aren't the true successors of Surael, but that Jaddar was right and it is the duty of all those within the cult to do his duties. Some in our lands have found this convincing, but many look sceptically at this development. Now the decision is ours: How do we respond to this development?"
 jaddari_missions.1.a:0 "Ah! Capital!"
 jaddari_missions.1.b:0 "Just make sure they don't misbehave."
 jaddari_missions.1.c:0 "The heretics can rot!"
 jaddari_missions.2.t:0 "An Offer of Mutual Gain"
 jaddari_missions.2.d:0 "Our elven friends in Jaddari have approached us with an offer. Their ambassador has proposed a new arrangement between our nations. He talks of a grant of land, guaranteed self-rule and most importantly, freedom from the stigma of monsters that the world has seen us as. In return they ask for greater integration of our alliance. It is a good offer, but there are those who whisper that it's really just a way for them to subjugate us."

Our two nations will now be even more closely tied and in the future this will lead both our people advancing the light of the Jadd even more effectively."

 jaddari_missions.4.t:0 "Elayenna Refused Our Offer!"
 jaddari_missions.4.d:0 "Our envoys to Elayenna have returned. Their disheartened expressions show their failure. They bring word of the matriarch of Elayenna that our offer has been refused.

 jaddari_missions.5.d:0 "Ever since our glorious expedition into the darkness of the Serpentspine has been announced, it's all anyone has been able to talk about. Now it is also time for us to put something tangible behind our claims. To do such an expedition we need the proper men and equipment. The Dwarovar is dangerous and we won't be able to secure their safety as they head into the depths. Who should we even send? What will be our approach. The people are already starting to speculate."

They shall banish the dark from the serpentspine. But the tunnels of the Dwarovar span miles uncountable, the caves are infinite and the holds reach unknown depths. Where should we send our expedition. What is their goal?"

 jaddari_missions.7.d:0 "It has been many seasons since our expedition marched into the depths of the Dwarovar. We have been waiting with bated breath for their return. But as weeks turned into months and months turned into years, life returned to normal. Now it might really be time to declare the expedition lost. Who knows what happened to them? Maybe they succumbed to a goblin ambush. Maybe they encountered some sort of monster that dwells within the depths of the earth. Maybe they just lost their way? May Surael protect their souls."

Our guards initially throught they were under attack by some new group of orcs welling up from the dark caves of the Serpentspine, but soon saw that beneath the dirt and grime they were our trusted brothers of the Jadd. A light shone in their eyes as they carried heavy sacks of gold and treasure back to the light of Surael. After a wash and a well deserved rest, they have been received by [Root.Monarch.GetName] to tell [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] about their adventures in the deep dark. Bards are already telling their tales and the priests have pronounced their great service Surael."

The sound of heavy bootprints echoing through the halls initially brought panic to our miners, however soon it became clear that these were the enlightened steps of the Jadd expedition! Their victory over the darkness has rewarded them with many great treasures and even greaters experience!

Their adventure has taken them into the deepest, darkest pits of the Dwarovar and now they are back at the surface with amazing treasures and glorious tales. After a wash and a well deserved rest, these heroes of the Jadd have been received by [Root.Monarch.GetName] to tell [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] about their adventures in the deep dark. Bards are already telling their tales and the priests have pronounced their great service Surael."

 jaddari_missions.12.d:0 "It's a hot day in Bulwar. The vast expanse of the rivers and mountains are filled with the radiance of Surael, driving out the darkness and giving life to the lands. However here in the shadowy depths of the Deepwoods it is cool and refreshing. It's a place where the Light only sheldom comes, even now that the word of Surael has been brought here. [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes a deep breath of the scent of the forest and relaxes. Then [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sees her. A figure, is she an elf? clad in the forest approaches. Her voice seems to come from all around and, while [Root.Monarch.GetName] doesn't know the language, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] understands. She speaks of the forest and of its powers and age. Of the care she and her bretheren have for those that live within it, and how the forest is prepared to protect its interests. Both Courts will make sure of that. "So, mortal," speaks the Fey, "Why are you here?""
