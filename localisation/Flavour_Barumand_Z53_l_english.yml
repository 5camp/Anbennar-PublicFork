 barumand_smiths_of_tamashrug_title:0 "Smiths of Tamashrug"
 barumand_smiths_of_tamashrug_desc:0 "The area in what the Humans calls 'Vernham' is quite valuable, having been home to many a smiths and armouries before our brothers sacked it. It is quite acute that we repair the local facilities to pump out iron and blades for the armies of Barumand. Thankfully our increased cooperation and integration of the Humans has allowed us to repair and improve on the local goods, added with Orcish strength the smiths of Tamashrug forge again."

 barumand_sharpen_blade_title:0 "Sharpening the Blade"
 barumand_sharpen_blade_desc:0 "If we wish to liberate the people of Escann from the tyrannical lords of Cannor and fear of hunger, we must first sharpen the metaphorical blade of our armies. We shall push more for a well trained army and of course, the literal sharpened blades that our brand new smiths can give us."

 barumand_west_entrance_title:0 "The West Entrance"
 barumand_west_entrance_desc:0 "To our south lay the Deepwoods, a bane in any nation's backside. These lands are home to the Fey, and not much else is known to the inhabitants of this place, we are led to believe a contingent of Dookanson's followers ended up in this hell of mazes and leaves but nothing is known of their fate. We shall build a gate in the Western Entrance, as to try and block anyone going in, and especially block anything from coming out, for what lies in those woods could be waiting to pounce at the farmlands of Castanor."

 barumand_permanent_embassies_title:0 "Permanent Embassies"
 barumand_permanent_embassies_desc:0 "The establishment of permanent embassies in our subjects would help keep up relations between eachother. We shall temporarily concede livestock production to the nobility to fund this endeavour, as the construction of these embassies shall be costy, but it is a worthwhile investment for our future."

 barumand_tamashrug_university_title:0 "Tamashrug University"
 barumand_tamashrug_university_desc:0 "Tamashrug has grown into a fledgling city in it's own right, from the day we repaired it's forges and plunged it into a future of steel and blade, we prepared it for prosperity. However every Orc needs more than just an axe and armour, and Tamashrug is home to some of the brightest Orcs in our nation, thanks to the extensive training these Smiths have in order to keep pumping out our steel. However, as we learn more about the Cannorians and their diverse lands, we have come to find that the greatest minds of these lands are the Gnomes, earliest users of Artififcery and the inventers of many great devices, that even our richest are able to afford. Let us seek out a group of Gnomes willing to assist our fledgling nation, in the construction of a great place of education, the University of Tamashrug."

 barumand_their_fruit_title:0 "Their Fruit"
 barumand_their_fruit_desc:0 "The trade and goods that flow through Eastern Cannor are generally delicacies to the average Barumandi Orc, this is because the majority of food production and flow through these lands are from our farmlands, and so the Kruman can spend more producing luxury goods, this of course is prime for investment from us, as we have the money and we have the influence to further their trade income, and return our investment."

 barumand_long_march_title:0 "The Long March"
 barumand_long_march_desc:0 "The lands in the east aren't steady, they are backed against the Serpentspine mountains and are covered in forests, this will be no easy task, but a long march that our soldiers will treck through even if they lose all energy. We must prepare the state for the liberation of the Escanni peoples!"

 barumand_below_the_wall_title:0 "Push Below the Wall"
 barumand_below_the_wall_desc:0 "With the lands in the east of south Castanor safely in our grasp, we should secure the lands below the white walls as to secure any possible invasion from the north, as well as to secure the gold mines near the foothills of the West Dwarovar. In addition to securing these lands, we should restore the local infratructure and uplift the locals from the devasation caused by the Greentide, the age of adventurers and our conquests."

 barumand_steady_state_title:0 "The Steady State"
 barumand_steady_state_desc:0 "After many years of conquest and rebuilding we have finally established ourselves as the steady state of Eastern Cannor. We have risen to a position none thought we could, and as such we can push forward into the future with little to no worry of collapse. Our next step is to determine what is to be done with the rowdy and warmongering north, should we continue our path of retribution and grain output, they might end their conflicts, but the future is a mystery to all those who watch"

 barumand_strong_alliances_title:0 "Strong Alliances"
 barumand_strong_alliances_desc:0 "If we are to continue our steady existence in this modern age, we must secure alliances, strong ones we can rely on for centuries to come, let us reach out to see who'll support us."

 barumand_let_us_in_title:0 "They Let Us in"
 barumand_let_us_in_desc:0 "Despite how humiliating the first landsmeet of Barumand was, the few who did join us were interested in our proposals, we should establish influence over them through a tribute system. The system would entail us protecting them, and in return they will pay us a desired good. Whilst this may seem like we're extending our influence, we are merely trying to protect the Escanni people and if we must put our men in the court of every kingdom in Escann, we will do just that. However it is in our best interest that we do these things diplomatically, so let us propose this system to the neighbouring Escannis and figure out what to do with the rest later."

 barumand_taller_taller_desc:0 "As our grain production and demand rises, we require larger, no, TALLER storage. Some may call this unplanned, and unsafe, but our top engineers assure us that the "WAAAAGH" in these silos is strong enough to support our increasing population, and to keep these containers from collapsing."

 barumand_willing_army_title:0 "Army of the Willing"
 barumand_willing_army_desc:0 "If we are to show Escann our willingness to change, we must first show that our armies are not of Orcs serving for their own gain of loot and plunder, but instead Orcs who are willing to fight for the freedom of their lands and not loot them. May our army of the willing grant liberation to South Castanor."

 barumand_fields_forests_title:0 "Fields and Forests"
 barumand_fields_forests_desc:0 "The toughest terrain in South Castanor is the forests in the west, that does not mean they are tough to conquer though, through our willing army we will claim these lands for Barumand, so that we can prepare them for a prosperous future, maybe even ready them for farming purposes. Of course we can choose to let humans and nobles settle these lands to show we aren't monsters, but time will tell once we finish the domination in the South."

 barumand_landsmeet_desc:0 "We have finally established ourselves in South Castanor, and with a state as steady as ours, we are ready to enter an age of prosperity and with new plans brought to us by our greatest diplomats, we have forged an idea of absolute diplomatic dominance over Eastern Cannor through a system of margianally autonomous states known as Kruman. We will invite all of the petty kings of Escann to our capital for a glorious party where we will announce our plans, and if all goes well, they will agree and the interfighting in our great homeland will stop. Right?"

 barumand_nuzrandu_desc:0 "Nuzrandu, or our vision of the future, the future to see Eastern Cannor in peace, fed and kept from the woes of wars. Our Krumani system so far has done wonders to keep the humans away from the bloodshed and devastation of war, but this autonomy could lead to rebellion, and rebellion would risk our new future. So we have 2 choices, continue this autonomy, this would allow us to focus on the prime lands of South Castanor, and keep these subjects out of the wars we fight. However, our current hold over the Kruman would allow us to fully integrate them all, which would put us in a strong seat of power in the growing centralising states of Halcann, but would also open our human subjects to the woes of war, what we choose shall decide the Nuzrandu of Barumand."
