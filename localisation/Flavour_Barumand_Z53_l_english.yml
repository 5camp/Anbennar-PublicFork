 barumand_smiths_of_tamashrug_title:0 "Smiths of Tamashrug"
 barumand_smiths_of_tamashrug_desc:0 "The area in what the Humans calls 'Vernham' is quite valuable, having been home to many a smiths and armouries before our brothers sacked it. It is quite acute that we repair the local facilities to pump out iron and blades for the armies of Barumand. Thankfully our increased cooperation and integration of the Humans has allowed us to repair and improve on the local goods, added with Orcish strength the smiths of Tamashrug forge again."

 barumand_sharpen_blade_title:0 "Sharpening the Blade"
 barumand_sharpen_blade_desc:0 "If we wish to liberate the people of Escann from the tyrannical lords of Cannor and fear of hunger, we must first sharpen the metaphorical blade of our armies. We shall push more for a well trained army and of course, the literal sharpened blades that our brand new smiths can give us."

 barumand_west_entrance_title:0 "The West Entrance"
 barumand_west_entrance_desc:0 "To our south lay the Deepwoods, a bane in any nation's backside. These lands are home to the Fey, and not much else is known to the inhabitants of this place, we are led to believe a contingent of Dookanson's followers ended up in this hell of mazes and leaves but nothing is known of their fate. We shall build a gate in the Western Entrance, as to try and block anyone going in, and especially block anything from coming out, for what lies in those woods could be waiting to pounce at the farmlands of Castanor."

 barumand_permanent_embassies_title:0 "Permanent Embassies"
 barumand_permanent_embassies_desc:0 "The establishment of permanent embassies in our subjects would help keep up relations between eachother. We shall temporarily concede livestock production to the nobility to fund this endeavour, as the construction of these embassies shall be costy, but it is a worthwhile investment for our future."

 barumand_tamashrug_university_title:0 "Tamashrug University"
 barumand_tamashrug_university_desc:0 "Tamashrug has grown into a fledgling city in it's own right, from the day we repaired it's forges and plunged it into a future of steel and blade, we prepared it for prosperity. However every Orc needs more than just an axe and armour, and Tamashrug is home to some of the brightest Orcs in our nation, thanks to the extensive training these Smiths have in order to keep pumping out our steel. However, as we learn more about the Cannorians and their diverse lands, we have come to find that the greatest minds of these lands are the Gnomes, earliest users of Artififcery and the inventers of many great devices, that even our richest are able to afford. Let us seek out a group of Gnomes willing to assist our fledgling nation, in the construction of a great place of education, the University of Tamashrug."

 barumand_their_fruit_title:0 "Their Fruit"
 barumand_their_fruit_desc:0 "The trade and goods that flow through Eastern Cannor are generally delicacies to the average Barumandi Orc, this is because the majority of food production and flow through these lands are from our farmlands, and so the Kruman can spend more producing luxury goods, this of course is prime for investment from us, as we have the money and we have the influence to further their trade income, and return our investment."

 barumand_long_march_title:0 "The Long March"
 barumand_long_march_desc:0 "The lands in the east aren't steady, they are backed against the Serpentspine mountains and are covered in forests, this will be no easy task, but a long march that our soldiers will treck through even if they lose all energy. We must prepare the state for the liberation of the Escanni peoples!"

 barumand_below_the_wall_title:0 "Push Below the Wall"
 barumand_below_the_wall_desc:0 "With the lands in the east of south Castanor safely in our grasp, we should secure the lands below the white walls as to secure any possible invasion from the north, as well as to secure the gold mines near the foothills of the West Dwarovar. In addition to securing these lands, we should restore the local infratructure and uplift the locals from the devasation caused by the Greentide, the age of adventurers and our conquests."

 barumand_steady_state_title:0 "The Steady State"
 barumand_steady_state_desc:0 "After many years of conquest and rebuilding we have finally established ourselves as the steady state of Eastern Cannor. We have risen to a position none thought we could, and as such we can push forward into the future with little to no worry of collapse. Our next step is to determine what is to be done with the rowdy and warmongering north, should we continue our path of retribution and grain output, they might end their conflicts, but the future is a mystery to all those who watch"

 barumand_strong_alliances_title:0 "Strong Alliances"
 barumand_strong_alliances_desc:0 "If we are to continue our steady existence in this modern age, we must secure alliances, strong ones we can rely on for centuries to come, let us reach out to see who'll support us."

 barumand_let_us_in_title:0 "They Let Us in"
 barumand_let_us_in_desc:0 "Despite how humiliating the first landsmeet of Barumand was, the few who did join us were interested in our proposals, we should establish influence over them through a tribute system. The system would entail us protecting them, and in return they will pay us a desired good. Whilst this may seem like we're extending our influence, we are merely trying to protect the Escanni people and if we must put our men in the court of every kingdom in Escann, we will do just that. However it is in our best interest that we do these things diplomatically, so let us propose this system to the neighbouring Escannis and figure out what to do with the rest later."

 barumand_show_kindness_title:0 "Showing Kindness"
 barumand_show_kindness_desc:0 "If we are to show Escann that we are well meaning, we must display our diplomacy by rewarding the subjects we have acquired. We shall do this by subsidising their grain production so that they can feed their people."

 barumand_our_labour_title:0 "Our Labour"
 barumand_our_labour_desc:0 "Grain! Grain! GRAIN! Our labour is the peak of agriculture, every Orcish landowner wakes to farm, for the country, for their families and for the future of Eastern Cannor. Atleast that's what our criers tell, as advanced as our agricultural centres are, we still have to up production if we are to feed the people of Eastern Cannor. Thankfully with government investments and the support of our farmers, upping production to new leaps should be simple."

 barumand_taller_taller_title:0 "Build Them Taller"
 barumand_taller_taller_desc:0 "As our grain production and demand rises, we require larger, no, TALLER storage. Some may call this unplanned, and unsafe, but our top engineers assure us that the "WAAAAGH" in these silos is strong enough to support our increasing population, and to keep these containers from collapsing."

 barumand_grain_lord_title:0 "Lords of Grain"
 barumand_grain_lord_desc:0 "Over the years, our farmers, researchers, magess and advisors have spent large amounts of time and effort to perfect the production of grain. Our bread and wheat flows into Cannor as 'Made in Barumand' being the selling point, people flock to markets in hopes of tasting our fulfilling and perfected Grain. Some dub our farmers and [Ruler.GetTitle] the grain lords, and this title is befitting of the largest producers of Grain in Cannor, producing more than even the halflings of the Small Country."

 barumand_south_wall_title:0 "Southern Wall"
 barumand_south_wall_desc:0 "To our south lay an unbreakable wall known as the Godshield. We have based one of our grain silos against this range of mountains as it allows us to place construction supports along it. Now with little to no assistance from the Dwarves, we have begun plans on a Hold of Grain, which despite it's name is less a Dwarven hold, and more a huge grain silo that scales the mountains near Shieldrest, we'll also use the newly renovated areas for defense planning for the future of Barumand."

 barumand_willing_army_title:0 "Army of the Willing"
 barumand_willing_army_desc:0 "If we are to show Escann our willingness to change, we must first show that our armies are not of Orcs serving for their own gain of loot and plunder, but instead Orcs who are willing to fight for the freedom of their lands and not loot them. May our army of the willing grant liberation to South Castanor."

 barumand_fields_forests_title:0 "Fields and Forests"
 barumand_fields_forests_desc:0 "The toughest terrain in South Castanor is the forests in the west, that does not mean they are tough to conquer though, through our willing army we will claim these lands for Barumand, so that we can prepare them for a prosperous future, maybe even ready them for farming purposes. Of course we can choose to let humans and nobles settle these lands to show we aren't monsters, but time will tell once we finish the domination in the South."

 barumand_develop_agriculture_title:0 "Develop Agriculture"
 barumand_develop_agriculture_desc:0 "Before, we learned what little we knew of farming from the skeletons of ruined farmsteads, the sagging ditches of their irrigation, and the mangled fences of their pastures. Now we learn firsthand from the humans who have come to know us as more than monsters. We learn the intricacies of crop rotations, the trick of angling barns to the wind, the layering of straw to keep livestock warm in the winter, and many more things large and small that humanity picked up through millennia of cultivation. With this knowledge we will rebuild the farms, redig the ditches, and repair the fences, with this we will bring about a new way of farming, the Orcish way."

 barumand_east_entrance_title:0 "The East Entrance"
 barumand_east_entrance_desc:0 "The new farmlands we have cultivated must be defended. While The Army of The Willing keeps our harvests safe from the threats of escann there are elusive foes to our south, foes with fey influence and fell aims, against whom we must prepare a stronger vigilance. Fortifiactions, watch towers, patrols, and signal fires will be implemented at The Eastern Entrance, no southern foe shall approach without our knowing, and no foe at all shall enter!"

 barumand_peace_mind_title:0 "Peace In Mind"
 barumand_peace_mind_desc:0 "Prior to building our Capital, our vast farms, or our fortifications we chose to build a new self. Now that all of South Castanor lies safely in the control of our new orcish state, and the Rage of our people manifested in the Sarkub-Kashr has subsided we can finally declare our journey has come to its conclusion. The new Barumandi orc harbors not a strength through rage, but a cool and calculated power. Well-tempered and trained as is proven both by the small everyday actions of our citizens, and the talented diplomacy of our State."

 barumand_landsmeet_title:0 "Escanni Landsmeet"
 barumand_landsmeet_desc:0 "We have finally established ourselves in South Castanor, and with a state as steady as ours, we are ready to enter an age of prosperity and with new plans brought to us by our greatest diplomats, we have forged an idea of absolute diplomatic dominance over Eastern Cannor through a system of margianally autonomous states known as Kruman. We will invite all of the petty kings of Escann to our capital for a glorious party where we will announce our plans, and if all goes well, they will agree and the interfighting in our great homeland will stop. Right?"

 barumand_into_our_cause_title:0 "Into Our Cause"
 barumand_into_our_cause_desc:0 "The Kruman system has allowed us to extend our influence over all of Escann and has showed its people they can place their faith in us without worry. With this the time has come for a second Landsmeet. The first may have failed to join our purposes with the other Escanni, but next to the calculations and preparations we have put together, not to mention the extent of new resources we have available for this attempt, the first landsmeet will soon look like a village market. In this Grand improved Landsmeet the cause of Barumand will be united with Kruman and Tributary, for the prosperity of all Escann."

 barumand_outer_grainaries_title:0 "Outer Grainaries"
 barumand_outer_grainaries_desc:0 "While the site at Mereham is now complete, it is now clear that no matter how tall we build the Silo it will not be large enough. Two more sites, one in Shieldrest to the south, and the other in Westgate to the North. This will make sure every corner of our state is protected from famine, and able to benefit from our grandest constructions."

 barumand_escann_liberated_title:0 "Escann's Liberator"
 barumand_escann_liberated_desc:0 "It is done. Barumand has defended Escann from invaders, and unified her people under our influence. For the first time in centuries, Escann is now finally able to stand united, a bulwark of Corin and Prosperity that the rest of the world seeks to envy."

 barumand_power_gates_title:0 "Gates Upon Power"
 barumand_power_gates_desc:0 "Southgate and Westgate are the primary entrances and exits to the inside of the walls of Castanor, and thereby in turn all of Inner Castanor. Both gates are not what they once were, but with Escann now under the righteous rule of us and our Kruman we have the resources to reconstruct them. These new gates to the centre of Escann, The Gates of Celebration and Emergency, will cement our hold on the region. Passing through them will be the joy of those loyal to Barumand, for they shall stand as monuments to our protection and providal to all the peoples of Escann!"

 barumand_nuzrandu_title:0 "Nuzrandu"
 barumand_nuzrandu_desc:0 "Nuzrandu, or our vision of the future, the future to see Eastern Cannor in peace, fed and kept from the woes of wars. Our Krumani system so far has done wonders to keep the humans away from the bloodshed and devastation of war, but this autonomy could lead to rebellion, and rebellion would risk our new future. So we have 2 choices, continue this autonomy, this would allow us to focus on the prime lands of South Castanor, and keep these subjects out of the wars we fight. However, our current hold over the Kruman would allow us to fully integrate them all, which would put us in a strong seat of power in the growing centralising states of Halcann, but would also open our human subjects to the woes of war, what we choose shall decide the Nuzrandu of Barumand."

 barumand_escann_blade_title:0 "Escann's Blade"
 barumand_escann_blade_desc:0 "The pre-greentide kingdoms of old grew lazy. Complacent. They paid for this folly. Barumand will not repeat their mistake. Even in times of peace, every Barumandi Orc keeps a blade or a barrel on him in case of unseen threat. Farmers gladly report for muster when they need to, as they understand that their prosperity only exists because of their will to defend it. This may seem strange to outsiders, but in Barumand, it is just a way of life. Outsiders have taken to calling us Escann's Blade. We see this as a great compliment, because if they see us as the sword defending Escann nobody would dare make us swing. "Invading Barumand is a difficult task, as you fight through every inch of land, you come across a bush, and behind every bush, is an Orc with a freshly sharpened blade, or newly polished barrel pointing at you." - Lain Silcalas, 1654, On the Peoples of a New Escann"

 barumand_change_within_title:0 "Change From Within"
 barumand_change_within_desc:0 "Impressions of us will remain hateful for many years despite anything we show to the world, that is why the important thing is that we show that we can change, not outward, but inward to ourselves. Let the confidence of Barumand’s orcs grow as they each day see themselves becoming more honourable, more tolerant, and more kind. The escanni may not care that we try to change, but when we show them that we will change for the better whether they care or not their eyes shall be forced to open!"

 barumand_orc_capital_title:0 "Capital of the Orcs"
 barumand_orc_capital_desc:0 "When we first invaded Escann, its lands were plundered under the armies of Dookanson. Now, the lands and cities we hold lay devastated, in ruin, and depopulated. Moreover, we need a place to call our home and to set up our rule over the lands of Eastern Castanor, and to protect the orcs that remain in Escann. The sites of Ionntras, Banesfork, and Vernham are but some of the places suitable for a home of our own."

 barumand_better_farming_methods_title:0 "Better Farming Methods"
 barumand_better_farming_methods_desc:0 "The lands of South Castanor are fertile, and have provided us with more food than previous generations of our kind had even dreamed of. However, we barely knew the basics of farming, and only from the corpses of farmers and their abandoned farmsteads. Now we were getting closer to starvation each passing winter. 
It is time for Barumund to learn from the humans from the rest of Cannor, to learn their ways of farming so we can make better use of the rich lands we hold, as well as reconstuct some of the farmsteads destroyed during the Greentide to keep ourselves fed."

 barumand_grain_state_title:0 "The Grain State"
 barumand_grain_state_desc:0 "As we become increacingly dependant on agriculture, it becomes incresingly clear that one bad year of crops could ruin us. To prevent this, we shall build the largest grain silo in Cannor. A perfect site has been found, on the southern tip of Lake Silvermere. We should develop this area into a town suitable town to support the logistical challenge of filling this store. "

 barumand_some_refuse_title:0 "But Some Refuse"
 barumand_some_refuse_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to show the other Escanni the many benefits of entwining their states to Baramund, some still refused. This is truly their loss, as they have left us with absoluletly no choice but to bring them into the fold by using the ultimate tool of diplomacy: war. "

 barumand_their_diplomacy_title:0 "Their Way of DIplomacy"
 barumand_their_diplomacy_desc:0 "One thing we Orcs have learned since coming to the surface is the Human love for gold. We have plenty of the stuff lying around. By giving them gold, we can link the Cannorians to ourselves. "

 barumand_corin_duty_title:0 "Corin's Sworn Duty"
 barumand_corin_duty_desc:0 "Our duty, passed down to us from Corin, is to defend Escann. Just as she protected Escann from our ancestors before we called it home, we must now repel outsiders from the rest of Cannor who seek influence within Escann. Escann for the Escanni, Cannor for the Cannorians. "

 barumand_adean_rest_title:0 "Laying Adean to Rest"
 barumand_adean_rest_desc:0 "Since the birth of the nation of Barumand, Corin has been one of the most important figures to our nation for all citizens, orc and human alike. Naturally, we support her claim as the rightful leader of the Regent Court, not the pretender Adean. As our influence has spread throughout Escann, the other escanni have come to agree with our stance. Adean has few followers left in Escann, and his claim has been put to rest.  "

 barumand_third_landsmeet_title:0 "The Third Landsmeet"
 barumand_third_landsmeet_desc:0 "The second Landsmeet aimed for peace in Escann by the removal of foreign invaders, and now with the efforts of us and our Kruman this dream of a lasting peace for all Escann has been forged. Let the summons cry out through the Corin-Blessed fields, hills, and forests: the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Baranthad, liberator of Escann calls all Kruman to [Root.Capital.GetName] for the hosting of the third Landsmeet! Both to celebrate the peace we have achieved, and to present our new goals to our subjects. "

 barumand_escann_heart_title:0 "Escann's Heart"
 barumand_escann_heart_desc:0 "Castonath is Escann's stone heart, the thrumm of the city rhyming with the beat of our own hearts. Unfortunately, the nearby silo is in need of massive renovations and improvments. With this silo, the stone city will become even more vibrant than ever before. Work must begin on these projects post haste. "

 barumand_smaller_beat_title:0 "Smaller Beats"
 barumand_smaller_beat_desc:0 "While Castonath is indubitably the heart of Escann, that doesn't mean we should ignore the rest of the land. The smaller heart beats of Eastern Cannor are just as important as Castonath. Ionntras, Silvervord, Vernham and the other great cities we have built must also be tended to, and they will be made into the beating heart of their own areas. They will become centers for learning, manufacturing, and art to rival any other in Cannor, and many will move to our nation from across Cannor to be a part of our success."

 barumand_corins_teachings_title:0 "Corin's Teachings"
 barumand_corins_teachings_desc:0 "Pillage. Slaughter. Destruction. Glory.  These were the princapals that led our forefathers out of the Serpentspine. As generation upon generation of Orc Grows up in Escann, his temperment has mellowed and turned their focus towards the long term. Aroka Oakbreaker, who served with Corin as part of her Circle against our ancestors in the Greentide, has become a key figure in helping move away from those traditions, passing Corin's teachings onto our young nation. Despite this, she would then join with the burgeoning Barumandi state in its moment of weakness, and was a shining example of what orcs could become in this new green land. Alligning the state and clergy with her on this matter will help foster this shift to new values, representing the orcs of today. Honor, Tolerance, Diligence, and Bravery will be the values that every young Barumandi will strive for.  From Corin, to Aroka, to Barumand."

 barumand_mending_relations_title:0 "Mending Past Relations"
 barumand_mending_relations_desc:0 "As we consolidated our state, enemies we naturally stepped on the toes of the other new Escanni settlers, orc human or otherwise. Making common cause with these other groups will show them that we have changed, and are no longer looking to cause violence in Escann, but will instead promote peace in our shared new home. "

 barumand_fortify_the_borders_title:0 "So Fortify The Borders"
 barumand_fortify_the_borders_desc:0 "Corvuria. The one kingdom of Escann who was untouched by the Greentide. They remain strong, and what we heard from the Ravenmarchers we integrated long ago... troubles us. They are the largest threat left near our heartland. We must establish a series of fortifications, while simultaneously sending ex-Ravenmarch agents into Arca Corvur and Gablaine to discover any plots they may have against us."

 barumand_strike_them_down_title:0 "And Strike Them Down"
 barumand_strike_them_down_desc:0 "It quickly became clear that the Corvurian nobility was preparing an attack against us. Thus, we will take it upon ourselves to strike them down first. Raven Banner was an adventuring company during the Greentide aftermath led by Scions of the Sil Vivin family that was quickly integrated into Barumand. One of their line married an Orcish woman, and now that Half-Orc child has proven himself a capable young man. Putting him in charge of Corvuria will ensure that they never again challenge us. "

 flavour_barumand.1.d:0 "Aroka Oakbreaker was an Orc in Corin's party during her attempts to stop the Greentide, whilst this was a traitorous decision, we cannot forsake her teachings, upon which she brought to us during our darkest hour, training our troops, and spreading the teachings of Corin, we shall uphold these teachings and show tolerance to those different to us."

 flavour_barumand.2.d:0 "As the Army of the Willing advances across Escann, they cant help but notice how empty it is. Fields lay fallow. Mills in disrepair. Mines remain dark. While orcs could be moved in to work these areas, [Monarch.GetName] recently had an idea with much merit. Send the most diplomatic of our kind to the people of Western Cannor, asking them to come and settle lands we recently conquered from human adventurer bands, blending into their societies. This will help integrate us with greater Cannorian society, and their letters home will help convince the world that the Greentide is over, and Barumandi Orcs are turning over a new leaf. "

 flavour_barumand.8.d:0 "We have reconstructed the cities of Ionntras, Banesfork, and Vernham, as well as developed our current capital. Now we must consider a capital to protect Orcs for the coming centuries.

Our first choice is Ionntras to the north, it is in a great position for establishing ourselves in Escann. Whilst no Castonath, its position near the local rivers and its proximity to the centre of Escann is priceless.

The second choice is Banesfork which lies along another set of local rivers, would be a good place to keep an eye on the Deepwoods and is a hub for trade in the region.

As for our final choice, we have Vernham which was a place for many of Escann's smiths and armouries. There, once we invite the smiths back into Vernham, it would allow us orcs to arm ourselves with much sharper and stronger steel.

Or perhaps we'll build up the capital in which we have resided in since the end of Rottenstep, it has served us well, and if need be, it will continue its service forevermore."

To make diplomacy with an Orc made you just as brutish and monstrous as us, but now we have decided to revert these beliefs, by sending out a formal invitation to the many humans of Eastern Cannor, and meeting of all the lands, a Landsmeet.

However upon the beginning of the first feast, only a few humans showed up, and about half of them were messengers with insults and depravities about the [Ruler.GetTitle], and the rest had only sent ambassadors in their stead, whilst we can understand the caution of an Orc inviting them, have we not shown our generousity with our upkeep of the human lord's rights to their previous titles, the upkeep of human cities and the supression of our rage. 

We shall send back these messengers with words of the Landsmeet's goals and how we intend to pursue them. Hopefully the lords of these lands will see it right to join our cause, and if not... We'll just have to use alternative diplomacy."

The people who settled these lands after the Greentide hold the claim to these lands, and as such we shall uphold their claims, liberating core Escann land, and developing the land we hold already.
