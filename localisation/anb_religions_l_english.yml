Followers of this philosophy are uninterested by spirituality; instead focusing on creating and refining a “Theory of Everything” that explains exactly how reality works. Members are driven to observe and analyse the material world, in the hopes of being able to incorporate their discoveries to the doctrine in an act known as “Being touched by The Thought”. This drive towards material analysis and innovation leads to followers of the Thought being well-suited to the pursuit of scientific advancement and the development of artifice; gnomish believers in the Thought were the first to combine magic and science into the art now known as artificery. Those who follow The Thought are usually very tolerant to other ways of thinking, as they both hold the product of other people’s intelligence in high regard, and take advantage of the opportunity to research into other cultures."

It is said that a hall of a hundred storytellers couldn't tell the full Dwarven folklore even if they had a hundred years to do it. Their story was ancient by the time of Aul-Dwarov, and the rise and fall of that great empire only left behind more tragedies and tales of grandeur. Inspired by the heroes of old, many dwarves look towards the Dwarovar, All-Dwarves-Home, in order to reclaim the history and lands they have lost."

It was where the Dwarovkron was forged to unify all dwarfkind, and it was where the High Assembly of Holds met to advise its bearer. It was also where the surface terrace farms of the Serpent's Vale were managed, in which the High King could feed all his subjects food to sustain themselves in the dark depths of the mountain."
   HOLY_SITE_4311_DESC:0 "Grônstunad wasn’t the first hold founded after the Tree of Stone was breached, but no doubt one of the wealthiest. It grew quickly, overflowing with deposits of jade that were extracted and shipped west, creating a ‘jade rush’ composed of dwarves looking to find such a great deposit, or escape the dwarven wars of unification in the west. Eventually the west fell to the new orc menace and Grônstunad became the greatest Dwarven city in existence... for a time. By the time the surviving dwarves of the west regained the confidence to make contact with the east Grônstunad was no more, and was now the home of the hobgoblin race."
   HOLY_SITE_2931_DESC:0 "Er-Natvir was not only one of the core cities of the Dwarovar, but also the hub in which all rails sprouted from. All goods passing through to and from the capital passed through this hold, and the libraries, holding uncountable trade records, are a beautiful site to behold- a testament of Dwarven organization. Even in the final days of this city, goods were still recorded- mostly arms."
   HOLY_SITE_4078_DESC:0 "Named after Hehogrim the Diligent, Hehodovar was where many of the first holds were designed and architected. Based at the centre of the Dwarovar, it was allegedly the first capital of the dwarven peoples but by the time of unification it had become a place of the practical arts of crafting and building."
   HOLY_SITE_2963_DESC:0 "Jorkad Hall was a hold of no importance... until one day a dark scourge emerged from its depths. These beasts were named after the hold itself, but to the greater world, they were known by a simpler name: Orcs. Deadlier than the goblins that had infested the mountains, the orcish threat brought doom to upon dwarves. Since that day, dwarfkind lost their dominion over the mountains, and over the millennia more and more holds would perish under the orcish menace."
   HOLY_SITE_4093_DESC:0 "Arg-Ôrdstun was the capital of the Serpent's Reach, who in its day was oft unified against the High King of Aul-Dwarov. Meaning the Diamond Reach, it is said that the riches of the Dwarovar was controlled by the Ôrdstunic dwarves, and many diamonds to this day can trace its origin back to this powerful hold."
   HOLY_SITE_4269_DESC:0 "It was said that Halanna, the Earthmother, created the first dwarves in Earthseed, and it was with their help that the fine details of the world were perfected. When she died it was said that her heart was buried in her most favourite places, in order to watch over her finest creations from beyond - indeed, she did, and now the depths that Earthseed finds itself has now earned the namesake relating to Halanna: the Tree of Stone."

Ravelianists are part-scholar, part-preacher, and believe in unraveling the secrets of the world to discover and spread its fundamental Truths. A large number of these revelations come from their research in the God Fragment, a strange shard-like device that communicates in a near-undecipherable language that claims that it is the last portion of divinity, and that the precursor elves stole God's divinity and turned it into what we know today as magic. A popular tenet in the Ravelian faith is their wish to use artificery to bring this stolen magic to all."

There he encountered a strange city, named Celmaldor, inhabited by the Moon Elves, of all people. With the snake of his tongue, Leif convinced the Elves to elect him as the leader of their republic."
