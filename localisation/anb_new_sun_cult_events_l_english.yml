  new_sun_cult.1.t:0 "The Clergy Pulls Away"
 new_sun_cult.1.d:0 "The clergy says they answer only to the will of Surael’s chosen and therefore refuse to bow to the commands of a non sun elf government."
 new_sun_cult.1.a:0 "We thought they might do this."
 new_sun_cult.2.t:0 "The Elves Pull Away"
 new_sun_cult.2.d:0 "With the new human recruits flooding into the armies and rising to higher ranks within it, we can no longer call what we have an elven military. It is more of a combination now, and thoroughly dominated in numbers by humans."
 new_sun_cult.2.a:0 "We’ll have to promote new officers fast."
 new_sun_cult.3.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Proves [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Military Prowess"
 new_sun_cult.3.d:0 "It is improper for the general populace to see their ruler so... involved in martial, worldly, affairs. If we want to keep things as they are, we should ask [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to go back to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace and let other, lesser, beings lead our armies."
 new_sun_cult.3.a:0 "We will see how things play out."
 new_sun_cult.4.t:0 "A True Battle[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 new_sun_cult.4.d:0 "The frequent sight of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] winning glorious victories in the name of Surael has caused the people to see [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as rooted in the real world; less divine and more divinely empowered."
 new_sun_cult.4.a:0 "Oh well, at least [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] likes fighting."
 new_sun_cult.5.t:0 "A Loss in Faith"
 new_sun_cult.5.d:0 "Our beloved ruler has died, and the way forward becomes cloudy. How could Surael’s chosen leave us in such turmoil?"
 new_sun_cult.5.a:0 "Hopefully His light shall guide us through"
 new_sun_cult.6.t:0 "A Loss in Faith"
 new_sun_cult.6.d:0 "Our overlord has passed and with him Surael’s Light grows dimmer. How could they leave us with such turmoil in their wake?"
 new_sun_cult.6.a:0 "We must find His light, and pick up the pieces, as best we can."
 new_sun_cult.7.t:0 "no Moh setup"
 new_sun_cult.7.d:0 ""
 new_sun_cult.7.a:0 "Ok"
 new_sun_cult.8.t:0 "Lucian Carter"
 new_sun_cult.8.d:0 "The driftwood pirates of Drolakand, who hunt the eastern Divenhal, know stolen and jury-rigged boats cannot stand up to a fully protected trade flotilla. So, as beggars can't be choosers, they happily pounce on unexciting but accessible opportunities that gnolls might ignore.\n\nThe small dhow floating under the grey [GetMonth] sky was clearly one such target, with not a single cannon showing on deck. Seizing it went smoothly for the experienced pirates; not a single wound was taken, and the ambushed crew quickly surrendered. Fortunately, the hold was not completely empty; unfortunately, it seemed to have nothing of any value whatsoever. It was almost entirely taken up by a few crates of strange contraptions with unclear purpose (and similarly befuddling methods of use), and vast reams of paper dense with text. Still, with the approval of the Pirate-Akal, and the help of some gnollish contacts in Nathalaire, the crews' ransom might yield the gold that the ship did not. The day was done and the driftwood pirates headed back to Betelis, content with simple profits for a simple opportunity taken.\n\nOr so they thought.\n\nBecause among this crew was a very strange man, not at all like most others the Drolas had encountered. Prisoners are supposed to be swimming in a mix of shock and fear, but this 'Lucian Carter' was instead... incessantly trying to make conversation in a mixture of Common and broken Bulwari! In a friendly tone! Not even the threat of chains and gags dimmed the brightness of his face, as he asked prying questions of our faith in Surael, and dropped off-hand mentions of new discoveries in the west.\n\nThis was clearly a matter for the Pirate-Akal. And so upon arrival in Betelis, he was delivered to the Akal's hideout, and surely her forbidding demeanour would put the proper fear in this strange man. Surely."
 new_sun_cult.8.a:0 "What a peculiar man"
 new_sun_cult.9.t:0 "One Lucian Carter, One Peninsula, One God"
 new_sun_cult.9.d:0 "The Pirate-Akal did not inspire fear in Lucian Carter. Indeed, the inspiration seemed to have gone the other way — after a brief conversation in public, the Pirate-Akal pulled him into a smaller room. An hour or so later, she ordered a few of the strange objects captured with the ship brought in. And two hours — and a demonstration of a small object which shone piercing, directed, light — Lucian Carter had been announced as her new chief advisor.\n\nBut the Drolas are not greedy like the Brasanni, no, what one family member owns every family member owns. And so Lucian Carter soon found himself passed from cousin to cousin, sister to aunt, mother to daughter — and to each, teaching the use of common, basic arithmetic, the use of various small inventions. All intermixed, of course, with lessons about a new God, the only God, of whom Surael and all the others who perished long ago are merely a fragment. A chained god, a betrayed god, now released to guide us all.\n\nLucian Carter has proved a popular man in the Drolas peninsula, and even received leave to invite some comrades from Anbenncost to join him. New schools and hospitals have been built under his direction (the funds from ransoming his crew paid for the first). His teachings have proven popular to the Drolas, long a backwater of Bulwar, and the region has flourished under the Ravelian One God after being seemingly all-but-ignored by Surael. Ravelianism has landed in Bulwar, where it goes next, only Surael — or perhaps The Fragment — knows."
 new_sun_cult.9.a:0 "Leave him be"
 new_sun_cult.9.b:0 "Expel him and bring his followers back into the Light."

 #Bulwar under threat
 new_sun_cult.49.t:0 "The Decades of Devastation"
 new_sun_cult.49.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe past few decades have taken a heavy toll on the sun elven states in Bahar. We have been plagued with famine and infighting, then goblins from the mountains, heresy, and rebellion. It is not only destroying the land, it is destroying the humans’ trust in us.\n\n“How could Surael’s Chosen not have stopped this?” voices cry, if far and few between. “They have been too busy fighting each other for claims and wealth, they ignore our suffering!”\n\nWe realize now that our infighting was foolish in the face of the disasters happening around us. Our brash confidence has nearly proven our undoing. This cannot continue, the people must have absolute faith in us so that we might lead them to Surael’s Light.\n\nWe will have to find ways to counteract the atrocities of these past decades of war and hunger, such that the light shines on Bahar’s bright future ahead and not its gloomy past."
 new_sun_cult.49.a:0 "Surael willing, we will get ahead of this."
 new_sun_cult.50.t:0 "Bulwar Under Threat"
 new_sun_cult.50.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nBulwar has seen many threats in its past, but usually there was a greater power around to hold things together. Were the Sun Elven monarchies and human city-states united as one, the constant raids from harpies in the north and gnolls in the south and east would have faced a solid body of force, rather than our individual armies, scattered about territories and vulnerable to being picked off.\n\nOur people cry: ‘They have barely even been seen since these disasters began’. It is a shameful truth that we did too little to stop all this. We stayed in our palaces, focusing on our own affairs and the worship of Surael, confident that our armies and priests would handle the situation.\n\nThat was not the case, and these large incursions into our lands have worn us all down and left us weakened. If we do not act now to repel these monsters or stabilize our country, then it will not matter which of us is truly chosen by Surael to restore the Phoenix Empire — there won’t be any of us left to try."
 new_sun_cult.50.a:0 "The light must shine bright in [Root.GetName], and the darkness be banished!"
 new_sun_cult.51.t:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s Speech"
 new_sun_cult.51.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe plan is clear: our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will make a speech to the people, with couriers to send the message to all corners of our nation. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will promise to improve the lives of the people and ensure their safety, as is [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] duty as one of Surael’s Chosen. The people gaze up in wonder but also in agitation — things are getting very bad in Bulwar, and they need something to grasp onto in hope.\n\nDartaxes’ unquelled rebellion has caused many with little reason to question their faith in us to stir and rise up with thoughts of the old ways (and the human-run kingdoms that saw the Age of Monsters come). We have even heard whispers of vile heresy: that we are usurpers, and must be removed by any means necessary. Our administration is woefully unequipped to handle this dissent and the more the people are mishandled by crude actions, the more of them join these causes.\n\nBeyond our borders, the monsters press ever closer, raids striking ever further. Our military has suffered loss after loss and the people fear that soon it will not be the reasonable Sun Elves that they rebel against, but the demon-worshipping gnolls, or the man-stealing harpies, or the savage goblins from the mountains.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will make a pledge to the people to end this instability and push back the invaders! All we need now is to figure out where to start and how to go about all this."
 new_sun_cult.51.a:0 "Pledge to restore order in the realm before §Y10 years§! have passed."
 new_sun_cult.52.t:0 "Reform the Administration"
 new_sun_cult.52.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWith our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s promise made, we must immediately begin making good on it and stabilizing [Root.GetName]. There are two major areas we can focus on.\n\nFirst is the fact that many in our administration have become rather corrupt, money leaking out from dozens of holes and causing our work to stagnate. Fixing this would promote good practices, less extortion of humans, and more issues resolved without the need for our hand in the matter — and ensure every Sun Elf lives up to their responsibilities as the chosen of Surael.\n\nThe other option is to open new levels of administration and fill the positions with worthy human subjects. This would give them a voice, lower down on the chain, and hopefully reduce the negative impact of any corruption that trickles down that far. However, doing so will certainly anger our kin who are used to their patronage appointments.\n\nWe dare not attempt to do both at once, given our bureaucracy’s rustiness and our strained resources, but hopefully focusing our efforts on one of them will be enough to solve the problems."
 new_sun_cult.52.a:0 "Crack down on corrupt elven officials."
 new_sun_cult.52.b:0 "Increase productivity by integrating humans into the system."
 new_sun_cult.52.c:0 "Go back."
 new_sun_cult.53.t:0 "Corrupt Elves Are Resisting"
 new_sun_cult.53.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe corrupt officials in our administration are resisting the attempts to have their indulgent ways brought to heel. A group of the most influential have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seeking a meeting and have brought a small ‘token of appreciation’ to warm [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ear."
 new_sun_cult.53.a:0 "Well, it would be rude to refuse a gift..."
 new_sun_cult.53.b:0 "This is truly unacceptable, strip them of their rank and send them to jail!"
 new_sun_cult.54.t:0 "Social Mobility for Humans?"
 new_sun_cult.54.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nA group of prominent human citizens have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a complaint. Despite our efforts to crack down on the corruption which has been extorting them, they are concerned that in the future there will be no guarantee that these burdens remain gone.\n\nThey request that humans be allowed the social mobility to rise beyond their current means, if not to high ranks of government which obviously should remain the domain of Surael’s Chosen, still high enough to have the clout to avoid the effects of administrative malice and guarantee their people a place in the future."
 new_sun_cult.54.a:0 "Humans have a place, and it is not up here in the courts. Make no such promises."
 new_sun_cult.54.b:0 "Perhaps it is time we made some concessions to these humans."
 new_sun_cult.55.t:0 "Resilience to Change"
 new_sun_cult.55.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe current Sun Elven administration as a whole is not pleased with the idea of working with humans on a regular basis. Indeed, they find it distasteful that they must lower themselves so.\n\nThey implore us to revoke this latest decision and trust in centuries of success from the staff we already have. It won’t be long, they say, until the humans make a grave mistake somewhere that an elf couldn’t handled with their eyes closed."
 new_sun_cult.55.a:0 "Perhaps our kin do have the experience that humans lack."
 new_sun_cult.55.b:0 "We will continue on the path we chose. Give the humans a chance."
 new_sun_cult.56.t:0 "Human Advisors are Accumulating Mistakes"
 new_sun_cult.56.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nAs they warned us, the new human governors and advisors are making many mistakes which are costing them time and us resources. These mistakes are ones which an elf might have made on their first few days — centuries ago — our old guard is imploring us once again to just end this.\n\nBut we have set out on this path and turning back now would only destroy any chance we have left to prove to the humans that we should be leading them."
 new_sun_cult.56.a:0 "With time, they will probably be fine."
 new_sun_cult.56.b:0 "We should provide them better information and training, so it won't happen again."
 new_sun_cult.57.t:0 "Administrative Reforms Assessment"
 new_sun_cult.57.da:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nOur commitment to these reforms has finally paid off. The corruption in our courts has been dealt with and our human subjects feel they are no longer being exploited by our government. Their faith in us is one step closer to being restored."
 new_sun_cult.57.db:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWhile our systems of governance and our bureaucracies run smoother with far more accountability now, there is still much we could’ve done to improve. Alas, time, resources, and the general situation of things were not with us, and we can only do so much. Let us hope it was enough."
 new_sun_cult.57.dc:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nIn trying to reform our administration, we made many mistakes. We angered the Sun Elves by forcefully wrestling away their profitable exploitations, while the humans are more furious than ever at us for refusing to allow them to rise to fix the problems themselves. To make it worse, the half measures we enacted are themselves creating problems within the existing system. This will not be good."
 new_sun_cult.57.a:0 "Another step in the right direction!"
 new_sun_cult.57.b:0 "At least it's not as bad as before."
 new_sun_cult.57.c:0 "Stabilising the country will be harder now..."
 new_sun_cult.58.t:0 "The Grievances Sessions"
 new_sun_cult.58.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nOur advisors have come to us with an idea. A three-day period where any in the land can come to [Root.Capital.GetName] to present their grievances and complaints to the crown. We will have representative groups organized for each major section of our populace that have complaints and let them decide which to voice in during the Grievance Sessions.\n\nIdeally, we will be able to solve the peoples’ issues this way or at least find some solid compromises. Plus, it will help them feel as though they are participating in the affairs of the nation, and are heard by its ruler."
 new_sun_cult.58.a:0 "Authorise your subject to present their grievances to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 new_sun_cult.58.b:0 "Maybe later."
 new_sun_cult.59.t:0 "The Demands of the Mayors"
 new_sun_cult.59.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe first day of grievances sees the local mayors requesting more autonomy to deal with their cities and towns more effectively, without the need to bother the court for matters best handled from within anyway. Giving them more autonomy does present some risks, but it could be worth the reduced strain on our bureaucracy, even if it is only temporary."
 new_sun_cult.59.a:0 "Refuse. There is only one sun in the sky, and there must be only one court."
 new_sun_cult.59.b:0 "Allow it. We will put the freed-up scribes to better use."
 new_sun_cult.60.t:0 "The Demands of the Merchants"
 new_sun_cult.60.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe second day of grievances brings some of [Root.Capital.GetName]’s more successful merchants with a request to reduce the palace’s toll on imports and exports. They say that with the extra money they could make, they can hire more people and expand, thus encouraging the growth of the country’s economy. They promise that we will not miss the pittance the toll brings us, that the benefits shall trickle down to many others, and that every human community will prosper."
 new_sun_cult.60.a:0 "Refuse. Pittance or not, that money is ours."
 new_sun_cult.60.b:0 "Lower taxes? Cheeky humans, tax them even more!"
 new_sun_cult.60.c:0 "Allow it. They are right, richer humans means more taxable wealth anyway."
 new_sun_cult.61.t:0 "The Demands of the Peasantry"
 new_sun_cult.61.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe final day of grievances has arrived, the peasants’ day. They come with a desire for more basic rights to be granted to them. They claim that they must work all day, give such a large portion of their income to the crown, and are at risk of being drafted at a moment’s notice. They demand that they be given the same rights as those who live in the cities! If we do not grant them this, our advisors believe they may start rioting as there are already reports of violent groups of peasants gathering in some of the less-reputable drinking establishments in our realm."
 new_sun_cult.61.a:0 "Refuse. The sun does not fear a spot of rain, nor do we fear their tantrum."
 new_sun_cult.61.b:0 "Allow it. We are trying to win these people over, not turn them away."
 new_sun_cult.62.t:0 "End of the Grievances Sessions"
 new_sun_cult.62.da:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWith the final day of grievances over we have had to immediately cancel all further attempts to make this a regular occurrence. Most of those sessions were just humans whining about how unfair life is and then having to be thrown out by the guards for violent behaviour. This was a terrible idea."
 new_sun_cult.62.db:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWhile some left upset, for the most part those who came to the Grievance Sessions were at least satisfied with the result they got. This could certainly be made to work in the future and with a little time, perhaps we can make the lives of all citizens of our nation a little brighter."
 new_sun_cult.62.dc:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nSurael says be generous and always look to provide joy in the hearts of others in order to combat the Darkness. It is with this mindset that we approached these Grievance Sessions, and the result was overwhelmingly positive. Everyone left with at least a satisfying compromise, and we held nothing back in our efforts to help them all with their problems. Hopefully, the peoples’ faith in us has been restored a little more."
 new_sun_cult.62.a:0 "Damned humans! Always so greedy!"
 new_sun_cult.62.b:0 "At least it is a start. The people are beginning to speak fondly of us again."
 new_sun_cult.62.c:0 "This success is cause for a celebration! Perhaps we should declare a holiday?"
 new_sun_cult.63.t:0 "Appease your Vassals"
 new_sun_cult.63.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nOur human vassals must be appeased if we are to be able to count on their support in stabilizing the nation. At the moment we demand levies and a tax from them in exchange for our direct protection. Perhaps we should ease one of these burdens? Or perhaps it would be better to simply remind them that we are Surael’s Chosen, and hope they understand we can direct these resources better than they can."
 new_sun_cult.63.a:0 "Lower the tax. They need their money more than we do."
 new_sun_cult.63.b:0 "Lower the levy, their soldiers can be used to protect their own lands."
 new_sun_cult.63.c:0 "Prepare some propaganda, to remind them of our status as the Chosen."
 new_sun_cult.63.e:0 "Go Back."
 new_sun_cult.64.t:0 "Propaganda Campaign"
 new_sun_cult.64.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] wants §Yyou§!, to give your best efforts to Surael and His Chosen people. Only by working together and putting forth your best efforts in the endeavours of the Chosen can we hope to banish the Darkness and bask in His Light."
 new_sun_cult.64.a:0 "Start a propaganda campaign in [influenceable_vassal_1.GetName]"
 new_sun_cult.64.b:0 "Start a propaganda campaign in [influenceable_vassal_2.GetName]"
 new_sun_cult.64.c:0 "Start a propaganda campaign in [influenceable_vassal_3.GetName]"

 new_sun_cult.66.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Influenced Us"
 new_sun_cult.66.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWalking through the streets today, our advisors have noticed an unusually high number of people talking about the glories of Surael’s Chosen. Odd, weren’t they just questioning their rule the other day?"
 new_sun_cult.66.a:0 "The light can shine in peculiar ways, it seems..."
 new_sun_cult.67.t:0 "Propaganda in [From.GetName] Over"
 new_sun_cult.67.da:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nOur efforts to sway the populace of [From.GetName] have been effective. They remember now why they need to send us so much in the way of taxes and soldiers. It takes a lot of resources to keep the Darkness at bay."
 new_sun_cult.67.db:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nOur efforts to sway the populace of [From.GetName] have failed, either because they broke away from us or have been integrated into our realm."
 new_sun_cult.67.a:0 "Praise Surael!"
 new_sun_cult.67.b:0 "That's a shame."
 new_sun_cult.68.t:0 "Army Reforms"
 new_sun_cult.68.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nIf we are to uphold our promise and drive back the monsters, then we are going to need to reform our armies. They have not been nearly effective enough against the gnollish incursions and harpy raids.\n\nOur tactics have stagnated and become predictable over the past several centuries, our armies’ numbers are beginning to dwindle as more and more elves die in battle with few to replace them, and our training standards are lax. If we are to make do with what we have, then let us make certain that what we have will always be enough."
 new_sun_cult.68.a:0 "Let us begin the reforms."
 new_sun_cult.68.b:0 "Let us dedicate all our resources to these reforms."
 new_sun_cult.68.c:0 "Go back."
 new_sun_cult.69.t:0 "Reforming our Tactics"
 new_sun_cult.69.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nOur tactics have been passed down for several centuries now, ever since the days of Jaher’s Phoenix Legions. However, our armies are not identical to those legions and the times and technologies of war have changed a bit in the past three hundred years, it seems. New tactics will mean a fresh perspective on battles, and hopefully an effective one that will surprise our enemies.\n\nWe have three promising options. The old guard in our military say that defensive tactics would suit the terrain of our lands the best. Let the monsters shatter against our walls and shields.\n\nThe vanguard believes that to beat the monsters you must be faster than them. They propose reordering and training our armies to be deployable anywhere at a moment’s notice in smaller, better trained groups.\n\nThe last option is to rely on sheer volume of bodies on the field. With the humans rushing in a massed assault on the enemy, they will be too busy defending against those numbers to react to our more skilled elven troops coming in from the flanks."
 new_sun_cult.69.a:0 "Follow the old guard’s advice and focus on defensive tactics."
 new_sun_cult.69.b:0 "Follow the vanguard’s advice and focus on mobile warfare."
 new_sun_cult.69.c:0 "Rely on the humans and focus on mass assault."
 new_sun_cult.70.t:0 "Reforming our Troops’ Composition"
 new_sun_cult.70.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe composition of our armies has, like our tactics, been a sure and unchanging thing for centuries. But it is time we give them a second look.\n\nOur old guard believes that cavalry is still the way to go, a bright and shining sun elven cavalry charge can turn the tide of even the gloomiest of battles. Our vanguard believes that their format of smaller, specialized, and highly mobile squadrons could serve in all parts of the army, potentially giving us some very effective infantry. Then again, we could also just rely on stacking more and more humans into the front lines."
 new_sun_cult.70.a:0 "Follow the old guard advice and focus on cavalry."
 new_sun_cult.70.b:0 "Follow the vanguard advice and focus on specialised troops."
 new_sun_cult.70.c:0 "Rely on the humans and focus on mass infantry."
 new_sun_cult.71.t:0 "Reforming our Training"
 new_sun_cult.71.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nOur training regimens were designed long ago with the intent that the elves going through them would have years to perfect the drills and exercises, and rely on them for centuries. This is simply not the case anymore, and results in a very poor standard of quality amongst our human contingents.\n\nWe must change these training methods and we already have a few options from our advisors.

He was the rock that held the squabbling temples together across nations, from far eastern Azka-Sur to the docks of Re’uyel. There will be a great funeral procession for him through the streets of Irrliam and out to the nearby hills where a great pyre will be lit to send him to Surael, with a flame so large and tall, it will be visible from Brasan to Kalib.\n\nAlready, though, the ripples of his passing are being felt within the temples, and the air is filled with whispered questions of what will happen now that he is gone. So many aspects of the faith were seen to and administered by Taelarios himself that no single individual could ever truly fill his shoes. Of course, this meant that we held great sway and influence within the faith, and it would of course be best for all if it stayed that way.\n\nThankfully, our close ties to our human subjects, our allies across Bulwar, and that legacy of influence (prior to the power vacuum) give us a unique opportunity to find a solution. Hopefully, together, we will be able to sort out this potential crisis through debate in a great council of the members of the New Sun Cult.\n\nLed by Irrliam, of course."
 new_sun_cult.125.db:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nEven elves are mortal, though the other races so often forget this as generations will pass with the same rulers still holding firm to life and their position.

The lords and priests in Irrliam seem to be trying to organize some form of council to try and find solutions to this potential crisis that everyone can accept. We should start calling in favours now so that we might get some backing for our own positions in that council. Wouldn’t want to be left in the shade while others danced in the sun."

Now, we have only to decide how grand our own delegation should be. A large and splendid one could both show our support for the cause of unity and help to make us seem a powerful player in these matters.

After The Xhazobine, of course, things in Bulwar were nightmarish. Though she was eventually defeated, gnollish warlords would go on to ravage Bulwar in constant fights and raids for power and slaves.\n\nEverything changed when Jaherian ta'Diranhriá arrived in 1001 AA and began his liberation of Bulwar and the lands beyond.

They were allowed free reign on how to deal with these individuals, which usually meant great spectacles of execution, entirely outside of the Order of Juges’ remit.\n\nTheir second, lesser known, task was to convince other Sun Cult leaders to step in line with Taelarios, keeping him and Irrliam as a whole on top of the pile.

His conquests in the name of Surael (His proper name) would serve only to reinforce this belief.\n\nUpon his assassination in 1127 AA, the peoples’ faith in him and his was shaken — how could a divine being simply be assassinated like a common general? The priesthood made a proclamation then that Jaher’s divinity, as granted by Surael, had passed on to his kin upon his death, making sun elves the Chosen people of Surael and, as such, divine in their own right.\n\nThere have, of course, always been people who think otherwise. Some maintain that no one could truly embody Surael’s majesty and that only parts of his divinity are in the sun elves.

With Irrliam leading this council, most agreed with their decisions in all the debates, ensuring their wisdom will continue to guide us theologically and to settle disputes and issues in a way that satisfies all involved.\n\nAfter an entire night of festivities and games, the sun rises on the delegations leaving Medurubar to return to their respective nations, with priests and scribes carrying copies of the Debates’ minutes in tow, to spread the good news to their homes and peoples.\n\nThis marks the start of a new age for Bulwar, one of unity and strength through faith in Surael.

Others, however, are already preparing to leave the city, disgruntled by the lack of cooperation and consensus during the Council Debates.\n\nThough many things were decided upon, it was not as unanimous as many would have hoped, with plenty of disagreements and arguments over the decisions made. There will be enough support to ensure the results are enforced but not enough that we can truly say that Bulwar has been unified in the New Sun Cult faith.

The great fires we prepared to brighten up the night have gone unlit, the games and entertainment stands lay empty, the food and drinks untouched except by the poor and those who spent their day preparing it.\n\nThis night will not be a night of celebration, pushing back the Darkness. It will be a night of quiet contemplation on what went so wrong as to make Surael’s people so consumed by infighting and petty politics.

The Exemplars have made landfall in the continent’s south, what is now called the Dry Coast, and their position is solidified enough that they have sent back ships to request new colonists and soldiers for their mission.\n\nThis poses a problem for the Sun Elves of Bulwar. As the ruling class of the region, with already minimal numbers, especially in comparison to their human subjects, many Sun Elves are torn. The desire to return to the home of their ancestors is very strong, the knowledge that it is so underpopulated making the desire to return and make a new, elven, home for themselves even stronger. Some, though, do not wish to return. They see the lives they lead here in Bulwar as superior to any they might make in Aelantir, being worshipped as holy beings here and being no more than just another elf if they left. Those who wish to stay have been trying their best to dissuade their more eager kin from leaving and thus weakening the already tenuous position they hold in Bulwar.\n\nThen, there are the humans, who will no doubt see the mass exodus of their deified ruling class as a sign that Surael is abandoning them for the old home of the elves, his Chosen people.\n\nIn this time of uncertainty, everyone is turning to our ruler to seek [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] guidance.

Wealth and relics are streaming back by the boatload to be displayed by proud sun elven monarchs and wealthy human merchants.\n\nDespite all this, there is an abiding worry that the Chosen are abandoning their people in Bulwar. Though humans have risen to fill the gaps, and for the most part have done an adequate job, the concern that Surael’s Light will leave with the sun elves to Aelantir still has the common folk in a panic.\n\nMany human groups have taken to sending their own colonizers to Aelantir to join with the elves as they feel it is their duty to follow their masters. While this may be bringing wealth back to Bulwar, it does nothing for morale to see even the common folk abandoning their homes. Surael’s Light will be made to shine on every part of Aelantir at this rate, and the wealth it reveals from the shadows shall return here to Bulwar, but at what cost? Will His Light be spread there at the cost of dimming it here?"
 new_sun_cult.160.db:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWhile the people are still worried that some Chosen are abandoning them for a new life across the sea, they also see it as an opportunity for new lives themselves. Many merchants have set up very profitable enterprises in shipping supplies to the colonies and trading it for the wealth and exotic goods found there. Ships are cheaper than ever as the dockyards are always churning out new vessels to replace those lost or to swell the merchant fleets that travel to and from the west.\n\nThe Lost Continent does, however, present the issue of an easy alternative to those who are unhappy with their nation’s rule, disgruntled soldiers who cannot advance or peasants who have saved enough to buy passage hoping to find cheaper land and lower taxes. All things under the sun have both good and bad within them, and these Aelantir expeditions seem to be no exception."
 new_sun_cult.160.dc:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nAelantir, the source of so many of our troubles. The people cannot help but see the Chosen’s leaving for the west as abandonment by both them and Surael, whose light shone through them. While we have prevented the main body of our elven populace from going west through rhetoric, promises, bribes, and other such means, there are still many holes left in our society by those who departed. Many humans have risen in status to fill these gaps, and we have sought to convince the doubters the departure of a handful of events is not a tragedy but a boon, allowing them to rise above what they would otherwise have been.\n\nThe adventuring companies are the only ones we have not been able to convince. They wish to set up other expeditions, certain that there is enough wealth to be found in Aelantir to buy a country, if only it could be found. But there simply aren’t enough ships to go around nor funds available for these journeys, and more and more, people are less willing to join in these journeys, preferring to stay, as we have suggested is right.

In Bulwar, the gift of magic is granted to the Chosen by Surael. If magic was needed, for whatever reason, by the common people, then an elf can be petitioned by the clergy to work said magic.\n\nArtifice, however, has given rise to a unique problem: if the common folk can suddenly perform magic through the means of artifice, then magic is no longer a gift given only to the Chosen, which will undermine our control and a major aspect of the divinity seen in us by the people. Magic is a privilege given to us by Surael himself, and us alone.\n\nBut the humans make a decent point. Artifice is not technically magic, at least not directly. We have convened a council of wise elders, mages, priests, and scientists, all elves of course, to determine the risks of artifice and analyze any potential benefits to allowing the people to make use of it. Until then, we need to remove the influence of artifice from the people. But how extreme should our measures be?"

Therefore, they say, artifice should be pursued, without a doubt, but only by the sun elves who will do so responsibly and with grace.\n\nThe proclamation the following day was met with mixed reactions. While the people were pleased that artifice would be making its way into their lives to their benefit, many were disgruntled by the news that only the elves would be allowed to pursue its development.

A master glassblower was entranced of the Ravelian whisperings that arrived in the city with Busilari merchants, and heard the God Fragment's truth that magic must be made accessible to all, and that the Day of Ashen Skies was the product of magic being stolen and hoarded, to heart. The implication was then obvious for the magic of his craft.\n\nWorking with the local Ravelian society, he wrote the method of Azanerdu Glass -- the admixture of gold salts at a precise point in the glass-forming process results in glass with that distinctive red shade -- into a manual, which was then distributed to Ravelian societies across Cannor and beyond.\n\nAzanerdu's secret has been forever lost, even if the city's name still bears an associated prestige.

 new_sun_cult.214.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nBefore Ravelianism was a faith, it was a philosophy, from which scholarly Ravelian societies sprang like weeds. An organization devoted to the pursuit of knowledge free of preconception and prior dogma, even before the God Fragment was discovered they were a source of tension in Cannor, and a source of new ideas.\n\nFrom the merchant community in [ravelian_province.GetName], one such Ravelian society has formed, a collection of scholars discussing the latest teachings of the One God, perusing texts borrowed from the library at Aqatbar, and infuriating many of [Root.GetName]'s theologians with their recently-published claims and hypotheses.\n\nIs the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] content with such an institution existing in the realm, and perhaps drawing followers to the Ravelian claims and beliefs? Or should we immediately muster some troops, and perhaps call in some inquisitors from Irrliam, to see this infestation crushed like a weed?"
 new_sun_cult.214.a:0 "Intriguing. Make sure I see their latest findings."

 new_sun_cult.215.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe Bulwari people are used to raids, whether in the form of marauding gnolls or shrieking harpies. They come from seemingly nowhere to smite the land like a curse, engage for a few hours or days in a spree of abduction and looting, and then leave burning buildings, shattered families, and a scarred village in their wake.\n\nThe events yesterday in [raided_province.GetName] has had similar consequences. Lives ended, buildings razed, the city scarred. But this was not the product of monsters, it was the work of Surael-worshipping citizens in the town, who claimed the local Ravelian Society was a font of The Darkness and needed to be purged with His light.\n\nThe wounded Ravelians (and the merchants whose trade with them was disrupted) are crying out for justice, and an investigation to bring the criminals before the Order of Judges. But the clergy are urging us to be gentle, with many silently (and a few vocally) agreeing that this was good and right in Surael's eyes. What says the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 new_sun_cult.215.a:0 "The criminals will see Surael's light, and His justice."

 new_sun_cult.216.t:0 "A Rising Star"
 new_sun_cult.216.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nHumanity was born in Bulwar, and ever since, countless millions have spent their lives working here under Surael's light. Most live lives of duty, diligence, making a meaningful contribution but one likely unknown beyond their farm or village. But a few are blessed by Surael with the capacity and luck to do more, to truly make an impact on [Root.GetName]. And one such individual has recently come to our attention.\n\nUnfortunately, he seems to already have found a calling -- as a Ravelian priest, in one of the Ravelian societies that has recently sprung up in [Root.GetName]. We could perhaps convince him to shrug off those black robes he now wears and lend his service to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but the priests insist he cannot shrug off the shadow in her soul that comes from adhering to the whispers of the false One God. And indeed, with a place at court he may convince others of his beliefs.\n\nAn invitation has been drafted to order him to [Root.Capital.GetName] and the court. It lays in front of [Root.Monarch.GetName] -- but so does a raging fireplace. What comes next?"
 new_sun_cult.216.a:0 "Seal the invitation and send it on."
 new_sun_cult.216.b:0 "I wonder what colour the ink shall make as it burns?"
 new_sun_cult.217.t:0 "An Invitation from the Rectorate"
 new_sun_cult.217.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe message is read at night. There is no intent in that fact, it does not reflect any attempt to hide its contents from Surael's burning eye in the skies above. It is merely the consequence of the note's delivery, passed to the [Root.Monarch.GetName] at the end of a long day by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Ravelian advisor. So of course, it is read by candlelight and not sunlight, when [Root.Monarch.GetName] is alone and Surael's priests have all gone to bed. Just coincidence, happenstance.\n\nThe handwriting is elaborate, the paper clearly Konwell's best, but the text itself is short and succinct: "The High Rector, [Z97.Monarch.GetName], requests a delegation from [Root.GetName] attend [Z97.Monarch.GetHerHim] in [Z97.Capital.GetName]." A strange note, an unexpected one -- which leads to a strange possibility, but possibly one rife with potential.\n\nThere is no way the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] attend, the affairs of the state keep [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] busy (and the priests would call for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head). But if we wish to show the High Rector our favour, and that we are paying attention to the Ravelian cause, [Root.Heir.GetName] could lead an elaborate delegation. The trip would undoubtedly be good for our scion, a learning opportunity to train them for the day they take the throne. Alternatively, of course, we could just send a token delegation, without any [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] representation. Or should we do as those sleeping priests would undoubtedly suggest if they knew of the affairs transpiring here, and simply discard the letter and forget the High Rector's invitation?"
 new_sun_cult.217.a:0 "Send [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] accompanied by the most amazing delegation seen in recent memories!"

 new_sun_cult.218.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe delegation arrived at [Z97.Capital.GetName] and assumed it would be akin to any diplomatic affair with another state: the exchange of pleasantries, perhaps some boring meetings, a ball or two if you're lucky. They were wrong, deeply wrong.\n\nInstead, a select few saw themselves blindfolded, led by a small group of Veridicals to a chamber ensconced in the Rectorate's bowels. When they opened their eyes, they were near-blinded by the bright and iridescent light swirling in front of them, shades of green and blue and colours that seemed to lay beyond what a human can see. Within the light, they could see little but the edges of a multi-faceted geometric shape, and yet they sensed the power and weight of the object in front of them. Undoubtedly, they were bearing witness to the God Fragment itself.\n\nAnd then the Fragment spoke. The last shard of the One God, the only god to have ever resided in Halann, reverberated in the room and in their ears and in their souls. What it said (as translated by the High Rector and the Veridicals, of course) our representatives are not willing to share, even after pressures subtle and not-so-subtle from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. But we can be certain that whatever the revaluation was, it was a weighty one, for they have one and all converted to Ravelianism, swearing that God is One and the God Fragment is the last remaining piece of that One God. Whispers of their words and this new-found faith has spread around the court like a wildfire, and undoubtedly percolating beyond as well. It is an honour, of course, that men of [Root.GetName] could witness such an event. But it might be a threat as well."

Undoubtedly, they were bearing witness to the God Fragment itself.\n\nSo they stood, and stared. And watched, and waited. And that was it. An impressive lightshow, but nothing more. Indeed, it could have been some complex enchantment spell, and they would not be able to know the difference. Eventually, they were ushered from the room, the Veridicals expression (sheepish? confused? frustrated?) hidden in their black robes' cowls.\n\nThe High Rector insisted that it was an honour even to gaze upon the Fragment, that who are we to question whether a God turns Its face towards us or not, that its will is not for us to understand. But the delegation returned having seen some of Ravelianism's most tightly-held truths -- and being disappointed with them."

He sacrificed himself to save us from the Day of Ashen Skies, surviving as the sun above even when all the other gods perished. He sent his incarnation Jaher to free Bulwar from monsters, and with Jaher's death that role passed to his chosen, the Sun Elves.\n\nThis is the truth of [Root.GetName], its [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and all its people. Where pockets of our realm have been lead astray we shall guide them back onto the sunlit path, where foreigners whisper lies we shall see them expelled (or hung).\n\nWhatever the God Fragment's nature, it is merely an artifact from Aelantir -- and it pales before the majesty of Surael's blazing beacon in the sky. It is that sun that has watched over Bulwar for millenia, given life to its plants and its people, and seen us thrive to this day. The selfsame light shall shine over us forevermore, illuminating [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s life and the path before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and blessing all [Root.GetName] with its splendour."
