 new_sun_cult.49.t:0 "The Decades of Devastation"
 new_sun_cult.49.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe past few decades have taken a heavy toll on the sun elven states in Bahar. We have been plagued with famine and infighting, then goblins from the mountains, heresy, and rebellion. It is not only destroying the land, it is destroying the humans’ trust in us.\n\n“How could Surael’s Chosen not have stopped this?” voices cry, if far and few between. “They have been too busy fighting each other for claims and wealth, they ignore our suffering!”\n\nWe realize now that our infighting was foolish in the face of the disasters happening around us. Our brash confidence has nearly proven our undoing. This cannot continue, the people must have absolute faith in us so that we might lead them to Surael’s Light.\n\nWe will have to find ways to counteract the atrocities of these past decades of war and hunger, such that the light shines on Bahar’s bright future ahead and not its gloomy past."

 new_sun_cult.50.t:0 "Bulwar Under Threat"
 new_sun_cult.50.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nBulwar has seen many threats in its past, but usually there was a greater power around to hold things together. Were the Sun Elven monarchies and human city-states united as one, the constant raids from harpies in the north and gnolls in the south and east would have faced a solid body of force, rather than our individual armies, scattered about territories and vulnerable to being picked off.\n\nOur people cry: ‘They have barely even been seen since these disasters began’. It is a shameful truth that we did too little to stop all this. We stayed in our palaces, focusing on our own affairs and the worship of Surael, confident that our armies and priests would handle the situation.\n\nThat was not the case, and these large incursions into our lands have worn us all down and left us weakened. If we do not act now to repel these monsters or stabilize our country, then it will not matter which of us is truly chosen by Surael to restore the Phoenix Empire — there won’t be any of us left to try."

 new_sun_cult.51.da:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe plan is clear: our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will make a speech to the people, with couriers to send the message to all corners of our nation. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will promise to improve the lives of the people and ensure their safety, as is [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] duty as one of Surael’s Chosen. The people gaze up in wonder but also in agitation — things are getting very bad in Bulwar, and they need something to grasp onto in hope.\n\nDartaxes’ unquelled rebellion has caused many with little reason to question their faith in us to stir and rise up with thoughts of the old ways (and the human-run kingdoms that saw the Age of Monsters come). We have even heard whispers of vile heresy: that we are usurpers, and must be removed by any means necessary. Our administration is woefully unequipped to handle this dissent and the more the people are mishandled by crude actions, the more of them join these causes.\n\nBeyond our borders, the monsters press ever closer, raids striking ever further. Our military has suffered loss after loss and the people fear that soon it will not be the reasonable Sun Elves that they rebel against, but the demon-worshipping gnolls, or the man-stealing harpies, or the savage goblins from the mountains.\n\nWe lack the resources to deal with both problems at the same time, we must choose a focus: stability or reconquest. There will be long term benefits to both, if we see them through, and success in one should present solutions to both of our major problems. Which shall be our promise to the people?"

The harpies who have always raided our lands grow bolder at our weakness and the goblins in Bahar now have a solid foothold from which to launch their raids and expand their territory. Our military has suffered loss after loss and the people fear that soon it will not be the brilliant Sun Elves that they rebel against, but the man-stealing harpies or the savage goblins from the mountains.\n\nWe must do something about our failed military, and quickly, before there is nothing left of it to fight back with."

 new_sun_cult.52.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWith our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s promise made, we must immediately begin making good on it and stabilizing [Root.GetName]. There are two major areas we can focus on.\n\nFirst is the fact that many in our administration have become rather corrupt, money leaking out from dozens of holes and causing our work to stagnate. Fixing this would promote good practices, less extortion of humans, and more issues resolved without the need for our hand in the matter — and ensure every Sun Elf lives up to their responsibilities as the chosen of Surael.\n\nThe other option is to open new levels of administration and fill the positions with worthy human subjects. This would give them a voice, lower down on the chain, and hopefully reduce the negative impact of any corruption that trickles down that far. However, doing so will certainly anger our kin who are used to their patronage appointments.\n\nWe dare not attempt to do both at once, given our bureaucracy’s rustiness and our strained resources, but hopefully focusing our efforts on one of them will be enough to solve the problems."

 new_sun_cult.53.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe corrupt officials in our administration are resisting the attempts to have their indulgent ways brought to heel. A group of the most influential have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seeking a meeting and have brought a small ‘token of appreciation’ to warm [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ear."
 new_sun_cult.53.a:0 "Well, it would be rude to refuse a gift..."
 new_sun_cult.53.b:0 "This is truly unacceptable, strip them of their rank and send them to jail!"
 new_sun_cult.54.t:0 "Social Mobility for Humans?"
 new_sun_cult.54.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nA group of prominent human citizens have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a complaint. Despite our efforts to crack down on the corruption which has been extorting them, they are concerned that in the future there will be no guarantee that these burdens remain gone.\n\nThey request that humans be allowed the social mobility to rise beyond their current means, if not to high ranks of government which obviously should remain the domain of Surael’s Chosen, still high enough to have the clout to avoid the effects of administrative malice and guarantee their people a place in the future."
 new_sun_cult.54.a:0 "Humans have a place, and it is not up here in the courts. Make no such promises."
 new_sun_cult.54.b:0 "Perhaps it is time we made some concessions to these humans."
 new_sun_cult.55.t:0 "Resilience to Change"
 new_sun_cult.55.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe current Sun Elven administration as a whole is not pleased with the idea of working with humans on a regular basis. Indeed, they find it distasteful that they must lower themselves so.\n\nThey implore us to revoke this latest decision and trust in centuries of success from the staff we already have. It won’t be long, they say, until the humans make a grave mistake somewhere that an elf couldn’t handled with their eyes closed."
 new_sun_cult.55.a:0 "Perhaps our kin do have the experience that humans lack."
 new_sun_cult.55.b:0 "We will continue on the path we chose. Give the humans a chance."
 new_sun_cult.56.t:0 "Human Advisors are Accumulating Mistakes"
 new_sun_cult.56.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nAs they warned us, the new human governors and advisors are making many mistakes which are costing them time and us resources. These mistakes are ones which an elf might have made on their first few days — centuries ago — our old guard is imploring us once again to just end this.\n\nBut we have set out on this path and turning back now would only destroy any chance we have left to prove to the humans that we should be leading them."
 new_sun_cult.56.a:0 "With time, they will probably be fine."
 new_sun_cult.56.b:0 "We should provide them better information and training, so it won't happen again."
 new_sun_cult.57.t:0 "Administrative Reforms Assessment"
 new_sun_cult.57.da:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nOur commitment to these reforms has finally paid off. The corruption in our courts has been dealt with and our human subjects feel they are no longer being exploited by our government. Their faith in us is one step closer to being restored."
 new_sun_cult.57.db:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWhile our systems of governance and our bureaucracies run smoother with far more accountability now, there is still much we could’ve done to improve. Alas, time, resources, and the general situation of things were not with us, and we can only do so much. Let us hope it was enough."
 new_sun_cult.57.dc:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nIn trying to reform our administration, we made many mistakes. We angered the Sun Elves by forcefully wrestling away their profitable exploitations, while the humans are more furious than ever at us for refusing to allow them to rise to fix the problems themselves. To make it worse, the half measures we enacted are themselves creating problems within the existing system. This will not be good."
 new_sun_cult.57.a:0 "Another step in the right direction!"
 new_sun_cult.57.b:0 "At least it's not as bad as before."
 new_sun_cult.57.c:0 "Stabilising the country will be harder now..."
 new_sun_cult.58.t:0 "The Grievances Sessions"
 new_sun_cult.58.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nOur advisors have come to us with an idea. A three-day period where any in the land can come to [Root.Capital.GetName] to present their grievances and complaints to the crown. We will have representative groups organized for each major section of our populace that have complaints and let them decide which to voice in during the Grievance Sessions.\n\nIdeally, we will be able to solve the peoples’ issues this way or at least find some solid compromises. Plus, it will help them feel as though they are participating in the affairs of the nation, and are heard by its ruler."
 new_sun_cult.58.a:0 "Authorise your subject to present their grievances to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 new_sun_cult.58.b:0 "Maybe later."
 new_sun_cult.59.t:0 "The Demands of the Mayors"
 new_sun_cult.59.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe first day of grievances sees the local mayors requesting more autonomy to deal with their cities and towns more effectively, without the need to bother the court for matters best handled from within anyway. Giving them more autonomy does present some risks, but it could be worth the reduced strain on our bureaucracy, even if it is only temporary."
 new_sun_cult.59.a:0 "Refuse. There is only one sun in the sky, and there must be only one court."
 new_sun_cult.59.b:0 "Allow it. We will put the freed-up scribes to better use."
 new_sun_cult.60.t:0 "The Demands of the Merchants"
 new_sun_cult.60.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe second day of grievances brings some of [Root.Capital.GetName]’s more successful merchants with a request to reduce the palace’s toll on imports and exports. They say that with the extra money they could make, they can hire more people and expand, thus encouraging the growth of the country’s economy. They promise that we will not miss the pittance the toll brings us, that the benefits shall trickle down to many others, and that every human community will prosper."
 new_sun_cult.60.a:0 "Refuse. Pittance or not, that money is ours."
 new_sun_cult.60.b:0 "Lower taxes? Cheeky humans, tax them even more!"
 new_sun_cult.60.c:0 "Allow it. They are right, richer humans means more taxable wealth anyway."
 new_sun_cult.61.t:0 "The Demands of the Peasantry"
 new_sun_cult.61.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe final day of grievances has arrived, the peasants’ day. They come with a desire for more basic rights to be granted to them. They claim that they must work all day, give such a large portion of their income to the crown, and are at risk of being drafted at a moment’s notice. They demand that they be given the same rights as those who live in the cities! If we do not grant them this, our advisors believe they may start rioting as there are already reports of violent groups of peasants gathering in some of the less-reputable drinking establishments in our realm."
 new_sun_cult.61.a:0 "Refuse. The sun does not fear a spot of rain, nor do we fear their tantrum."
 new_sun_cult.61.b:0 "Allow it. We are trying to win these people over, not turn them away."
 new_sun_cult.62.t:0 "End of the Grievances Sessions"
 new_sun_cult.62.da:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWith the final day of grievances over we have had to immediately cancel all further attempts to make this a regular occurrence. Most of those sessions were just humans whining about how unfair life is and then having to be thrown out by the guards for violent behaviour. This was a terrible idea."
 new_sun_cult.62.db:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWhile some left upset, for the most part those who came to the Grievance Sessions were at least satisfied with the result they got. This could certainly be made to work in the future and with a little time, perhaps we can make the lives of all citizens of our nation a little brighter."
 new_sun_cult.62.dc:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nSurael says be generous and always look to provide joy in the hearts of others in order to combat the Darkness. It is with this mindset that we approached these Grievance Sessions, and the result was overwhelmingly positive. Everyone left with at least a satisfying compromise, and we held nothing back in our efforts to help them all with their problems. Hopefully, the peoples’ faith in us has been restored a little more."
 new_sun_cult.62.a:0 "Damned humans! Always so greedy!"
 new_sun_cult.62.b:0 "At least it is a start. The people are beginning to speak fondly of us again."
 new_sun_cult.62.c:0 "This success is cause for a celebration! Perhaps we should declare a holiday?"
 new_sun_cult.63.t:0 "Appease your Vassals"
 new_sun_cult.63.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nOur human vassals must be appeased if we are to be able to count on their support in stabilizing the nation. At the moment we demand levies and a tax from them in exchange for our direct protection. Perhaps we should ease one of these burdens? Or perhaps it would be better to simply remind them that we are Surael’s Chosen, and hope they understand we can direct these resources better than they can."
 new_sun_cult.63.a:0 "Lower the tax. They need their money more than we do."
 new_sun_cult.63.b:0 "Lower the levy, their soldiers can be used to protect their own lands."

However, our armies are not identical to those legions and the times and technologies of war have changed a bit in the past three hundred years, it seems. New tactics will mean a fresh perspective on battles, and hopefully an effective one that will surprise our enemies.\n\nWe have three promising options. The old guard in our military say that defensive tactics would suit the terrain of our lands the best. Let the monsters shatter against our walls and shields.\n\nThe vanguard believes that to beat the monsters you must be faster than them. They propose reordering and training our armies to be deployable anywhere at a moment’s notice in smaller, better trained groups.\n\nThe last option is to rely on sheer volume of bodies on the field.

But it is time we give them a second look.\n\nOur old guard believes that cavalry is still the way to go, a bright and shining sun elven cavalry charge can turn the tide of even the gloomiest of battles. Our vanguard believes that their format of smaller, specialized, and highly mobile squadrons could serve in all parts of the army, potentially giving us some very effective infantry.

We could rely on a quicker training program to get troops in the field, while letting our officers train much longer to ensure their skill. We could follow the vanguard’s method and train officers and soldiers together in small groups so they act in harmony.

 new_sun_cult.125.da:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nHundreds of bells tolling across the cities of Irrliam signal the death of our glorious King Taelarios Irrliazuir, unifier of the New Sun Cult faith and benevolent leader of our people. He was the rock that held the squabbling temples together across nations, from far eastern Azka-Sur to the docks of Re’uyel. There will be a great funeral procession for him through the streets of Irrliam and out to the nearby hills where a great pyre will be lit to send him to Surael, with a flame so large and tall, it will be visible from Brasan to Kalib.\n\nAlready, though, the ripples of his passing are being felt within the temples, and the air is filled with whispered questions of what will happen now that he is gone. So many aspects of the faith were seen to and administered by Taelarios himself that no single individual could ever truly fill his shoes. Of course, this meant that we held great sway and influence within the faith, and it would of course be best for all if it stayed that way.\n\nThankfully, our close ties to our human subjects, our allies across Bulwar, and that legacy of influence (prior to the power vacuum) give us a unique opportunity to find a solution. Hopefully, together, we will be able to sort out this potential crisis through debate in a great council of the members of the New Sun Cult.\n\nLed by Irrliam, of course."
 new_sun_cult.125.db:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nEven elves are mortal, though the other races so often forget this as generations will pass with the same rulers still holding firm to life and their position. Though it is not our ruler who has passed, the bells tolling from the temples all over Bulwar mark the death of another, Taelarios Irrliazuir, the sun elven king of Irrliam who pulled the disparaged pieces of the New Sun Cult back together after Jexis Jaherzuir’s assassination.\n\nThere are stirrings in the temples already as prominent figures scramble to prevent chaos — apparently many parts of the inner workings of the faith were seen to by Taelarios himself, and only he. The lords and priests in Irrliam seem to be trying to organize some form of council to try and find solutions to this potential crisis that everyone can accept. We should start calling in favours now so that we might get some backing for our own positions in that council. Wouldn’t want to be left in the shade while others danced in the sun."

Now, we have only to decide how grand our own delegation should be.

Some believe them divinely inspired rulers and chosen champions. There are also those who think that they are simply the ones chosen to lead us to Surael’s Light, not to carve the path or allow us to see it, but to guide us on it as equals.

After The Xhazobine, of course, things in Bulwar were nightmarish. Though she was eventually defeated, gnollish warlords would go on to ravage Bulwar in constant fights and raids for power and slaves.\n\nEverything changed when Jaherian ta'Diranhriá arrived in 1001 AA and began his liberation of Bulwar and the lands beyond.

They were allowed free reign on how to deal with these individuals, which usually meant great spectacles of execution, entirely outside of the Order of Juges’ remit.\n\nTheir second, lesser known, task was to convince other Sun Cult leaders to step in line with Taelarios, keeping him and Irrliam as a whole on top of the pile.

His conquests in the name of Surael (His proper name) would serve only to reinforce this belief.\n\nUpon his assassination in 1127 AA, the peoples’ faith in him and his was shaken — how could a divine being simply be assassinated like a common general? The priesthood made a proclamation then that Jaher’s divinity, as granted by Surael, had passed on to his kin upon his death, making sun elves the Chosen people of Surael and, as such, divine in their own right.\n\nThere have, of course, always been people who think otherwise. Some maintain that no one could truly embody Surael’s majesty and that only parts of his divinity are in the sun elves.

With Irrliam leading this council, most agreed with their decisions in all the debates, ensuring their wisdom will continue to guide us theologically and to settle disputes and issues in a way that satisfies all involved.\n\nAfter an entire night of festivities and games, the sun rises on the delegations leaving Medurubar to return to their respective nations, with priests and scribes carrying copies of the Debates’ minutes in tow, to spread the good news to their homes and peoples.\n\nThis marks the start of a new age for Bulwar, one of unity and strength through faith in Surael.

Wealth and relics are streaming back by the boatload to be displayed by proud sun elven monarchs and wealthy human merchants.\n\nDespite all this, there is an abiding worry that the Chosen are abandoning their people in Bulwar. Though humans have risen to fill the gaps, and for the most part have done an adequate job, the concern that Surael’s Light will leave with the sun elves to Aelantir still has the common folk in a panic.\n\nMany human groups have taken to sending their own colonizers to Aelantir to join with the elves as they feel it is their duty to follow their masters. While this may be bringing wealth back to Bulwar, it does nothing for morale to see even the common folk abandoning their homes. Surael’s Light will be made to shine on every part of Aelantir at this rate, and the wealth it reveals from the shadows shall return here to Bulwar, but at what cost? Will His Light be spread there at the cost of dimming it here?"
 new_sun_cult.160.db:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nWhile the people are still worried that some Chosen are abandoning them for a new life across the sea, they also see it as an opportunity for new lives themselves. Many merchants have set up very profitable enterprises in shipping supplies to the colonies and trading it for the wealth and exotic goods found there. Ships are cheaper than ever as the dockyards are always churning out new vessels to replace those lost or to swell the merchant fleets that travel to and from the west.\n\nThe Lost Continent does, however, present the issue of an easy alternative to those who are unhappy with their nation’s rule, disgruntled soldiers who cannot advance or peasants who have saved enough to buy passage hoping to find cheaper land and lower taxes. All things under the sun have both good and bad within them, and these Aelantir expeditions seem to be no exception."
 new_sun_cult.160.dc:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nAelantir, the source of so many of our troubles. The people cannot help but see the Chosen’s leaving for the west as abandonment by both them and Surael, whose light shone through them. While we have prevented the main body of our elven populace from going west through rhetoric, promises, bribes, and other such means, there are still many holes left in our society by those who departed. Many humans have risen in status to fill these gaps, and we have sought to convince th edoubters the departure of a handful of events is not a tragedy but a boon, allowing them to rise above what they would otherwise have been.\n\nThe adventuring companies are the only ones we have not been able to convince. They wish to set up other expeditions, certain that there is enough wealth to be found in Aelantir to buy a country, if only it could be found. But there simply aren’t enough ships to go around nor funds available for these journeys, and more and more, people are less willing to join in these journeys, preferring to stay, as we have suggested is right.
 new_sun_cult.160.a:0 "Aelantir awaits us! Praise the Sun!"

 new_sun_cult.190.d:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nArtificery, the growing discipline of combining magic and technology to create magic usable by those without the talent to manipulate it directly. In Bulwar, the gift of magic is granted to the Chosen by Surael. If magic was needed, for whatever reason, by the common people, then an elf can be petitioned by the clergy to work said magic.\n\nArtifice, however, has given rise to a unique problem: if the common folk can suddenly perform magic through the means of artifice, then magic is no longer a gift given only to the Chosen, which will undermine our control and a major aspect of the divinity seen in us by the people. Magic is a privilege given to us by Surael himself, and us alone.\n\nBut the humans make a decent point. Artifice is not technically magic, at least not directly. We have convened a council of wise elders, mages, priests, and scientists, all elves of course, to determine the risks of artifice and analyze any potential benefits to allowing the people to make use of it. Until then, we need to remove the influence of artifice from the people. But how extreme should our measures be?"

They say that the restriction of magic to the elven ruling class is a vital signifier of our status as Surael’s chosen. And despite the common folk claiming that artifice is not magic but something entirely different, the elves believe it could easily corrupt that vision, smearing the clear light of Surael in the peoples’ eyes. They wish to know [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s thoughts on the matter."

 new_sun_cult.202.t:0 "The Investigation Delivers its Verdict"
 new_sun_cult.202.da:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe investigators assigned to the task of determining the potential threat of artifice have concluded their studies. They have determined that artifice, though it involves magic, is a cruder form and so it would be fitting for the common folk to use without jeopardizing the position of the sun elven nobility’s control of magic. It can also, they say, be used to greatly enhance the lives and productivity of our people, eliminating many everyday issues and irritations, as well as eliminating potential dangers in the factories. All in all, they have determined that artifice should be open for anyone to make use of, human or elf.\n\nThe proclamation came the following day. The criers stated to the thousand gathered that artifice was a worthy pursuit for any who wished to pursue it and is, henceforth, officially endorsed by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The people cheered and immediately began celebrations, knowing that this would improve their lives tenfold and singing the praises of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and Surael!"
 new_sun_cult.202.db:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe investigators have concluded that artifice is a form of magic, cruder at the moment than traditional magic, but magic nonetheless. It does, however, have enormous potential to be refined and perfected, as magic has been for so many centuries. The ability to arm soldiers with devices of artifice in the fields could turn the tides of battle, incorporating it into the factories and crafting guilds could produce very high quality goods with very little effort or resources, even the clergy could use them to help heal and repair. Therefore, they say, artifice should be pursued, without a doubt, but only by the sun elves who will do so responsibly and with grace.\n\nThe proclamation the following day was met with mixed reactions. While the people were pleased that artifice would be making its way into their lives to their benefit, many were disgruntled by the news that only the elves would be allowed to pursue its development. The majority however, trust in the Chosen to do the right thing and to use this new discovery to help them and guide them ever towards the Light of Surael, as they have with magic before."
 new_sun_cult.202.dc:0 "£nsc_incident_banner£\nThe investigators have returned to us with many tales of near catastrophic explosions, magical radiation, rogue spell effects, and many more terrible stories throughout the course of their investigation. They have determined that artifice is both crude and dangerous, and can never be made equal to the established magical arts. Not only this, they also believe that if the common folk were to have these devices in their possession, they would undoubtedly wreak havoc throughout the nation and cause great destruction in their characteristic human  hastiness and foolish application of artificery.\n\nThere is no question in their minds, artificery as an art and as a concept must be banned forever from this nation, lest its destructive potential be accidentally or purposefully unleashed against us."
 new_sun_cult.202.a:0 "Now let's get some formal guilds set up for further study!"
 new_sun_cult.202.b:0 "We are already drafting plans for a new royal artificers guild!"
