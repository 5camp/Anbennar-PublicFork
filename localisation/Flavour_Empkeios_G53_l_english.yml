# The Chendhya Route
 empkeios_events.2101.t: "The Chendhya Route"
 empkeios_events.2101.d: "For centuries, wares, goods, but mostly slaves have flowed west through the Chendhya plains. This route is arduous and often times dangerous. Now a major trading power of Alecand, Empkeios, is offering us a deal. With our partnership, it should be possible to pacify the region, facilitate trade flow, and ultimately enrich us all. Should we accept?"
 empkeios_events.2101.a: "For a long, true, and lasting frienship!"
 empkeios_events.2101.att: "We will support their independence should they ever rise up against their overlord."

Our proposed deal, however, with the most prominent native group of the Chendhya, has been accepted and everything will change forever. With this partnership, it should we shall pacify the region, facilitate trade flow, and ultimately enrich us all. This is a momentous occasion!"
 empkeios_events.2102.a: "For a long, true, and lasting friendship!"
 empkeios_events.2102.att: "This partnership also means we can also count with their support in our potential independence war."
 empkeios_events.2102.btt: "A new alliance has been formed!"
# The Chendhya Route - NO
 empkeios_events.2103.t: "The Chendhya Route"
 empkeios_events.2103.d: "For centuries, wares, goods, but mostly slaves have flowed west through the Chendhya plains. This route is arduous and often times dangerous. Our proposed deal with the most prominent native group of the Chendhya, despite our best intentions, has been rejected. The route will remain harsh for every traveller and trader, and the region will remain divided. While clearly regrettable, we shall look forward and find new ways to pacify the region and ensure prosperity."
 empkeios_events.2103.a: "If they are not with us, they are against us."
 empkeios_events.2103.att: "We might get a chance to act again if we gain our independence."
# The Chendhya Route - A New Chance
 empkeios_events.2104.t: "The Chendhya Route: A New Chance"
 empkeios_events.2104.d: "When we tried a peaceful approach to facilitating trade and travel through the Chendhya, we were rejected. That proposal, however, was made years ago, when we were but a mere weak subject. Now, the dawn of a new era is upon us. Empkeios is now independent, and a new chance is presented to us to try again to make the Chendhya Route a new and prosperous trade avenue."
 empkeios_events.2104.a: "They rejected us once. Now we will make sure prosperity is not rejected."

# Sugar from Keyolion - Keyolion
 empkeios_events.5101.t: "The Slave Trade"
 empkeios_events.5101.d: "Empkeios has approached Keyolíon with a proposition that benefits both countries. Empkeios will provide Keyolíon with a steady supply of slaves for their plantations, then Keyolíon will then export the sugar to the Kheions and split some of the profit with Empkeios."
 empkeios_events.5101.a: "Let us do this."

# Overlords Intervene - Arpedifer
 empkeios_events.5104.t: "Opportunistic Nekheis"
 empkeios_events.5104.d: "Words reach us that our subject, Empkeios, has entered into an agreement with Keyolion in which the former supplies slaves to staff Keyolioni plantations. While on paper it seems beneficial for everyone, the reality is different. The Keyolioni have carefully designed the contract such that Empkeios receives a share of the produced trade, cutting on costs by subtracting from profits and sharing the wealth between the two Nekheis, essentially bypassing taxation. This has resulted in sugarcane tariff decrease over the last three years. This is in clear violation of our rights as their overlord. \n\nAs early as next week we can send a messenger declaring our new legislature, heavily sanctioning this behavior and establishing transparent laws that protect our trading interests."
 empkeios_events.5104.a: "We must intervene."
 empkeios_events.5104.b: "We will let them be."
# Overlords Intervene - Empkeios
 empkeios_events.5102.t: "Trade Agreement with Keyolíon - Intervention!"
 empkeios_events.5102.d: "Terrible news today, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A delegation from our overlord has docked this very morning on the port of Empkeios. They have come to inform us that, after striking a deal with Keyolíon's overlord, key parts of the trade agreement we had with our southern brethren are to be... reinterpreted. This intervention is to take place inmmediatly: the delegation is not open to negotiations. Keyolíon is expected to recieve the very same news soon. While parts of the deal are still in place, this is bound to severely reduce the potential benefits of the agreement."
 empkeios_events.5102.a: "Utterly unacceptable!"
# Overlodrs Intervene - Keyolion
 empkeios_events.5103.t: "The Slave Trade - Intervention!"
 empkeios_events.5103.d: "Terrible news today, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A delegation from our overlord has docked this very morning on the port of Keyolíon. They have come to inform us that, after striking a deal with Empkeios' overlord, key parts of the trade agreement we had with our northern brethren are to be... reinterpreted. This intervention is to take place inmmediatly: the delegation is not open to negotiations. Apparently, Empkeios has recieved the very same news already. While parts of the deal are still in place, this is bound to severely reduce the potential benefits of the agreement."
 empkeios_events.5103.a: "Utterly unacceptable!"

# Independence Plot - Keyolion
 empkeios_events.5201.t: "The Independence Plot"
 empkeios_events.5201.d: "The people of Empkeios, just like us, have been suffering under the rule of their overlord for too long. Our overlords intervening in our marvelous trade agreement seems to have been the last straw. They have approached us with a proposal: to fight together for our independence, against both our overlords."
 empkeios_events.5201.a: "As brothers, we shall fight together!"
 empkeios_events.5201.b: "We will fight alone."
 G53_keyo_empk_mission_completion_tt: "Declaring an independence war will mean also declaring war alongside §YEmpkeios§! against their overlord."
# Independence Plot - YES
 empkeios_events.5202.t: "The Independence Plot"
 empkeios_events.5202.d: "The delegation we have sent to our southern bethren, Keyolíon, has just returned, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They have accepted our proposal to fight together for our independence. We shall fight together, and we shall win together!"
 empkeios_events.5202.a: "United, we will fight as one!"
 G53_empk_keyo_mission_completion_tt: "Declaring an independence war will mean also declaring war alongside §YKeyolíon§! against their overlord."
# Independence Plot - NO
 empkeios_events.5203.t: "The Independence Plot"
 empkeios_events.5203.d: "The delegation we have sent to our southern bethren, Keyolíon, has just returned, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They have rejected our proposal to fight together for our independence. We will have to fight alone; yet every preparation possible has been made. We shall win our independence!"
 empkeios_events.5203.a: "Regradless, it is reggretable that we will not be counting with them."

# Independence war: Success
 empkeios_events.4302.t: "Independence War - Victory!"
 empkeios_events.4302.d: "The war is over, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We have won our independence! The overlords of both Empkeios and Keyolíon have been defeated, and we are now free to pursue our own destiny. We shall not forget the help of our southern brethren in this war, and we shall not forget the help we have given them. We are now free to pursue our own destiny, make the most of every deal, and make our nation prosper. And we find ourselves in an enviable position: the market for slaves is booming, and we have the largest slave market in the region along with one of the best harbours. The future is bright for us."
 empkeios_events.4302.a: "Freedom is ours, yet some are more free than others."
# Independence war: Defeat
 empkeios_events.4303.t: "Independence War - Defeat!"
 empkeios_events.4303.d: "The war is over, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Our struggle for independence has been a failure. We were crushed by the steel boots of our overlords; and despite the help we mustered from far and wide, it simply was not enough. Countless lives were lost in this heroic battle, entire families were destroyed, and our nation has been left in ruins. We are now at the mercy of our overlords, yet again. All the citizens of Empkeios weep for the fallen, and we shall never forget their sacrifice. Rather than back to step one, we are now back to step zero. New opportunities will have to be found, new webs of alliances will have to be plotted, and new armies to fight will have to be built if we are to ever embark on the rightful journey to independence again."
 empkeios_events.4303.a: "May the fallen rest in peace. May the living never forget."

# Up the Mteibas Valley - Already controlled
 empkeios_events.4401.t: "Up the Mteibas Valley"
 empkeios_events.4401.d: "The Continent's Inland Trade has multiple routes. While some were already being exploited by our skilled traders and diplomats, the closed Mteibas Valley remains hard to access and, more importantly, hard to cross for anyone coming from beyond it. This trade route is of utmost importance for the ports of Empkeios, and we have secured it!"
 empkeios_events.4401.a: "We rule!"
# Up the Mteibas Valley - Chain Start
 empkeios_events.4402.t: "Up the Mteibas Valley"
 empkeios_events.4402.d: "The Continent's Inland Trade has multiple routes. While some are already being exploited by our skilled traders and diplomats, the closed §YMteibas Valley§! remains hard to access and, more importantly, hard to cross for anyone coming from beyond it. This trade route is of utmost importance for the ports of Empkeios, and we must secure it.\n\nThe current rulers of the Mteibas Valley seem to have fallen a bit behind the times, and there clearly exists an opportunity to enter into a... collaboration agreement if we manage to push things the right way. To do so, our most clever diplomats have devised a strategy where, by attatching a mercenary company to our diplomatic §YDelegation§!, there will be no need for explicit threats. The offer will be presented; yet in the terrible and unwanted case that they refuse, the Lawarund Company may take matters into its own hands."
 empkeios_events.4402.a: "Brilliant. May the Delegation depart!"
# Up the Mteibas Valley - For Mteibhara
 empkeios_events.4403.t: "The Delegation from Empkeios"
 empkeios_events.4403.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have concerning news. At noon today, whole regiment has arrived at the doors of the walls of Mzhaara. They call themselves a §Y'Delegation'§!, whith strictly diplomatic objectives, and they bear the banners of §YEmpkeios§!; yet they hardly fool anyone. The comitee itself is composed by a set of diplomatic attachés, yes; but they are escorted by a whole regiment of soldiers. Our scouts have reported that this is but a part of the missive, a whole mercenary army seems to have camped just beyond the agreed border.\n\nDespite this all, the Delegation has not made any explicit threats. At least not yet. They have, however, presented a proposal to the rulers of Mteibhara: to enter into a collaboration agreement with §YEmpkeios§!. This, at first glance, seems to be a trading partnership to open the Mteibas Valley to the rest of the continent's trade. Nonetheless, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the bureocratic jargon clearly hides dangerous implications for the sovereignty of §YMteibhara§!.\n\nWe find ourselves between a rock and a hard place. Should we refuse, it is easy to guess what steps will the mercenary army take. Should we accept, we will be giving up our sovereignty. What shall we do?"
 empkeios_events.4403.a: "This is outrageous! We will not sell our independence!"
 empkeios_events.4403.att: "There is no knowing what §YEmpkeios§! will do when the news reaches them."
 empkeios_events.4403.b: "We will accept, but we will not be giving up our autonomy."
 empkeios_events.4403.btt: "§YMteibhara§! will become an autonomous vassal of §YEmpkeios§!."

Should we refuse, it is easy to guess what steps will the mercenary army take. Should we accept, we will be giving up control over §YMzhaara§. What shall we do?"
 empkeios_events.4404.a: "This is outrageous!"
 empkeios_events.4404.att: "§YEmpkeios§! will get permanent claims on the Mteibas Valley."

 empkeios_events.4405.d: "The Delegation to the Mteibas Valey has returned, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They have brought excellent news: the rulers of §YMteibhara§! have accepted our proposal. The Mteibas Valley is now open to the rest of the continent's trade, and we have secured a new trade route for our ports; and §YMteibhara§! itself, under our albeit indirect control.\n\nThe success of this Delegation also has settled some deep debates regarding the diplomatic policy to be followed in the future. The Lawarund Company has proven to be a very effective tool to achieve our goals, and this kind of strategy shall be further developed in upcomming missions."

Yet not all hope is lost. The fact that the Mteibas Valley will remain closed to the rest of the continent's trade is something we should exploit: if not with the power of words, it may be the time for spears.\n\nThe results brought upon by this Delegation also have settled some deep debates regarding the diplomatic policy to be followed in the future. The Lawarund Company has proven to be a very effective tool to achieve our goals, yet it has also proven to be a double-edged sword. Not fulfilling our threats may not only make us look weak, but also make our future threats less credible. Overall, this kind of strategy shall be further developed in upcomming missions."

 empkeios_events.4501.d: "With the boom of trade our continent has felt for the last decades, many governments, both Alecandi or Nekhei, have been holding long and thorough debates regarding customs and the dealing with goods from abroad. Some, led by the example of Ameion, lean to §PIsolationism§!, closing the doors to further trade benefits for us all.\n\nIt is our duty, as hardy seamen, as traders through and thorough, as defenders of our freedom, to keep the doors open to the world. Pursuing and ensuring that §PFree Trade§! policies are followed around the continent is of utmost importance. Riches from further than the eye can see await us.\n\nWe are now in a position of strength, and the crossroads of destiny are just in front of us. The preferred opinion of our states is to make use of this newfound strength. However, we can always let every other ruler of the region chose their way without our... friendly recommendations."
 empkeios_events.4501.a: "Dhorý diplomacy has worked us best so far. Stop having this continent closed!"
 empkeios_events.4501.att: "We will send an ultimatum to every ruler of the region to embrace §PFree Trade§! rules."

Some, led by the example of Ameion, lean to §PIsolationism§!; while the rising power, Empkeios, is leading the effort for open customs and §PFree Trade§!.\n\nThe latter has now issued an ultimatum to every other nation in our region. We can either fall in line, forcing our trade policy to be aligned with theirs for the foreseeable future, or we may face the consequences of not open our borders to their traders."

The fools in [From.GetName] decided to reject our ultimatum, deciding instead to side with §PIsolationism§!.\n\nFollowing our official diplomatic line, the Dhorý diplomatic policy, the next steps are crystal clear, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We have now an unique chance to teach them a lesson and make them fall in line. Yet, as the double-edge sword of Dhorý diplomacy goes, should we decide not to act, our international reputation would plummet.\n\nThere really are only two options to carry on with our threat: we either bring them to our sphere of influence, making them a vassal of any kind; or we make sure they are not a threat to our regional interests anymore by making sure they do not hold any province in the §YDevand§!.What shall we do, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
