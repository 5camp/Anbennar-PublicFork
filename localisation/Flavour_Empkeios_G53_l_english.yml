empkeios_events.2101.d: "For centuries, wares, goods, but mostly slaves have flowed west through the Chendhya plains. This route is arduous and often times dangerous. Now a major trading power of Alecand, Empkeios, is offering us a deal. With our partnership, it should be possible to pacify the region, facilitate trade flow, and ultimately enrich us all. Should we accept?"
empkeios_events.2101.a: "For a long, true, and lasting frienship!"

empkeios_events.2102.d: "For centuries, wares, goods, but mostly slaves have flowed west through the Chendhya plains. This route is arduous and often times dangerous. Our proposed deal, however, with the most prominent native group of the Chendhya, has been accepted and everything will change forever. With this partnership, it should we shall pacify the region, facilitate trade flow, and ultimately enrich us all. This is a momentous occasion!"

empkeios_events.2103.d: "For centuries, wares, goods, but mostly slaves have flowed west through the Chendhya plains. This route is arduous and often times dangerous. Our proposed deal with the most prominent native group of the Chendhya, despite our best intentions, has been rejected. The route will remain harsh for every traveller and trader, and the region will remain divided. While clearly regrettable, we shall look forward and find new ways to pacify the region and ensure prosperity."

empkeios_events.2104.t: "The Chendhya Route: A New Chance"
empkeios_events.2104.d: "When we tried a peaceful approach to facilitating trade and travel through the Chendhya, we were rejected. That proposal, however, was made years ago, when we were but a mere weak subject. Now, the dawn of a new era is upon us. Empkeios is now independent, and a new chance is presented to us to try again to make the Chendhya Route a new and prosperous trade avenue."
empkeios_events.2104.a: "They rejected us once. Now we will make sure prosperity is not rejected."
