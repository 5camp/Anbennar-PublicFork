 #Acolytes Interactions Events

 acolyte_interaction.1.d:0 "'To seek Reason, one must part with the Passions. See in war not tragedy, but the glory of tested minds.' -excerpt from the War Tablet\nWeep, ye pathetic souls who shy from battle! Hear the lamentations of cowards and babes! [Root.GetName] has begun to assemble able-bodied warriors behind the Acolyte's banner."
 acolyte_interaction.1.a:0 "There is much glory in blood!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.2.t:0 "Knowledge Sharing"
 acolyte_interaction.2.d:0 "'Whispered secrets are the currency of the Ascending Acolyte.' -excerpt from the Secret Book of the Darkened Sun\nThe esoteric obscura of the arcane arts often make for tantalizing secrets, jealously guarded by the powerful and ambitious. This makes it all the more remarkable that [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] have agreed to share their magical knowledge. What glories might this portend?"
 acolyte_interaction.2.a:0 "Taste the fruit of knowledge!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.3.t:0 "Experimental Success"
 acolyte_interaction.3.d:0 "'In ascending, the Acolyte hones each of the Three Aspects. Purify the soul and be reforged among the stars.' -excerpt from the Secret Book of the Darkened Sun\n[Root.GetName] understands that power comes from risk. There is no such thing as safe magic, and even the most powerful mages are easily hobbled by their fears. The arcane arts have rewarded the Acolyte's courage, granting a boon."
 acolyte_interaction.3.a:0 "Power is the ultimate reward."
 
 acolyte_interaction.4.t:0 "Experimental Failure"
 acolyte_interaction.4.d:0 "'In ascending, the Acolyte hones each of the Three Aspects, but beware! The Passions lay their traps, and the clouded mind is shunned by the chorus of Reason.' -excerpt from the Secret Book of the Darkened Sun\n[Root.GetName] understands that power comes from risk. There is no such thing as safe magic, and even the most powerful mages are easily hobbled by their fears. Unfortunately, the arcane arts have not served the Acolyte well in this case, leaving former wellsprings of power tainted and unusable."
 acolyte_interaction.4.a:0 "A temporary setback."
 
 acolyte_interaction.5.t:0 "In a Relationship"
 acolyte_interaction.5.d:0 "'The Dreamers traverse the grove, hand-in-hand. There they were found by the spirit of Creation, who saw in their love not the Passions but Beauty Ascendant.' -excerpt from Wisdom of the Magician's Grove\nTo be an Acolyte is to wander alone through the darkness, to fearlessly face the boundaries of knowledge armed with only one's own wit and determination. It is a lonely path, as no Acolyte can find peers among the wretched and pathetic weaklings. Fortunately, [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] have found one another and began an amorous partnership. One would be wise to remember that power often follows love..."
 acolyte_interaction.5.a:0 "A glorious union!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.6.t:0 "Breakup"
 acolyte_interaction.6.d:0 "'Creation and Negation, the Twin Forces, are at play in every moment and in every time. The Dreamers, visited once by Creation, were now met by Negation, the darker twin, who tore them asunder and birthed Beauty Descendant.' -excerpt from Wisdom of the Magician's Grove\nThe very air feels heavy with grief and the raindrops are as knives. Nature itself weeps in heartbreak for the dissolution of the romantic partnership between [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName]! However, all true disciples of the arcane know that pain and fury make for potent fuel indeed."
 acolyte_interaction.6.a:0 "The return of precious solitude."
 
 acolyte_interaction.7.t:0 "Incredible Ruler"
 acolyte_interaction.7.d:0 "'Neglect not the material world, but aid it in its ascension, and reunite it once more with the Universal Mind.' -excerpt from the Memoirs of an Arcane Steward\n[Root.GetName] is a model of competent governance. All sing the Acolyte's praises, and all recognize them as the rightful sovereign of this land. Power justifies itself by being applied to the benefit of the realm, and by being applied to punish those enemies, foreign or domestic, who would undermine the nation."
 acolyte_interaction.7.a:0 "Love can be as useful as fear."
 
 acolyte_interaction.8.t:0 "Absolute Debauchery"
 acolyte_interaction.8.d:0 "'The Seventh Initiate was marked as the Fool on his fifth night in the City of Reason, for he was found amidst the Passions rather than in quiet contemplation.' -excerpt from The Failure of the Seventh Initiate\n[Root.GetName] has gained a reputation for spending too many nights enjoying the carnal pleasures of the flesh and reveling in the opportunities for merry-making provided by the arcane arts. These distracts have allowed the apparatus of the state to fall into considerable disrepair, and the people have begun to plot against [Root.GetName]. Even the other Acolytes whisper mockingly. Can such humiliation truly be borne?"
 acolyte_interaction.8.a:0 "These insects shall be crushed in due course."
 
 acolyte_interaction.9.t:0 "The Horde"
 acolyte_interaction.9.d:0 "'If you have managed to defuse the hexes guarding this text, you are worthy to receive the knowledge held within. If you have not, my fervent recommendation is that you begin your funerary preparations posthaste, as you have little time. I shall be your guide to the secrets of the Final Gates, and in so doing I shall reveal all the many lies you have been told. The very act of your reading this book shall be a glorious event in the history of this world. Come, then. Claim your legacy.' -excerpt from the Secret History of Anti-Illumination\nTo a mortal, death is an impenetrable barrier. Their impotent protestations do not slow it, and the reaper's scythe unerringly comes to claim the souls of their loved ones. But to [Root.GetName], a legendary necromancer, death is only the beginning. The great harvest has only just begun, and an army of the undead rises under the clouds of a gathering storm."
 acolyte_interaction.9.a:0 "The end to mortality dawns!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.10.t:0 "Unnatural Beauty"
 acolyte_interaction.10.d:0 "'The Fool is seen, the Sage is beheld.' -excerpt from Wisdom of the Magician's Grove\n[Root.GetName] is a legendary enchanter and has used this ability to improve their own appearance. Such unnatural and unearthly beauty seems almost eerie and off-putting to the common folk, but comes across as absolutely irresistible to the refined tastes of Acolytes of the opposite sex."
 acolyte_interaction.10.a:0 "Behold beauty unchained!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.11.t:0 "A Tribulation of Gold"
 acolyte_interaction.11.d:0 "'It is often wrongly believed that the ultimate goal of alchemy is transmutation into gold, as this is trivial for a master of transmutation. It is, however, the most profitable goal of alchemy.' -excerpt from the Codex Alchemica.\n[Root.GetName] is a legendary transmutation mage. Breaking one of the norms of the Black Demesne's monetary policy, they have transmuted massive amounts of raw material directly into gold. This has brought them considerable wealth at the expense of causing massive inflation across the Demesne."
 acolyte_interaction.11.a:0 "Curses!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.12.t:0 "Nurturing A New Body"
 acolyte_interaction.12.d:0 "'O Ascending Star! May your death be cause for celebration, for your rebirth is at hand!' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\nThe body is such a fragile thing. Delicate, and prone to failure, it simply cannot be trusted to last an Acolyte for eternity. Nevertheless, the soul must be chained to one of these vessels of flesh to continue affecting the physical world, and so [Root.GetName] has begun the process of growing an empty shell to move into upon their death."
 acolyte_interaction.12.a:0 "A new face for the same old Acolyte."
 
 acolyte_interaction.13.t:0 "Research Stolen"
 acolyte_interaction.13.d:0 "'Be unbound, brothers. Be not distracted by the consideration of the chattering creatures. All that is known is your birthright.' -excerpt from the Black Tablet of Skeljor\n[Root.GetName]'s agents have dared to steal the magical research of another Acolyte! Though this cannot be definitively proven, all available evidence points to the same culprit. They will no doubt profit handsomely from this research. Fortune does favor the bold, after all."
 acolyte_interaction.13.a:0 "Delectable secrets..."
 
 acolyte_interaction.14.t:0 "Magical Supremacy"
 acolyte_interaction.14.d:0 "'O Universal Mind, call forth the Chorus of Reason to bear witness to your servant, the Acolyte Ascendant, the Stellar Zenith, master of the Twin Forces, bearer of the Thousand Secrets.' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\nThere is no school of magic that [Root.GetName] has not mastered. A true Acolyte of the esoteric and arcane, their reputation precedes them in any hall dedicated to the pursuit of mystical truths. It is possible they are the single most powerful being on the planet. The Acolyte's glory knows no bounds in the Demesne, and it is difficult for even other Acolytes to seriously challenge their claim to absolute supremacy."
 acolyte_interaction.14.a:0 "A god walks among us!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.15.t:0 "Exchange of Pleasantries"
 acolyte_interaction.15.d:0 "'Acolyte! A Seeker stands before thee. This one bears the Mark, and this one has heard Creation's voice. Beckon, then, your fellow traveler, and may we entreat the Universal Mind for its blessings.'\n[Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] performed the Rite of Peerage, a mystical rite acknowledging another mage that has been used to show respect between Acolytes for many years. Though the rite itself has little practical effect, it signals to the rest of the Demesne that the Acolytes and their respective realms have grown closer."
 acolyte_interaction.15.a:0 "I greet thee, Seeker."
 
 acolyte_interaction.16.t:0 "Bond Forged in Silence"
 acolyte_interaction.16.d:0 "'Brothers! Stand with me in the assembly of souls! Lend me your strength, and beckon home the whims of Creation and Negation!' -excerpt from the Tablet of Final Contemplation\nMagic is full of unsolved problems -- some, like the Dark Matrices, may even be unsolvable. But more common than the unsolvable problems are those which are simply too difficult for even an Acolyte to tackle alone. Two working together, however... such a team is not easily dissuaded from the acquisition of arcane knowledge. Such is the case for [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName]."
 acolyte_interaction.16.a:0 "Ah, wisdom's fruit."
 
 acolyte_interaction.17.t:0 "Secret Research"
 acolyte_interaction.17.d:0 "'In quietude the mind ascends, seeking fragments of union with the universal intellect who all creation obeys. This is the first stone laid on the path to the Universal Mind. Acolyte, listen for it in the quiet moments, where all melts away before the thrumming of Creation's voice.' -excerpt from the Record of Ascension\n[Root.GetName] has refused all visitors for several days now, having locked themselves in a laboratory some time ago. This is entirely expected, and the ministers of state know that such activities can only mean one thing: the Acolyte's secret research nears a new breakthrough."
 acolyte_interaction.17.a:0 "The precipice of glory!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.18.t:0 "Secret Research Succeeds"
 acolyte_interaction.18.d:0 "'In quietude the mind ascends, seeking fragments of union with the universal intellect who all creation obeys. Behold the ascending star, whose form is forged in the Heavens! The chorus of Reason acclaims the descent of knowledge. Acolyte, claim the Stars!' -excerpt from the Record of Ascension\n[Root.GetName] has emerged from scholastic seclusion to lay out a fully-proven theorem demonstrating some finer point of mystical obscura before their closest advisors. This period of research has undoubtedly been a success."
 acolyte_interaction.18.a:0 "Eureka!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.19.t:0 "Secret Research Fails"
 acolyte_interaction.19.d:0 "'In quietude the mind ascends, seeking fragments of union with the universal intellect who all creation obeys. But the Universal Mind is fickle, and rewards only those of pure dedication for whom all concerns have melted away.' -excerpt from the Record of Ascension\n[Root.GetName] has emerged, sullen, from scholastic seclusion. An incomplete and unproven theorem is the only thing they have to show for this period of research. Though this experience may teach them valuable lessons for the years to come, it is a bitter disappointment in the present moment."
 acolyte_interaction.19.a:0 "Alas, such is the burden of knowledge."
 
 acolyte_interaction.20.t:0 "Military Cooperation"
 acolyte_interaction.20.d:0 "'Through blood is iron consecrated, and through blood is union forged. The magician who dwells at the base of the mountain climbs only through brotherhood and accord. Seek in every act a partner whose ties are built on the forge of flesh.' -excerpt from Contemplations of the Mystic Blade\n[Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] have formalized a deal that will provide for cooperation, information sharing, and strategic partnership between the militaries of the two Acolytes."
 acolyte_interaction.20.a:0 "Such things are here today, gone tomorrow."
 
 acolyte_interaction.21.t:0 "Great Orator"
 acolyte_interaction.21.d:0 "'The thrice-blessed magician is he who masters the magic of men's hearts, who speaks into their soul the burning fire of will.' -excerpt from Wisdom of the Magician's Grove\nEach Acolyte is different, and they each have unique strengths and weaknesses. For [Root.GetName], there can be no doubt that an incredible gift for oratory is the primary strength. Delivering fiery speeches promising glory, purpose, and prosperity, one wonders just how far the Acolyte can get on words alone."
 acolyte_interaction.21.a:0 "A remarkable gift."
 
 acolyte_interaction.22.t:0 "Rite of Greeting Goes Well"
 acolyte_interaction.22.d:0 "'Purify yourself in rite and ritual, to see as marked out before you those who carry also the blessings of the Universal Mind.' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\nA delegation from [country.GetName]'s realm arrived at the court of [Root.GetName] and participated in the Rite of Greeting, a traditional rite of the Black Demesne in which visitors from another court acknowledge the supremacy of the Acolyte in their own domain, and in return receive promises of protection. Fortunately for the visitors, they performed their duties admirably and have secured a temporary improvement in the relations between [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName]."
 acolyte_interaction.22.a:0 "We are bound together by tradition."
 
 acolyte_interaction.23.t:0 "Rite of Greeting Goes Poorly"
 acolyte_interaction.23.d:0 "'He who acts in the guise of those who have come before burdens himself with the expectation of success. Mark as the Fool that initiate who fails to learn the lessons of the thousand elders.' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\nA delegation from [country.GetName]'s realm arrived at the court of [Root.GetName] and participated in the Rite of Greeting, a traditional rite of the Black Demesne in which visitors from another court acknowledge the supremacy of the Acolyte in their own domain, and in return receive promises of protection. Unfortunately for the visitors, their lack of preparation and unwillingness to acknowledge their host's supremacy offended the Acolyte, who immediately banished them and sent them home. This has offended [country.GetName] and weakened relations between the two Acolytes."
 acolyte_interaction.23.a:0 "How pathetic."
 
 acolyte_interaction.24.t:0 "Concerto Delle Mystica"
 acolyte_interaction.24.d:0 "'Listen closely, child, for the song of all the World can be heard if only the magician listens to the humming of Creation.' - excerpt from the Black Tablet of Skeljor\nMusic is one of the great pleasures of the soul. [Root.GetName] has recognized this for many years, but has grown dissatisfied with the mundane and typical concerts. After much time and effort, [Root.GetName] has finally found the solution to this dissatisfaction -- a glorious magical symphony that enhances and manipulates the sound of the orchestra while providing an accompanying visual display that emphasizes the emotional content of each piece. The first concert of this new magical orchestra was a private showing for all the Acolytes of the Black Demesne, which was a brilliant success and has greatly increased the reputation and standing of [Root.GetName]."
 acolyte_interaction.24.a:0 "Splendid! Marvelous! Bravo!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.25.t:0 "Financial Acquisition"
 acolyte_interaction.25.d:0 "'The Seventh Initiate was rejected from union with Creation, for his obsession with that which is Above left him blind to those things which transpire Below.' - excerpt from the Failure of the Seventh Initiate.\nThe Black Demesne is a land of wonders, but even it has not overcome certain immutable laws of how societies function. Conflict, of course, is one, and all Acolytes are intimately familiar with it. But another of these laws is debt, and some Acolytes, such as [country.GetName], tend to forget that financial constraints bind even the most powerful mystic masters. The misfortune of one Acolyte is typically the fortune of another, and this case is no exception. [Root.GetName]'s comparative frugality has left them in an excellent position to buy out the vast majority of [country.GetName]'s realm."
 acolyte_interaction.25.a:0 "Money is just as real as magic."
 
 acolyte_interaction.26.t:0 "High Stakes Chess"
 acolyte_interaction.26.d:0 "'The realm and the Acolyte are one. Armies are but mere extensions of the Acolyte's body, a faculty to be commanded by their will alone.'\nThese are the first words of 'War in the Black Demesne', a long and extensive text widely read by almost the entire elite class. It seems as though two Acolytes have taken this passage very literally, as they showed in what was perhaps the most consequential game of chess ever played. Having agreed to a contest of wits rather than a contest of arms, [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] sat down across the black-and-white board and, through the assent of nothing but their will, made each piece tied to the lives of one of their battalions. Each captured piece represented a hundred deaths or more. Satisfied that the stakes of the game honored their station, the Acolytes played it to its conclusion, wielding the destructive forces of the arcane to claim their prizes of souls. The widow's tears and the orphan's wailing cry are simply facts of life when one serves one's betters. Let this game be a reminder of that, if nothing else."
 acolyte_interaction.26.a:0 "It was a bloody good game, though!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.27.t:0 "Illuminated in Moonlight"
 acolyte_interaction.27.d:0 "'O Universal Mind, in whom Reason is illuminated by moonlight, bestow upon this Acolyte those things kept hidden in shadow.' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\n[Root.GetName]'s network of informants is, like all servants of the Acolytes, seen as an extension of their person. Using magically enhanced techniques such as the sensory enhancement spells associated with the above incantation, this espionage service has spread out across the Demesne, reporting events from the courts of every Acolyte back home. In this, the mind of [Root.GetName] is well informed about all things, even those that that happen in the quiet places and under the cover of darkness."
 acolyte_interaction.27.a:0 "Knowledge is power, indeed."
 
 acolyte_interaction.28.t:0 "Reign of Terror"
 acolyte_interaction.28.d:0 "'O Ascending Star, let not the chattering creatures shake the coming Zenith.' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\nIt is not exactly a secret that most Acolytes consider mundane, everyday people who have not been initiated into the arcane mysteries to be little better than animals. Nevertheless, as a farmer may be particularly cruel to his livestock, so too has [Root.GetName] become unusually cruel to their subjects. Magic is freely wieled as a tool of domination by those capable, and agents of the state are empowered to summarily execute any 'uncooperative creature' who stands in the way of the swift completion of policy objectives. This black day marrs the reputation of the Acolytes among the common people, but intervention would seem improper. It seems to all the world as though these souls will be left to their fate of suffering and subjugation."
 acolyte_interaction.28.a:0 "May they receive the Acolyte's mercy."
 
 acolyte_interaction.29.t:0 "Vow of Friendship"
 acolyte_interaction.29.d:0 "'Seek, then, brothers in the arcane mysteries. A star ascends not on its power alone, but is carried to the Zenith through the blessings of fellow travelers.' -excerpt from the Black Tablet of Skeljor\n[Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] have consecrated a growing friendship through the three-day Rite of Bonding, which forms an empathic link between the two Acolytes. At the end, their sacred vow of friendship and stalwart loyalty is secured through the sacrifice of a hundred healthy animals. Marking each other in the mystically-infused blood, they declare their solemn allegiance for the whole world to see."
