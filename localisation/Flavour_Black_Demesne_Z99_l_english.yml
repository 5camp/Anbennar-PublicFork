 #Acolytes Interactions Events
 acolyte_interaction.1.t:0 "Gathering Forces"
 acolyte_interaction.1.d:0 "'To seek Reason, one must part with the Passions. See in war not tragedy, but the glory of tested minds.' -excerpt from the War Tablet\nWeep, ye pathetic souls who shy from battle! Hear the lamentations of cowards and babes! [Root.GetName] has begun to assemble able-bodied warriors behind the Acolyte's banner."
 acolyte_interaction.1.a:0 "There is much glory in blood!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.2.t:0 "Knowledge Sharing"
 acolyte_interaction.2.d:0 "'Whispered secrets are the currency of the Ascending Acolyte.' -excerpt from the Secret Book of the Darkened Sun\nThe esoteric obscura of the arcane arts often make for tantalizing secrets, jealously guarded by the powerful and ambitious. This makes it all the more remarkable that [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] have agreed to share their magical knowledge. What glories might this portend?"
 acolyte_interaction.2.a:0 "Taste the fruit of knowledge!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.3.t:0 "Experimental Success"
 acolyte_interaction.3.d:0 "'In ascending, the Acolyte hones each of the Three Aspects. Purify the soul and be reforged among the stars.' -excerpt from the Secret Book of the Darkened Sun\n[Root.GetName] understands that power comes from risk. There is no such thing as safe magic, and even the most powerful mages are easily hobbled by their fears. The arcane arts have rewarded the Acolyte's courage, granting a boon."
 acolyte_interaction.3.a:0 "Power is the ultimate reward."
 
 acolyte_interaction.4.t:0 "Experimental Failure"
 acolyte_interaction.4.d:0 "'In ascending, the Acolyte hones each of the Three Aspects, but beware! The Passions lay their traps, and the clouded mind is shunned by the chorus of Reason.' -excerpt from the Secret Book of the Darkened Sun\n[Root.GetName] understands that power comes from risk. There is no such thing as safe magic, and even the most powerful mages are easily hobbled by their fears. Unfortunately, the arcane arts have not served the Acolyte well in this case, leaving former wellsprings of power tainted and unusable."

 acolyte_interaction.5.d:0 "'The Dreamers traverse the grove, hand-in-hand. There they were found by the spirit of Creation, who saw in their love not the Passions but Beauty Ascendant.' -excerpt from Wisdom of the Magician's Grove\nTo be an Acolyte is to wander alone through the darkness, to fearlessly face the boundaries of knowledge armed with only one's own wit and determination. It is a lonely path, as no Acolyte can find peers among the wretched and pathetic weaklings. Fortunately, [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] have found one another and began an amorous partnership. One would be wise to remember that power often follows love..."

The Dreamers, visited once by Creation, were now met by Negation, the darker twin, who tore them asunder and birthed Beauty Descendant.' -excerpt from Wisdom of the Magician's Grove\nThe very air feels heavy with grief and the raindrops are as knives. Nature itself weeps in heartbreak for the dissolution of the romantic partnership between [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName]! However, all true disciples of the arcane know that pain and fury make for potent fuel indeed."

 acolyte_interaction.7.t:0 "Incredible Ruler"
 acolyte_interaction.7.d:0 "'Neglect not the material world, but aid it in its ascension, and reunite it once more with the Universal Mind.' -excerpt from the Memoirs of an Arcane Steward\n[Root.GetName] is a model of competent governance. All sing the Acolyte's praises, and all recognize them as the rightful sovereign of this land. Power justifies itself by being applied to the benefit of the realm, and by being applied to punish those enemies, foreign or domestic, who would undermine the nation."
 acolyte_interaction.7.a:0 "Love can be as useful as fear."
 
 acolyte_interaction.8.t:0 "Absolute Debauchery"
 acolyte_interaction.8.d:0 "'The Seventh Initiate was marked as the Fool on his fifth night in the City of Reason, for he was found amidst the Passions rather than in quiet contemplation.' -excerpt from The Failure of the Seventh Initiate\n[Root.GetName] has gained a reputation for spending too many nights enjoying the carnal pleasures of the flesh and reveling in the opportunities for merry-making provided by the arcane arts. These distracts have allowed the apparatus of the state to fall into considerable disrepair, and the people have begun to plot against [Root.GetName]. Even the other Acolytes whisper mockingly. Can such humiliation truly be borne?"

I shall be your guide to the secrets of the Final Gates, and in so doing I shall reveal all the many lies you have been told. The very act of your reading this book shall be a glorious event in the history of this world. Come, then. Claim your legacy.' -excerpt from the Secret History of Anti-Illumination\nTo a mortal, death is an impenetrable barrier. Their impotent protestations do not slow it, and the reaper's scythe unerringly comes to claim the souls of their loved ones. But to [Root.GetName], a legendary necromancer, death is only the beginning. The great harvest has only just begun, and an army of the undead rises under the clouds of a gathering storm."

 acolyte_interaction.10.t:0 "Unnatural Beauty"
 acolyte_interaction.10.d:0 "'The Fool is seen, the Sage is beheld.' -excerpt from Wisdom of the Magician's Grove\n[Root.GetName] is a legendary enchanter and has used this ability to improve their own appearance. Such unnatural and unearthly beauty seems almost eerie and off-putting to the common folk, but comes across as absolutely irresistible to the refined tastes of Acolytes of the opposite sex."

 acolyte_interaction.11.t:0 "A Tribulation of Gold"
 acolyte_interaction.11.d:0 "'It is often wrongly believed that the ultimate goal of alchemy is transmutation into gold, as this is trivial for a master of transmutation. It is, however, the most profitable goal of alchemy.' -excerpt from the Codex Alchemica.\n[Root.GetName] is a legendary transmutation mage. Breaking one of the norms of the Black Demesne's monetary policy, they have transmuted massive amounts of raw material directly into gold. This has brought them considerable wealth at the expense of causing massive inflation across the Demesne."
 acolyte_interaction.11.a:0 "Curses!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.12.t:0 "Nurturing A New Body"
 acolyte_interaction.12.d:0 "'O Ascending Star! May your death be cause for celebration, for your rebirth is at hand!' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\nThe body is such a fragile thing. Delicate, and prone to failure, it simply cannot be trusted to last an Acolyte for eternity. Nevertheless, the soul must be chained to one of these vessels of flesh to continue affecting the physical world, and so [Root.GetName] has begun the process of growing an empty shell to move into upon their death."

 acolyte_interaction.13.t:0 "Research Stolen"
 acolyte_interaction.13.d:0 "'Be unbound, brothers. Be not distracted by the consideration of the chattering creatures. All that is known is your birthright.' -excerpt from the Black Tablet of Skeljor\n[Root.GetName]'s agents have dared to steal the magical research of another Acolyte! Though this cannot be definitively proven, all available evidence points to the same culprit. They will no doubt profit handsomely from this research. Fortune does favor the bold, after all."
 acolyte_interaction.13.a:0 "Delectable secrets..."
 
 acolyte_interaction.14.t:0 "Magical Supremacy"
 acolyte_interaction.14.d:0 "'O Universal Mind, call forth the Chorus of Reason to bear witness to your servant, the Acolyte Ascendant, the Stellar Zenith, master of the Twin Forces, bearer of the Thousand Secrets.' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\nThere is no school of magic that [Root.GetName] has not mastered. A true Acolyte of the esoteric and arcane, their reputation precedes them in any hall dedicated to the pursuit of mystical truths. It is possible they are the single most powerful being on the planet. The Acolyte's glory knows no bounds in the Demesne, and it is difficult for even other Acolytes to seriously challenge their claim to absolute supremacy."

 acolyte_interaction.15.d:0 "'Acolyte! A Seeker stands before thee. This one bears the Mark, and this one has heard Creation's voice. Beckon, then, your fellow traveler, and may we entreat the Universal Mind for its blessings.'\n[Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] performed the Rite of Peerage, a mystical rite acknowledging another mage that has been used to show respect between Acolytes for many years. Though the rite itself has little practical effect, it signals to the rest of the Demesne that the Acolytes and their respective realms have grown closer."
 acolyte_interaction.15.a:0 "I greet thee, Seeker."
 
 acolyte_interaction.16.t:0 "Bond Forged in Silence"
 acolyte_interaction.16.d:0 "'Brothers! Stand with me in the assembly of souls! Lend me your strength, and beckon home the whims of Creation and Negation!' -excerpt from the Tablet of Final Contemplation\nMagic is full of unsolved problems -- some, like the Dark Matrices, may even be unsolvable. But more common than the unsolvable problems are those which are simply too difficult for even an Acolyte to tackle alone. Two working together, however... such a team is not easily dissuaded from the acquisition of arcane knowledge. Such is the case for [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName]."

This is the first stone laid on the path to the Universal Mind. Acolyte, listen for it in the quiet moments, where all melts away before the thrumming of Creation's voice.' -excerpt from the Record of Ascension\n[Root.GetName] has refused all visitors for several days now, having locked themselves in a laboratory some time ago. This is entirely expected, and the ministers of state know that such activities can only mean one thing: the Acolyte's secret research nears a new breakthrough."
 acolyte_interaction.17.a:0 "The precipice of glory!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.18.t:0 "Secret Research Succeeds"
 acolyte_interaction.18.d:0 "'In quietude the mind ascends, seeking fragments of union with the universal intellect who all creation obeys. Behold the ascending star, whose form is forged in the Heavens! The chorus of Reason acclaims the descent of knowledge. Acolyte, claim the Stars!' -excerpt from the Record of Ascension\n[Root.GetName] has emerged from scholastic seclusion to lay out a fully-proven theorem demonstrating some finer point of mystical obscura before their closest advisors. This period of research has undoubtedly been a success."
 acolyte_interaction.18.a:0 "Eureka!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.19.t:0 "Secret Research Fails"
 acolyte_interaction.19.d:0 "'In quietude the mind ascends, seeking fragments of union with the universal intellect who all creation obeys. But the Universal Mind is fickle, and rewards only those of pure dedication for whom all concerns have melted away.' -excerpt from the Record of Ascension\n[Root.GetName] has emerged, sullen, from scholastic seclusion. An incomplete and unproven theorem is the only thing they have to show for this period of research. Though this experience may teach them valuable lessons for the years to come, it is a bitter disappointment in the present moment."
 acolyte_interaction.19.a:0 "Alas, such is the burden of knowledge."
 
 acolyte_interaction.20.t:0 "Military Cooperation"
 acolyte_interaction.20.d:0 "'Through blood is iron consecrated, and through blood is union forged. The magician who dwells at the base of the mountain climbs only through brotherhood and accord. Seek in every act a partner whose ties are built on the forge of flesh.' -excerpt from Contemplations of the Mystic Blade\n[Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] have formalized a deal that will provide for cooperation, information sharing, and strategic partnership between the militaries of the two Acolytes."
 acolyte_interaction.20.a:0 "Such things are here today, gone tomorrow."

 acolyte_interaction.21.d:0 "'The thrice-blessed magician is he who masters the magic of men's hearts, who speaks into their soul the burning fire of will.' -excerpt from Wisdom of the Magician's Grove\nEach Acolyte is different, and they each have unique strengths and weaknesses. For [Root.GetName], there can be no doubt that an incredible gift for oratory is the primary strength. Delivering fiery speeches promising glory, purpose, and prosperity, one wonders just how far the Acolyte can get on words alone."
 acolyte_interaction.21.a:0 "A remarkable gift."
 
 acolyte_interaction.22.t:0 "Rite of Greeting Goes Well"
 acolyte_interaction.22.d:0 "'Purify yourself in rite and ritual, to see as marked out before you those who carry also the blessings of the Universal Mind.' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\nA delegation from [country.GetName]'s realm arrived at the court of [Root.GetName] and participated in the Rite of Greeting, a traditional rite of the Black Demesne in which visitors from another court acknowledge the supremacy of the Acolyte in their own domain, and in return receive promises of protection. Fortunately for the visitors, they performed their duties admirably and have secured a temporary improvement in the relations between [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName]."
 acolyte_interaction.22.a:0 "We are bound together by tradition."
 
 acolyte_interaction.23.t:0 "Rite of Greeting Goes Poorly"
 acolyte_interaction.23.d:0 "'He who acts in the guise of those who have come before burdens himself with the expectation of success. Mark as the Fool that initiate who fails to learn the lessons of the thousand elders.' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\nA delegation from [country.GetName]'s realm arrived at the court of [Root.GetName] and participated in the Rite of Greeting, a traditional rite of the Black Demesne in which visitors from another court acknowledge the supremacy of the Acolyte in their own domain, and in return receive promises of protection. Unfortunately for the visitors, their lack of preparation and unwillingness to acknowledge their host's supremacy offended the Acolyte, who immediately banished them and sent them home. This has offended [country.GetName] and weakened relations between the two Acolytes."
 acolyte_interaction.23.a:0 "How pathetic."
 
 acolyte_interaction.24.t:0 "Concerto Delle Mystica"
 acolyte_interaction.24.d:0 "'Listen closely, child, for the song of all the World can be heard if only the magician listens to the humming of Creation.' - excerpt from the Black Tablet of Skeljor\nMusic is one of the great pleasures of the soul. [Root.GetName] has recognized this for many years, but has grown dissatisfied with the mundane and typical concerts. After much time and effort, [Root.GetName] has finally found the solution to this dissatisfaction -- a glorious magical symphony that enhances and manipulates the sound of the orchestra while providing an accompanying visual display that emphasizes the emotional content of each piece. The first concert of this new magical orchestra was a private showing for all the Acolytes of the Black Demesne, which was a brilliant success and has greatly increased the reputation and standing of [Root.GetName]."
 acolyte_interaction.24.a:0 "Splendid! Marvelous! Bravo!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.25.t:0 "Financial Acquisition"
 acolyte_interaction.25.d:0 "'The Seventh Initiate was rejected from union with Creation, for his obsession with that which is Above left him blind to those things which transpire Below.' - excerpt from the Failure of the Seventh Initiate.\nThe Black Demesne is a land of wonders, but even it has not overcome certain immutable laws of how societies function. Conflict, of course, is one, and all Acolytes are intimately familiar with it. But another of these laws is debt, and some Acolytes, such as [country.GetName], tend to forget that financial constraints bind even the most powerful mystic masters. The misfortune of one Acolyte is typically the fortune of another, and this case is no exception. [Root.GetName]'s comparative frugality has left them in an excellent position to buy out the vast majority of [country.GetName]'s realm."
 acolyte_interaction.25.a:0 "Money is just as real as magic."
 
 acolyte_interaction.26.t:0 "High Stakes Chess"
 acolyte_interaction.26.d:0 "'The realm and the Acolyte are one. Armies are but mere extensions of the Acolyte's body, a faculty to be commanded by their will alone.'\nThese are the first words of 'War in the Black Demesne', a long and extensive text widely read by almost the entire elite class. It seems as though two Acolytes have taken this passage very literally, as they showed in what was perhaps the most consequential game of chess ever played. Having agreed to a contest of wits rather than a contest of arms, [Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] sat down across the black-and-white board and, through the assent of nothing but their will, made each piece tied to the lives of one of their battalions. Each captured piece represented a hundred deaths or more. Satisfied that the stakes of the game honored their station, the Acolytes played it to its conclusion, wielding the destructive forces of the arcane to claim their prizes of souls. The widow's tears and the orphan's wailing cry are simply facts of life when one serves one's betters. Let this game be a reminder of that, if nothing else."
 acolyte_interaction.26.a:0 "It was a bloody good game, though!"
 
 acolyte_interaction.27.t:0 "Illuminated in Moonlight"
 acolyte_interaction.27.d:0 "'O Universal Mind, in whom Reason is illuminated by moonlight, bestow upon this Acolyte those things kept hidden in shadow.' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\n[Root.GetName]'s network of informants is, like all servants of the Acolytes, seen as an extension of their person. Using magically enhanced techniques such as the sensory enhancement spells associated with the above incantation, this espionage service has spread out across the Demesne, reporting events from the courts of every Acolyte back home. In this, the mind of [Root.GetName] is well informed about all things, even those that that happen in the quiet places and under the cover of darkness."
 acolyte_interaction.27.a:0 "Knowledge is power, indeed."
 
 acolyte_interaction.28.t:0 "Reign of Terror"
 acolyte_interaction.28.d:0 "'O Ascending Star, let not the chattering creatures shake the coming Zenith.' -excerpt from the Book of the Universal Mind\nIt is not exactly a secret that most Acolytes consider mundane, everyday people who have not been initiated into the arcane mysteries to be little better than animals. Nevertheless, as a farmer may be particularly cruel to his livestock, so too has [Root.GetName] become unusually cruel to their subjects. Magic is freely wieled as a tool of domination by those capable, and agents of the state are empowered to summarily execute any 'uncooperative creature' who stands in the way of the swift completion of policy objectives. This black day marrs the reputation of the Acolytes among the common people, but intervention would seem improper. It seems to all the world as though these souls will be left to their fate of suffering and subjugation."
 acolyte_interaction.28.a:0 "May they receive the Acolyte's mercy."
 
 acolyte_interaction.29.t:0 "Vow of Friendship"
 acolyte_interaction.29.d:0 "'Seek, then, brothers in the arcane mysteries. A star ascends not on its power alone, but is carried to the Zenith through the blessings of fellow travelers.' -excerpt from the Black Tablet of Skeljor\n[Root.GetName] and [country.GetName] have consecrated a growing friendship through the three-day Rite of Bonding, which forms an empathic link between the two Acolytes. At the end, their sacred vow of friendship and stalwart loyalty is secured through the sacrifice of a hundred healthy animals. Marking each other in the mystically-infused blood, they declare their solemn allegiance for the whole world to see."

 Z99_promote_meritocracy_title:0 "Promote Meritocracy"
 Z99_promote_meritocracy_desc:0 "Given the legal status of necromancy, there is little use for the dumb grunt in our military. As a result, we must maintain obsessive focus on the quality and merit of even non-magical recruits."

 Z99_sailing_the_reach_title:0 "Sailing the Reach"
 Z99_sailing_the_reach_desc:0 "We have successfully used scrying to identify where the surges might be coming from. We must now dispatch agents to do the hard work of searching in person. For that, the establishment of a grand shipyard will be an absolute necessity."
 Z99_finding_the_surge_title:0 "Finding the Surge"
 Z99_finding_the_surge_desc:0 "Our agents have pinpointed the exact location of the magical surge. The waves of fear wafting off their communication spells indicate the source is suitably epic... and draconic."
 Z99_jorgurem_the_frozen_title:0 "Jorgurem the Frozen"
 Z99_jorgurem_the_frozen_desc:0 "Jorgurem the Frozen, an ancient dragon of impeccable pedigree and a descendant of Elkaesal, has been tracked to his lair. Now we must demonstrate to the world that the new magical order will bring the ascendancy of the mortal races over such relics of the past."
 Z99_scepter_of_scepters_title:0 "Scepter of Scepters"
 Z99_scepter_of_scepters_desc:0 "Ancient magical beasts such as dragons are suffused with the very essence of magic itself, having accumulated and purified it over their long lives. Using this power is unimaginably dangerous, which is why we must ensure we develop a suitably powerful scepter before we attempt to harness it."
 Z99_arise_title:0 "Arise"
 Z99_arise_desc:0 "Binding souls is simple when they belong to mere mortals, but the soul of a dragon is far greater. A well-developed location inhabited by mortals is necessary to provide an anchor for our ritual. Not an easy task, but the reward shall be... sublime."
 Z99_ibevar_title:0 "Ibevar"
 Z99_ibevar_desc:0 "The Mystic Revolution marches onward, and our next task shall be to sweep away the haughty pretenses of the elves' rarefied but ultimately pathetic attempts to harness the forces of creation."
 Z99_of_teal_blood_title:0 "Of Teal Blood"
 Z99_of_teal_blood_desc:0 "Ah, the sweet taste of dominion. The conquest of Ibevar leaves us with a conundrum, however. How ought we handle the former masters of this land?"
 Z99_a_crown_of_gold_title:0 "A Crown Of Gold"
 Z99_a_crown_of_gold_desc:0 "Control of wealth and financial institutions is often considered a source of great power by the mundane nations. To fund our operations, and to demonstrate the folly of this notion, it is time for the Mystic Revolution to come to Damescrown."
 Z99_a_tower_of_black_title:0 "A Tower Of Black"
 Z99_a_tower_of_black_desc:0 "We are not the first to attempt the project of dominion via magic. Venac the Arrogant built Bal Vertesk long ago during his reign as Sorcerer-King. We must recapture this symbol of our heritage to demonstrate our fulfillment of that ancient dream."
 Z99_the_coal_river_title:0 "The Coal River"
 Z99_the_coal_river_desc:0 "The Alenic Frontier is filled with coal, being by far the largest deposit we are aware of.

 Z99_citizen_integration_title:0 "Citizen Integration"

 Z99_a_new_supply_title:0 "A New Supply"
 Z99_a_new_supply_desc:0 "We have performed feats far beyond the reckoning of unworthy fools, and we shall perform greater still. But doing this will require a far greater supply of Damestear -- we must acquire it to secure our ascension."
 Z99_freeing_the_minds_title:0 "Sanctify the Mind"
 Z99_freeing_the_minds_desc:0 "Magic is the sacred product of a well-disciplined intellect brought into union with the Universal Mind. The gnomes have tried to work around this process via the creation of the abomination known as 'artifice'. This scourge must be dealt with."

 Z99_pacifiy_the_east_desc:0 "Some of the mundane residents of the former nations of Eastern Cannor have decided to resist the new order. They must be made to see that their new role is to serve the glorious ascension of the mortal races through the sacred discipline of magic."
 Z99_gone_with_the_old_title:0 "Gone With the Old"
 Z99_gone_with_the_old_desc:0 "The role the Adventurers have played in recent history cannot be understated, and they are a valuable source of materials from monsters and mystic beasts. Nevertheless, they represent an unacceptable alternative power base and must be restructured to serve the Demesne."
 Z99_new_sheriff_in_town_title:0 "A Wand in the Dark"
 Z99_new_sheriff_in_town_desc:0 "Previous incarnations of sorcerous realms have centered around a singular figure who hoarded knowledge and power. This was their undoing. We must delegate the responsibilities for enforcement of the laws and pacification of the people to our acolytes."

 Z99_freeing_the_slaves_title:0 "Freeing the Slaves"
 Z99_freeing_the_slaves_desc:0 "Slavery is an abomination, the ultimate subjugation of sacred intellect, as possible magicians are forced to toil away in hard physical labor.

 Z99_the_means_of_production_title:0 "The Means of Production"
 Z99_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "The Great Liberation of Dostanor has granted us a pool of initiates with personal knowledge of industry. We should task them with wisely investing the Demesne's resources to improve production."

 Z99_the_means_of_projection_desc:0 "It is time we turn our attention to the Bulwar Sea, where we have little capability to project power despite its strategic importance. Eborthil and the isles around it will make an excellent location for both rituals and more mundane military affairs."
 Z99_seven_jewels_title:0 "Seven Jewels"

 Z99_a_field_of_dust_desc:0 "Though the Demesne is unquestionably the master of the world, many still lay outside our dominion. Their pathetic lands are largely uninteresting to the enlightened Magus. Nevertheless, the fertile farms of the Small Country could be put to more efficient use under our direction."
 Z99_elven_resort_title:0 "Elven Resort"
 Z99_elven_resort_desc:0 "Control of Redglade fits neatly into the grander scheme -- it is a perfect site to reward loyal initiates with the pleasures of the world, far away from real power."
 Z99_a_noble_delicacy_title:0 "A Noble Delicacy"
 Z99_a_noble_delicacy_desc:0 "Many fools falsely claim that the Universal Mind abhors unnecessary pleasure, but the sharpened intellect is easily able to resist excess temptation. It is only righteous for us to assume control of Cannor's wine production, so that we may distribute it more wisely."
 Z99_freeing_the_body_title:0 "Freeing the Body"
 Z99_freeing_the_body_desc:0 "The material world is but an illusion, shackles and chains for the mind. The Kobolds may not be capable of developing a well-disciplined intellect, but we can shatter their material chains -- and gain precious Damestear in the process."
 Z99_renaissance_title:0 "The Dark Renaissance"
 Z99_renaissance_desc:0 "The Black Demesne's core philosophy is the primacy of magic in all things. With our ascendancy, the time has come to apply this to art and architecture and consign the pathetic 'art' of the mundane world to the dustbin of history."

 Z99_absolute_power_title:0 "Absolute Power"
 Z99_absolute_power_desc:0 "The Ascending Star watches all from its station above the world, reshaping and rebuilding all things at a whim. The power of the Midnight Throne does not wane, the encroaching darkness consumes all who lie in wait."
 Z99_corrupt_absolutly_title:0 "Corrupts Absolutely"
 Z99_corrupt_absolutly_desc:0 "The tragic weakness of our neighbors begets chaos and uncertainty. The reach of the Ashen Crown must extend far beyond our borders to deal with the imperfection of the world."
 Z99_bringer_of_order_title:0 "Bringer Of Order"
 Z99_bringer_of_order_desc:0 "Life outside the Demesne is nasty, poor, brutish, and short. Through the cultivation of intellect, we have brought into being the purest harmonies of all history. When we impose our will on others, it is not out of a desire for violence, but a thirst for everlasting order and peace."
 Z99_in_thy_name_title:0 "In Thy Name"
 Z99_in_thy_name_desc:0 "All lay tribute at the feet of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Ascending Star of the Midnight Throne. A great festival has been called to honor the Demesne's innumerable contributions to the lives of its people."
 Z99_to_his_chosen_few_title:0 "To His Chosen Few"
 Z99_to_his_chosen_few_desc:0 "Previous magical monarchs have been overwhelmed and consumed by narcissism and paranoia. The Sorcerer-King has come to the concnlusion that, to avoid this fate, power, knowledge, and responsibility must be shared with a chosen group of mages known as the Acolytes, who will bear His word in their respective domains."
 Z99_the_blakpurgis_title:0 "The Blackpurgis"
 Z99_the_blakpurgis_desc:0 "The great magical tournament known as the Blackpurgis is surely a spectacle unlike any other in the world, but few deign to even be nearby as it unfolds, the Acolytes and Sorcerer-King competing to demonstrate their mystical prowess with little concern for the welfare of those nearby or even the local stability of reality. The winner is the mightiest mage of all, and thus crowned under the watchful gaze of the Universal Mind."
 Z99_west_deepwoods_title:0 "West Deepwoods"
 Z99_west_deepwoods_desc:0 "The Deepwoods are a fantastically interesting place, one of the largest-scale interactions of the mystical with mundane nature.

 Z99_scepter_industry_title:0 "Scepter Industry"
 Z99_scepter_industry_desc:0 "With the growing number of initiates and mages, there has been a level of demand for scepters never before seen on Cannor.

 Z99_the_twin_spies_title:0 "The Twin Spies"
 Z99_the_twin_spies_desc:0 "Action can only be taken with knowledge, meaning the acquisition of knowledge is of prime importance. We have good reason to believe the conquest of Tellum and Nathalaire will be of great assistance in this."

 Z99_the_eyes_and_the_ears_desc:0 "Tellum and Nathalaire shall be two great cities at the heart of our information network, the beating heart of the nation's mind.

 Z99_operation_overseer_desc:0 "Operation Overseer is a planned invasion of Sarhal, proposed to the Acolytes and the Sorcerer-King by one of the Demesne's top generals.

 Z99_the_khet_shores_desc:0 "Kheterata still stands outside our influence, and with such a symbol of historical endurance standing in defiance of the Mystic Revolution, there will always be doubts about our new order. It is time to establish the Demesne's base of operations on their shores."
 Z99_stabilizing_our_grip_title:0 "Stabilizing Our Grip"
 Z99_stabilizing_our_grip_desc:0 "Control of North Sarhal is tenuous as long as we remain distantly removed overlords. A project of deliberately settling loyal subjects will be key to fully integrating these lands into the Demesne."

 Z99_fate_of_the_ancients_title:0 "Fate Of The Ancients"
 Z99_fate_of_the_ancients_desc:0 "The elves and dwarves are ancient races, a symbol of the old order itself. Their existence complicates our project of making the world anew and liberating mortals from the lies that keep them in chains. It is time to settle on a permanent policy."

 Z99_secure_the_south_title:0 "Secure the South"
 Z99_secure_the_south_desc:0 "A fortress protecting the passage into the South will substantially reduce the geographic area that must be kept under magical supervision. Such an action is therefore a most prudent undertaking."

 Z99_unveiling_the_shroud_desc:0 "The conquest of the Deepwoods must be undertaken with great care. It is no mere mundane realm, easily swept aside by the churning of mystic power. Careful preparation will be necessary to bring success."
 Z99_a_growing_need_title:0 "A Growing Need"
 Z99_a_growing_need_desc:0 "Our project is not to create a single all-powerful mage, but to create a circle of legendary magicians of incomparable intellect. Reagents, test subjects, raw materials, and mythic resources are all needed in great quantities for this pursuit."
 Z99_a_timber_need_title:0 "A Timber Need"
 Z99_a_timber_need_desc:0 "The wood of the demiurges' mundane world is next to worthless for our needs. Only the mystic trees of the Deepwoods can satisfy the growing need for magical timber in the Demesne."
 Z99_the_verdant_link_title:0 "The Verdant Link"

 Z99_breaking_the_quiet_title:0 "Breaking The Quiet"
 Z99_breaking_the_quiet_desc:0 "How can it be that the Deepwoods exist in a stable extraplanar realm of such size, with such free linkage to the world of the mundane? This violates all we thought we knew about the Dark Science! Further investigation is not only warranted, but urgent."
 Z99_secrets_of_the_veil_title:0 "Secrets Of The Veil"

 Z99_operation_sunset_title:0 "Operation Sunset"
 Z99_operation_sunset_desc:0 "The Midnight Throne cannot countenace any challenge to its primacy. The hubris of the mundanes who compare themselves to the rising and setting of the sun will not be tolerated for even one moment more than necessary. It is time to subdue these fools and shatter the demiurgic chains still found here."
 Z99_the_entrance_title:0 "The Entrance"
 Z99_the_entrance_desc:0 "The Sorcerer-King has declared that the independence of Brasan has ended -- and his word is not merely law for man, but also for nature. All that is left is for the machinery of state to carry out what He has made inevitable."

 Z99_the_heart_desc:0 "The say Bulwar is the great heart of this land, but it is merely the heart of the superstition, lies, and deceit perpetrated by the mundane. Time, then, to sacrifice it on the altar of intellect."

 Z99_the_first_acolyte_desc:0 "The Sorcerer-King has kept a coterie of loyal initiates and has taught them the hidden and obscure secrets of ancient times, of the Universal Mind, and of the coming zenith. Now one has marked themselves as deserving of a special place at His right hand."
 Z99_the_second_acolyte_title:0 "The Second Acolyte"
 Z99_the_second_acolyte_desc:0 "The Sorcerer-King shall correct the mistakes of those who came before -- the great work to be done cannot be compromised by hubris, narcissism, or selfishness. Another Acolyte must ascend, lest the death of but two fragile souls compromise all that is yet to be."

 Z99_wardens_of_the_state_desc:0 "The parentless creatures of the realm shall be placed under the benevolent care of the Midnight Throne. In return, it is only natural that they ought to render service and exist as a resource for His disposal. How they ought to be used is a matter yet to be discussed."
 Z99_collegia_oxcura_title:0 "Academy of Shadows"
 Z99_collegia_oxcura_desc:0 "Now that the darkest secrets of esoterica can be spoken again in the open, an institution must be created to teach this powerful knowing to the select few who can be trusted with such wisdom."
 Z99_test_subjects_title:0 "Test Subjects"

 Z99_border_laboratories_title:0 "Border Laboratories"
 Z99_border_laboratories_desc:0 "The borders of the Deepwoods are liminal spaces between the mundane and the magical, an ideal place for experimentation. A network of secret magical laboratories should be constructed there."

 Z99_luxury_industry_desc:0 "The Deepwoods are so vast, and so profitable, that all of our most industrious and productive magical pursuits can be satisfied and still have vast stores of magical wood left over.

 Z99_the_dames_tear_title:0 "The Dame's Tear"
 Z99_the_dames_tear_desc:0 "Damestear has been widely known for its magical properties for some time, and indeed it is absolutely crucial for any major working of arcana.

 Z99_the_nine_eternal_pillars_title:0 "The Nine Eternal Pillars"
 Z99_the_nine_eternal_pillars_desc:0 "Mortals who stare into the Fey realm are left dumbstruck in wondrous awe. Fortunately, our living gods are no mere mortals, and they remain unaffected.

 Z99_underground_path_title:0 "Underground Path"
 Z99_underground_path_desc:0 "Our grand construction project of nine great pillars continues apace, and further development by scores of magicians has produced a plan for condensing the Fey realm's magic into liquified damestear.

 Z99_the_well_of_majesty_desc:0 "'There is no law but His law, there is no word but His word, there is no light but His light. Give thanks for He who wields the Well, who scours the stars and lays them at the feet of mortalkind. Keep this prayer in your heart, and speak not one word of blasphemy.'"

 Z99_solaris_desc:0 "The Sorcerer-King himself shall appear in Bulwar, and he shall speak the incantation from dawn till dusk, and on the dawn of the second day the sun shall not rise over Bulwar, the Dark Star shall ascend in its place, and all shall know that He has come to claim the world."
 Z99_order_title:0 "Order"
 Z99_order_desc:0 "The creatures of Bulwar cower in fear, for the Dark Prophet brooks no questioning. How futile is rebellion when to fight Him is to fight the world itself? How shall one fight the sun which serves Him, or the moon? How shall one fight the land, the sea, the stars?"
