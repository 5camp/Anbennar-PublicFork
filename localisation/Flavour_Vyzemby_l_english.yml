 vyzemby_flavour.0.d:0 "A strange ship has arrived from a far off land, carrying a group of halfling explorers who claim to be from the Free City of Beepeck in the Empire of Anbennar. Their arrival is a momentous occasion, as it represents a reunion of two halfling communities that have been separated for ten thousand years. At first, conversation is stunted and awkward. However, when a cook brought a fresh plate of grilled tond from the kitchens - fish prepared in the traditional halfling manner - the sailors went silent, mouths watering. The Vyzemby present exchanged glances, recognizing these strangers for who they really were - fellow halflings who, after a long time at sea, wished to eat a hearty, familiar meal in good company. All at once, tables were pushed together, the court singer sang their finest melody, and a raucous feast was held that lasted well into the night."

 vyzemby_flavour.2.d:0 "A messenger arrives with news that this year's harvest has been especially fruitful. The people are enjoying an abundance of food and are in high spirits.

 vyzemby_flavour.3.t:0 "An Intellectual Rebirth"
 vyzemby_flavour.3.d:0 "Following the discovery of our Cannorian brothers, an intellectual blossoming has occurred in [Root.GetName]. Cultural exchange has caused a revolution in Vyzemby scholarly thinking. Pursuits such as poetry and the arts that have stagnated in rigid forms for centuries have seen waves of innovation inspired by foreign influence. It is truly a golden age for Vyzemby culture."
 vyzemby_flavour.3.a:0 "A glorious flourishing of culture!"
 vyzemby_flavour.4.t:0 "Spread of Printing"
 vyzemby_flavour.4.d:0 "As trading voyages led by Cannorian halflings have become a familiar sight on our shores, the language barrier has become more and more of an issue. The language they speak, which they call “common”, has no relation to our own, making it difficult for a Vyzemby to learn it with any degree of fluency. One Cannorian, however, has a solution. They generously gifted [Root.GetName] with a schematic of a device they called a “printing press”. They explained that this allowed for the mass production of books, which until now were far too expensive for common use. The local burghers of [Root.GetCapitalName] immediately saw the potential in this “printing press” and have begun producing copies of a Vyzemby-Common translation guide."
 vyzemby_flavour.4.a:0 "What a splendid idea!"

 vyzemby_flavour.5.d:0 "Fishermen on their way to make their morning catch spotted a strange sight on the shore of [shipwreck_location.GetName]. A ship bearing foreign markings has run aground on a local beach. The Vyzemby that stagger out explain that they are traders from [shipwreck_country.GetName] and they were forced to land due to a violent storm. The traders insist on being on their way as soon as possible to deliver their cargo of banana beer. They request assistance in getting their ship back into the water. Alternatively, their cargo could be put to better use elsewhere…"
 vyzemby_flavour.5.a:0 "Seize the ship and its cargo."
