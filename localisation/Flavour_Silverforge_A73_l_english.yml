Hundreds of temples and shrines would be built to Balgar within Silverforge Hall alone. Even as conststruction on Anvilwright was fully active, many built places of worship for the workers. When Escann was conquered by the Greentide, the only real option for the Balgarsmiths to go to was Silverforge. After some time they built a temple and intermingled with the local religious groups of Silverforge Hall until their departure. During their stay they left a mark on the clergy who are not only grateful for us housing an important group but also took after the Balgarsmiths' example and started working more closely with the government of Silverforge."

A73_Green_Slavery_in_Silverforge_desc:0 "As Silverforge started making extensive open-pit mining operations it became very clear we could not support the workforce neccessary for such a large undertaking. That was until Green Orc slaves began coming to through the Empire to be sold to the Aelentiri colonies in the west. Sensing opportunity, we bought slaves coming through the Corvurian route to work in our mines. Eventually, Silverforge was making quite a profit from the use of slave labor in the Silverforge Surface Mines, but slavery in the empire would not last and purchasing of slaves was banned. Fortnuately, Silverforge evaded scrutiny due to slavery here being based on a system of indentured service and intergenerational debt for the crimes of the orcs against civilization. The crimes being the atrocities commited against our people during the collapse of Aul-Dwarov and for the destruction done to the former kingdoms of Escann."

A73_Silver_Army_Engineer_Corps_desc:0 "The Carver Cartel has always had many skilled engineers, it's thanks to them that our elaborate open-pit mines have been made. As the Carver Cartel became more integrated with the administration, they started training their engineers in the art of seige warfare and field fortifications. After a few decades our army had a robust war engineer corp most of whom trained as sappers. With them taking up a large chunk of our army, it will make sieging easier."

It is our responsibility to be their voice, and we will not fail them."
A73_Silverforge_Hall_Drinking_Competitions:0 "Silverforge Hall Drinking Competitions"
A73_Silverforge_Hall_Drinking_Competitions_desc:0 "It started simple enough, workers coming to Silverforge Hall after working on the Anvilwright hold would drink and chat with other workers before retiring to their sleeping quarters. Eventually though, the humans that also used the pubs and inns would foolishly challenge the dwarves to drinking games. No matter what game they did the dwarves would always win. Soon this spread to the Esmarian river parties where humans would line up to challange the iron gullet of a dwarf. Some dwarves would accept multiple opponents at once to even the odds. The true show started when orcs began challenging the dwarves to the competition. Neither of the two races have a considerable win difference between each other, creating a new rivalry based on revelry instead of bloodshed."

A73_Guns_of_Strongbellow_desc:0 "After suffering catastrophic losses during the 4th Lilac War, the military of Silverforge was looking for ways to combat Cavalry dominated warfare that the Lorentish and their allies employed. This would soon be answered as, after a few decades of exploration, ancient dwarven weaponry was being discovered with some finding their way outside of the Serpentspine for those with enough coin. With these ancient weapons, the task of replicating their design was assigned to Grun Strongbellow. As the head of the project, he worked tirelessly and was able to make an early redesign of a rifle in 1523. It was fairly accurate for the time but would be too expensive for army-wide use. With this success, he went on to update the artillery batteries that Silverforge used keeping them above the curve in comparision to their neighbors. Strongbellow would die in 1589 of natural causes and would be remembered in Silverforge for his dedication and ingenuity. In 1652, a universiy was built and named after him dedicated to Gunsmithing and Metallurgy."

silverforge.1.t:0 "An Offer of Service"
silverforge.1.d:0 " Grun Strongbellow has been a rising figure in the social circles of Silverforge Hall. He is the son of Urist Strongbellow, a well-established cartel notary and belongs to the Adstunad, one of the oldest clans in the Havoral Divide. Due to his father’s influence among the cartels, Grun was able to study under visiting loremasters from Rubyhold, Ovdal Tungr, and even Marrhold throughout his late 20s and 30s. These opportunities were not wasted on the young Grun as he proved to have a prodigious memory. Soon into his adulthood, he became a master of hold studies, inventing sophisticated pulley systems to further aid the hold construction in Anvilwright, slow as progress was. To that end, he was also the originator of the surface mine prototypes outside of Silverforge Hall.\n\nNow, he has come before $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ with a rare collection of artifacts, an assortment of firearm pieces allegedly dating to the Last Days of the Dwarovar. He holds up a barrel to reveal the spiral engraving along the inside, claiming to be able to reproduce this pattern and that it would increase the accuracy of our own weapons. While it is not clear what he is basing this claim on, having such a prestigious individual among the court would increase the political standing of the republic."
silverforge.1.a:0 "Give him the resources to tinker and see what he comes up with."
silverforge.2.t:0 "Opportunities from the Orc Trade"
silverforge.2.d:0 "Orcs have long been the enemies of dwarven civilization. Though the loremasters claim they were not the cause of the Last Days of Dwarovar, they wrested control of the Serpentspine from the dwarves and barred us from our home even so. Following the loss of the Serpentspine, orcs had only made the rare raid into the open air of Escann. While these threats never amounted to much, the dwarves knew of their potential should they ever rally in large enough numbers. This came to pass in 1424, when the Greentide washed over Escann led by Korgus Dookanson. The orcish army destroyed the successor states of Castanor and nearly reached the Havoral Divide until the Greentide Vanguard was routed at the Battle of Rottenstep. Without this small victory, Silverforge would have been helpless to defend the Empire having lost most of its army in the 4th Lilac War. \n\nBut now, we have rebuilt our army and improved upon its composition. We have expanded our territory to encompass the duchy of High Esmar, and with the discovery that Aelantir is once again inhabitable, orc prisoners of war are being transported through our lands. It is believed that these prisoners will make valuable slaves in the newly forming colonies. However, this might be the opportunity we have been waiting for. With the increased size of our realm, and an ample supply of labor, we might be able to complete the mining project proposed by Strongbellow. The land survey has already been commissioned. We shall purchase our own slaves and put them to work as debt laborers to pay for their crimes against our first home in Aul-Dwarov and our second home in Escann."
silverforge.2.a:0 "May they never again threaten our third home in the Havoral Divide."
silverforge.3.t:0 "Rising Dwarven Power"
silverforge.3.d:0 "The political tides change swiftly within the Empire and we have done well to avoid the squabbles of pretenders and claimants, as we remained neutral during the 4th Lilac War. Still, neutrality can be a rare luxury at times of war, especially with troops at the city gates. Now, the tides have turned again with the election of a new Emperor and Silverforge’s expansionist mining policies. They have even petitioned the Emperor to resolve their supposed claim to our countryside beyond the city limits. We are no enemies of the dwarves and know they would not attack a Free City. Perhaps it is time though to align ourselves with this rising power…"
silverforge.3.a:0 "The dwarven Electorship will help us to promote gnomish interests within the Empire."
silverforge.3.b:0 "No, we must maintain our autonomy as a Free City."
silverforge.4.t:0 "A Delegate of Investors"
silverforge.4.d:0 "Silverforge has invested greatly in Esmarian trade in an attempt to complete their hold. Even expanding their territory to control most of the local trade centers. In some regards, we have managed to profit from this as an important trading city ourselves. Still, we are very much on the outside looking in, and we would be better off integrating more fully into this new market. This opportunity seems to have arrived along with delegates from the unfinished hold. They propose a large investment in our markets to ensure their growth and integration with their local hegemony. We would still pay taxes to the Emperor as per our role as a Free City, but in exchange they ask that we come to their aid in their military endeavors."
silverforge.4.a:0 "We accept this generous offer."
silverforge.4.b:0 "We would never agree to such terms!"
silverforge.5.t:0 "Digging Ourselves into a Hole"
silverforge.5.d:0 "It has been known for nearly a millennium in Silverforge that the Havoral Divide does not have sufficient resources to construct a dwarven hold. Though the iron deposits within our realm are vast, they are not limitless, and our prospector mages had informed us long ago that we would have stripped our mines bare before collecting a quarter of the materials required. Instead, we have had to content ourselves with smithing. This is no low art of course, but it cannot compare to the multigenerational masterwork of a hold. There is no greater gift for the future, no more selfless act, than committing one’s life to a project that will not benefit them, yet would benefit countless generations to come. We are no halflings who sit in a hole and call it home. Yet here we are, no better. \n \nIt was in 1412 that a young Grun Strongbellow laid plans for a new type of mine, suggesting that while the terrain of Esmaria was not as resource rich as the mountains, a sufficiently large digging operation might provide us with the necessary material to complete our hold. Prototype mines were soon built outside Silverforge Hall, but the operation was halted as we rose to the aid of Adenn Skylance. It was believed that the war would be won, then we would complete our hold. Neither would be true. As Esmaria was flanked by Ibevar and Arbaran, our troops were overextended, caught in the East Dameshead, and wiped out by Lorentish Cavalry. With the end of the war, we returned to our mines, but Strongbellow had over-estimated the material return of the mines due to faulty prospecting. Even with this novel technique, Silverforge would require a mining army of Imperial quantity for such an operation to succeed."
silverforge.5.a:0 "From bad to worse..."
silverforge.6.t:0 "Sevrund's Band Sets Out"
silverforge.6.d:0 "'There are two kinds of Silver Dwarves. One is loyal to our history and hardship in the Havoral Divide. The other simply lives here. The annals of Silverforge Hall run replete with the history of our nation and of the Silver Dwarven people. From the fall of the tribal kingdom of the Havorals, to the fall of Great Cardest, to the fall of even greater Castanor, Silverforge has outlasted them all. We have seen eruptions, dragons, great curses and wars and wars and wars.' \n \nFirst, there was a green tide that washed over Escann from the east. Now it ebbs, and a new tide flows fromt the west as adventurers from across the known world seek fortune and glory from within the emptied Serpentspine. The dwarves of Silverforge, unlike most, no longer feel the call of Aul-Dwarov. Still, we are only a minority of the Silver Dwarves of East Dameria and Silverforge Hall has become a popular setting-off point for dwarven bands headed for the holds of old. Perhaps encouraged by this, many of our younger dwarves have begun to set out as well, for nothing more than the excitement of adventure. To end this tide of our own, we have started to issue adventuring licenses for our citizens, limiting them to the battlefields of Escann where they might do good to rebuild what Balgar once built and eventually return to our realm as the next generation of great clan leaders. One such youth is Sevrund Ironhearth. \n \nThough not yet an adult at 37, Sevrund is charismatic with a gaze as heavy and sudden as a hammer strike. He has quickly gathered a band of a few hundred to his name and swears to personally slay an orc for each of them and every dwarf yet to join. A proud dwarf by any measure!"

silverforge.8.t:0 "The Future of the Republic"
silverforge.8.d:0 "We cannot only rely on trade if we are ever going to collect the materials to complete our hold. We should look for means to expand our territory as well as our administration, so that we might pursue Strongbellow’s revised plans. This will require founding a new cartel to oversee the mining process as most current administration is overseeing hold construction and our Electorship within Imperial politics. We would still need to increase our workforce severalfold as well, but perhaps the locals could be convinced to aid the mining effort if we have no other option. Any progress is progress.\n\nYet, the question has been raised of how to handle our current cartels? They could see this as a power play to limit their influence to within our hold territory. We could encourage their practices in an attempt to pacify their concerns. However, this could lead to them interfering with organizing the new cartel. If, instead, we were strict in limiting their potential interference, this could cause instability in our realm."
silverforge.8.a:0 "We should encourage the cartels."
silverforge.8.b:0 "The cartels already have too much power."
silverforge.9.t:0 "The Future of the Republic"
silverforge.9.d:0 "We now hold Wexhills along with Bal Hyl at its center. Never again shall the Alenic Barbarians of House sil Wex rise above their status as dukes. As a minority Elector, we must hold the final blow or risk consequences for the Silver and Ruby Dwarves within the Empire who we represent. Still, it is enough to have taken the center of Wex’s power to prevent any further machinations they might have planned. Their poor rule, combined with the loss of their core territory, will ensure that no other realm will respect their position moving forward. Now, it is up to us to convince the Empire through our show of mercy and steady rule that our claim to Wexhills is righteous.\n\nThis has been with some difficulty, however, given that our neighbors have generally frowned upon our mining practices, with some even petitioning the Emperor to cease the operation. The Carver Cartel has taken the most offence to this, since it is a direct threat to their responsibilities as well as their power base. It can be difficult to keep the various cartels of our realm in line at times, but the Carvers especially. It seems that every day, more dwarves are joining in pursuit of their own ambitions. It has not gone unnoticed that the current $MONARCHTITLE$ is a member of the Carvers as well most of their top advisors. Perhaps $MONARCH$ should work limit the influence of the cartels, before they become a legitimate to our standing within the Empire."

silverforge.9.b:0 "The cartels already have too much power."
silverforge.10.t:0 "The Future of the Republic"
silverforge.10.d:0 "Our recent conquests have brought opportunities to Silverforge which we haven’t seen since before the founding of our hold. Once again, we hold Adstanad or ‘Oldpassage’ as it is referred to now and the tunnels leading to the Forlorn Vale. With a large population of Elves under our rule, we can begin investing in the elven goods trade. Ibevar has long been the leading cultural center for elven stylings due to their size and independent status. While we have certainly seen to cut down on their size, their artisans and merchants will still hold great sway, so long as we do not discourage the practice.\n\nAgain though, the cartel leaders have been elbowing each other out of the way to discuss dealings with $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. It has not helped matters that the $MONARCHTITLE$ is also a member of the Carver Cartel, further raising anxiety among the rest and causing them to ask for increased privileges to balance the power of individual cartels within the realm. It would be wise to assuage their fears, but at the same time the cartels have been gaining influence within the country across the board recently, not to mention the Carver’s disproportionate influence due to the size of their responsibilities…"

silverforge.20.t:0 "The Delegation of Privileges"
silverforge.20.d:0 "So far, the Carver Cartel has managed our mining operation with little integration to the rest of our government. They elect their own cartel leadership, resolve disputes, and collect their own taxes. Meanwhile, the government in Silverforge oversees the other cartels, the administration and completion of the hold, as well as all international affairs. This division of responsibilities has led to increasing inefficiency, however. The authority to mint coins is strictly regulated from Silverforge Hall, yet most exchanges now see currency leaving our realm for mining supplies. Trade relations can only be established by license from Anvilwright, yet the trade routes must be negotiated with respect to the surface mines. Daily, requests come in from the Carvers for new mining equipment, such that most of the armory cartels must put their primary work on hold, to forge these new tools en masse. Then there are the orcs… \n\nIndustrious to a fault, but haughty and stubborn, the orcs put to work in the mines are a constant source of tension. Occasionally, there is unrest within Silverforge Hall over the potential threat the orcs could present if they ever revolted on a large scale. Though the Carvers have never had difficulty keeping the orcs in line and in mine, the lack of interaction between Carver day-to-day operations and the average dwarf in the hold must be resolved to ensure the stability of our realm. The Carver Cartel must be further integrated into our administration. This will of course mean a trade in power: they will lose some authority over the running of the surface mines, while we will lose some authority over the other cartels and administrative divisions. The only question is how much we should give and where to ensure efficiency."
