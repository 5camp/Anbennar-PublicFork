 A99_dwarves_under_our_rule_desc:0  "Having conquered Anvilwright and Silverforge Hall, we must now decide how will we treat the dwarves in our lands: Will we try to integrate them into Varainé society (even if forcedly), or allow them to retain their autonomy and wait for integration to come on its own?"
 A99_small_problems_title:0  "Small Problems"

 A99_dwarves_and_orcs_desc:0  "The slavery and purging of orcs in Escann - and the subsequent fleeing of the persecuted orcs towards more tolerant places - presents Varainé with an interesting, but difficult decision. On one hand, we could accept these orcs with open arms, though this would be hard to swallow for most of our population and for the Dwarves under our rule. On the other hand, we could allow the orcs in our nation as laborers under the Dwarves, risking alienating their race even further."
 A99_pluralism_title:0  "Pluralism"
