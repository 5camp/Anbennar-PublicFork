# Missions, Modifiers and Events
 A99_reaching_out_title:0  "Reaching Out"
 A99_reaching_out_desc:0  "Our participation in the lilac wars under the Rose party helped Varainé gather favor with several nations around the empire. We should foster these connections, forging alliances and other friendly relations with our former war companions."
 A99_dwarves_under_our_rule_title:0  "Dwarves under our Rule"
 A99_dwarves_under_our_rule_desc:0  "Having conquered Anvilwright and Silverforge Hall, we must now decide how will we treat the dwarves in our lands: Will we try to integrate them into Varainé society (even if forcedly), or allow them to retain their autonomy and wait for integration to come on its own?"
 A99_small_problems_title:0  "Small Problems"
 A99_small_problems_desc:0  "With Bennonhill under our control, we've come to have significant Halfling and Gnome communities in our lands. Like the dwarves before them, we must decide how we'll try to integrate the short-folk into our society"
 A99_dwarves_and_orcs_title:0  "Dwarves and Orcs"
 A99_dwarves_and_orcs_desc:0  "The slavery and purging of orcs in Escann - and the subsequent fleeing of the persecuted orcs towards more tolerant places - presents Varainé with an interesting, but difficult decision. On one hand, we could accept these orcs with open arms, though this would be hard to swallow for most of our population and for the Dwarves under our rule. On the other hand, we could allow the orcs in our nation as laborers under the Dwarves, risking alienating their race even further."
 A99_pluralism_title:0  "Pluralism"
 A99_pluralism_desc:0  "After expanding its territory, Varainé is now home to various cultures and races. It would be wise to incorporate these disparaging groups into our society, as our openness to new peoples may reflect well on our rule and help our nation develop in interesting directions."
 A99_multiracial_diplomacy_title:0  "Multiracial Diplomacy"
 A99_multiracial_diplomacy_desc:0  "Now that our racial minorities have expanded and been integrated, it would be wise to look outwards for potential allies amongst the other Cannorian races and seeking to integrate these races further in our government. Who knows what benefits the alliances and advisors may bring to us in the future."
 A99_present_threats_title:0  "Present Threats"
 A99_present_threats_desc:0  "Varainé's current independence is a fickle matter, as many of our neighbors are larger, more powerful, and upset at the outcome of the Lilac Wars. Foremost of these neighbors are Leslinpár, of whom Varainé used to be a domain, and Silverforge, who control the nascents of the Logrodainé. To secure our continued existence as a sovereign nation, we must present a strong face to any would be enemies, especially the Dwarves and our former overlords."
 A99_secure_our_borders_title:0  "Secure our Borders"
 A99_secure_our_borders_desc:0  "While our allies and our newfound army may help deter immediate attacks, to ensure Varainé's independence into the future we must start looking outwards. Conquering our immediate surroundings should increase our means, and give us enough of a buffer, to help protect ourselves further into the future"
 A99_past_threats_title:0  "Past Threats"
 A99_past_threats_desc:0  "Varainé is now able to stand on its own two feet, free from the threat of it's previous enemies. However, despite not being threats to us anymore, having these former rivals under our rule - or better yet, completely destroyed - would help legitimize Varainé in the eyes of its neighbors."
 A99_charcoal_and_powder_title:0  "Charcoal and Powder"
 A99_charcoal_and_powder_desc:0  "While gunpowder had been known and employed by Dwarves since before the fall of Aul-Dwarov, only now is gunpowder becoming prevalent in Cannorian warfare. And Varainé, having extensive access to Sulfur from the Green River and Charcoal from its forests, as well as being closesly tied to the dwarves who once employed this technology, is in an extremelly privileged spot for its production. We should take advantage of this scenario, and develop ourselves into the proeminet producers of gunpowder in our region"
 A99_resources_of_mount_havoral_title:0  "Resources of Mount Havoral"
 A99_resources_of_mount_havoral_desc:0  "When Mount Havoral erupted during the Day of Ashen skies over 1000 years ago, it revealed many valuable deposits of ores and minerals, such as the Sulfur that characterises our Green River. If Varainé is to become ever more prosperous, it is vital that we secure these resources."
