Their call is not one to be denied. \n\nYou travel from Arakeprun with a small entourage, ready for the long journey to the Domandrod. You pass from the grandeur of Spring Court cities to the hinterlands in the east. Here the trees grow thick, and civilization sparse. Watching from above on the treetops, the Peitar look at you accusingly. Your loyal guards look around suspiciously with polearm and bow ready in hand, primed for threat to your person. But harm never comes to you, and before long even the homes of the Peitar dissapear into the deep forest of the Domandrod.

It cannot be a mere whim that you wake every day, every day that you command the fates of countless souls? \n\nYou command your caravan to stop for a rest by a small spring glistening from the sunlight that has pierced through the twilight of the Domandrod.
