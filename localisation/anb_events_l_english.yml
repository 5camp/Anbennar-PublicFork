His most recent, standing mere steps away from Corin, yet seemingly galaxies apart, as she rose her shield to defend him, slew and was slain by the Dookanson, and he watched the woman who had saved his life and his heart become something more.\n\nBut there are plenty of others that thrum through his brain as he sits in his tent in [Root.Capital.GetName], knowing soon he must rise and speak to Corin's — now whose? — Circle. His bitterest, watching sprawled on the ground, his sword and the two fingers it had carved from Karagh Bloodfist laying mere meters away, yet his arm still numb from the warleader's victorious blow in the Ozarm'Chadash, as his fellow half-orcs were executed to the man. His darkest, the time in a pit after that, cursing every god he knew the name of. His brightest, the sight of a human face, the red hair encircling it lit bright by the setting sun, offering him freedom from the pit in the ground and in his soul.\n\nAnd from there, it seems Corin is a bright red thread tangled through all his memories. His proudest, rising in a council of the Marcher Lords, seeing every face turn to him to outline their strategy — but his eyes only caught one other's. His most perplexed, as they spoke one night of her death at Rottenstep, and he strained his mind to encompass it. His most joyful, the night in her arms, and she in his, not two weeks prior.\n\nBut all that is the past now, severed as permanently from the present as Corin is now from mere mortality. It is just another thing he carries, like the scarf on his tusk. And so it is time for him to rise, speak to Her circle and Her followers.

Even though the manic chaos of those first few years has passed, when he forged a broken circle into Escann's sword and shield, Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna's work hasn't ceased.\n\nThere are always more campaigns to plan, even if he's not at their vanguard. There are always more adventuring disputes to smooth over, the same arguments arising again and again to the point he feels he could handle them in his sleep. There are always more forms to sign, more work orders to requisition, more trade agreements to be forged, new land to divvy up and old grudges to sort out. It's enough that the days blur by, sometimes. And the weeks, and the months. And the years.\n\nOr so Lothane realizes, one day, as he sits at his desk in the center of [Root.Capital.GetName]. What once was a command tent became the largest room in a hastily-constructed fort, then a similar space in a somewhat more sturdy fort, and now they've relocated him into one of the growing city's new castles. But when he puts down the paperwork, and steps into the stone hallways outside, he realizes he doesn't know anyone in the Corintar by name anymore.\n\nHe can still remember, vividly, Arosha's wicked grin as she bested him in a duel, Foolfoot's smile as he dealt a round of cards, Creekwhistle's fiery anger. But the faces that scurry through dusty corridors and bring him forms to sign, all those souls in the nearby, new-built, houses? They all love and respect him, but not a single one knows him.\n\nHe's pretty sure he's the only one that remembers the heft of Corin's blade, the dented steel of her shield; all the icons that crop up carved into wood or sketched on parchment don't quite capture it. And the ribbon around his tusk has frayed to mere strands.\n\nIt's time to go. Put down the sword, let someone else hold the shield. A quill, and a piece of parchment, and memories of love and loyalty and something more, will do for him now."

There was a small cottage, in the yet-untamed woods on the outskirts of [Root.Capital.GetName]. There was learning to share what remained of his heart. There was even an unexpected joy, raising children. And above all else, there was the writing, the memories.\n\nBluetusk had traded his sword and shield for quill and parchment, calloused hands working long hours by candlelight. For there was so much to share, so much that needed to be known. His first conversation with Corin, the night after she rescued him from the pit. The lessons in ethics and morals gathered accompanying her into battle. And all those hours the night before the battle of Castonath, the most searing glimpse he ever got of her burning soul. Wherever it was she had gone, he remained on Halann, and so did so many who needed to learn her ways.\n\nBut that is past, now. It is time for him to be laid to rest, his crusade finally coming to an end. He shall be mourned across the Corintar, across Escann. And perhaps, in wherever it is the Gods reside, the lady he gave his heart and soul to shall mourn him as well."

And seeking a better life for themselves and all of the orcish race, away from the poverty of the Dwarovar. And she is old enough to remember when Korgus fell, the true child of her beloved Dookan, slain by the human Corin.\n\nGrama Clouded Eye is old enough to remember all of that...

The woman who once insulted Varok Bladebreaker to his face and lived to tell the tale, is dead. The woman who rallied the disparate clans and tribes to the Dookanson's call, is dead. Grama Clouded Eye is dead, and the entire clan mourns.\n\nIt was as she lay on her death bed that she finally chose who her successor as clan chief would be. She had said that the Great Dookan himself had pointed out three exceptional young orcs to her in a vision, each exemplifying his strength in a different way, and each of which would be powerful clan chiefs in their own right.\n\nBagrum was no great warrior, and was often ridiculed by other orcs supposedly cowering behind defenses of his own construction. However, the Great Dookan knows that strength does not come only from a blade or a club. The other orcs stopped laughing at Bagrum once he saved them from a deadly charge of Cannorian knights with defenses he had hidden in the tall grass. The Dookan's children must have homes to live in and walls to protect themselves, and Bagrum would build those for his people.\n\nMeshug had always been considered soft by the other orcs. Whereas most of the Dookanson's followers were content to raid and pillage, Meshug found no satisfaction in such actions. Instead, Meshug spent hours in his tent, creating all of the things that other orcs simply stole from the lands they conquered. Why would Meshug waste so much time and effort making things, the other orcs asked, when he could just take them? Because, Meshug said, the Great Dookan is glorified not just in victorious battle, but in hard work, as well, in productive labor, to make life better for all of his children.\n\nKrunaka is the strongest warrior in Clouded Eye, able to best any male with ease. Unlike most orcs, though, Krunaka does not fight for the honor of the glory of it. No... Krunaka fights for peace. Other orcs laugh at her for it, of course. An orc that wants peace? What sort of orc is that? The Great Dookan, however, understands the strength that comes in peace, and would see Krunaka defeat the orcs' enemies and end decades of war and death.\n\nNo matter who Grama chose as her successor, the Clouded Eye clan would follow, for shaman's word was taken to be the word of the Great Dookan himself, whom none of the orcs would oppose. Who will Grama choose as the next clan chief?"

Heaps of rubble, gravel and dirt were long visible piled along the road, but now, after several weeks, they finally disappeared. The foundations have been restored where they still existed and built anew where time had wiped them away entirely. Now the outline of the road is clearly visible. With more time and effort the roads of Jaher will be returned to their former glory and we will reap the benefits. There is still a ways to go, but it's shaping up splendidly. For now the overseers in [Root.GetName] request further funding to continue the project."

Over the last few weeks the foundation of rubble and gravel has been bound together and reinforced with a layer of cement, turning the path into what can start to truly be described as a road. Preparations are already being made for the final step: Paving. However the costs of suitable stone are high and the overseers of [Root.GetName] say they need more coin to take the final step."

A message arrived in your palace in the midst of the night upon your table, written on a curious silky paper and with gracefully curving script. Despite the beautiful penmanship and sweet words, they are outraged by your actions, demanding your presence and explanation for your actions. Their call is not one to be denied. \n\nYou travel from Arakeprun with a small entourage, ready for the long journey to the Domandrod. You pass from the grandeur of Spring Court cities to the hinterlands in the east. Here the trees grow thick, and civilization sparse. Watching from above on the treetops, the Peitar look at you accusingly. Your loyal guards look around suspiciously with polearm and bow ready in hand, primed for threat to your person. But harm never comes to you, and before long even the homes of the Peitar dissapear into the deep forest of the Domandrod. The air is still and the glades calm, but all feels as tense as a drawn bowstring. Your journey is not over yet, but in this moment you hesitate and ponder over yourself. What is it you truly want, what is guiding your actions? It cannot be a mere whim that you wake every day, every day that you command the fates of countless souls? \n\nYou command your caravan to stop for a rest by a small spring glistening from the sunlight that has pierced through the twilight of the Domandrod. While the camp is set up you walk over to the pond with your personal guard Nestrin. You gaze into the still but clear water disturbed only by placid butterflies, you gaze into your reflection and truly realize who you are. \n\nThen you see in the reflections of the water an enchantingly beautiful woman draped in vines and a crown of rose thorn. Turning around, you see a monstrously huge man with a grotesquely horned mask, like a mass of antlers in every direction. The woman speaks to you with an unnerving smile. \n\n"What have you seen in the pool? Not all who enter the forest come here, but those who do always have a guilty conscience. I know that you are a leader most powerful, that your every word is one that carries great weight. So tell me, O great leader, what words will you say today?

True enough, after extensive dredging of sand, more of these substance was found: none other than Damestear itself. But most importantly, the source was found, a buried ruin beneath the sands. Inside a long forgotten chamber was used by the Precursors to summon forth Damestear into our very own land.

Pleased with the results, work was to begin to irrigate the rest of Harafe were it not for a particular concern: once activated, research on the Precursor machinery would halt. \n\nWith chambers flooded and complex enchantments activated, the facility becomes too dangerous to experiment with, and the risk of breaking the technology looms overhead.

Situated around a table outside with the salty breeze of the sea all around them, the Eordan and Elves discuss matters of their worlds: past, present, and future. They tell of their history, of the Day of Ashen Skies and the Remnant Fleet and the arrival to Cannor and Bulwar and beyond. Of wars and peace, of marriages and betrayal, and a longing to return home. \n\nWe tell them of the perils of Aelantir after the disastrous events, of the rebirth of Eordand and its long struggle to unite. The Eordan knew of other people in Aelantir, but did not know of the Elves who had sailed eastward. While the Ruinborn live short lives, the Elves live many centuries. Our accomplishments seemed small at first compared to their centuries of struggle against men, orcs, and even their own brethren, but we realized that we have rebuilt Eordand despite our short lives and polluted homeland. \n\nSome Elves look at us in envy and even hatred, such as the Star Elves of Aelnar. From the isle of Venáil as far west as they could sail, they dreamed of their homeland for generations, and at long last rediscovered Aelantir. But what they found was their home twisted from what the heaven they dreamed of, and the Ruinborn mockeries to what they imagined were left behind of the Elven people. Driving themselves mad with this revelation, Aelnar has foresook their Moon Elven brethren and looks to us as savages who squat on their birthright. \n\nArriving late, the representative of Dawn proudly announced their presence to the council, attracting various degrees of distrust and disgust. Hailing from Rezankand in Soruin, the Dawn Elves have looted and ransacked the Ruinborn realms of Taychend, Kheionai, and beyond. Championing the Bulwari Sun Cult, they have no tolerance for unbelievers. The Dawn Elf gloats and prides themselves on their accomplishments, but offers little of help. \n\nFinally, a letter is delivered at the port by the Sea Elves, explaining their interest in recent developments but that they have no intention of living on Aelantir oncemore. For them, their Arks are forever their home, only landing to resupply. For them, Aelantir is gone, for they have no desire to dwell on it's tainted soil. \n\nMoon, Sun, and Wood all come from different worlds, and often may disagree and clash. But they see Eordand restoring control of Aelantir to the Ruinborn, and ask us if there may be room for their wayward cousins."

But should they be removed? Our elders remember when the Merchant Lords were hired to turn the tide of battle, celebrated as heroes. Their skills as navigators and with unscrupulous matters, such as smuggling, have inspired countless victories and tales. \n\nThe decision is yours: will we offer the Merchant Lords service within our navy, or will we squash their troublesome thievery once and for all?"
 eordand.22.a:0 "The skills they know well, legitimate or not, will make them fine captains for our navy."
 eordand.22.b:0 "They can no longer harry us: let us be gone of their piracy!"
 eordand.23.t:0 "Hoard of the Dragon Prince"
 eordand.23.d:0 "While the grand city of Svemel is under Eordan control, there is still an influential figure who holds sway over the Rzentur: Varlengeilt, the Dragon Prince. A young green dragon born of the previous Dragon-God Drozmagog, Varlengeilt holds great sway over the hearts of the Drozma Tur faithful, and should he wish could agitate them further against us. However, for now he remains silent within his lair, a heavily guarded palace in Svemel, watching the city from its pinnacle. \n\nShould our liege wish, the palace and halls of worship may be looted for whatever may be found. But Varlengeilt's hoard is small, for after the death of Drozmagog it was split between the feuding Rzentur who each wished to raise the infant dragon. It would be wise to consider offering a donation instead, as the Rzentur do, to demonstrate your goodwill. Gifts of all kinds, from lowly vegetables to priceless gems to even willingly-offered brides are given to Varlengeilt, to be used to his discretion. Should it be known that Eordand recognizes Varlengeilt's spiritual authority, perhaps all of Rzenta will soon forget of our conquest?"
 eordand.23.a:0 "His hoard, however meagre, is ours to claim!"
 eordand.23.b:0 "Let us make a gift to Varlengeilt to appease his adherents."
 eordand.23.c:0 "Dragons are fearsome beasts: let us ignore them so they may ignore us."
 eordand.23.dd:0 "Perhaps a skilled burglar may steal us the most prized artifacts undetected?"
 eordand.23.e:0 "As the Rzentur have for generations, let us send Varlengeilt a bride."

 eordand.24.d:0 "From beyond the northwest mountains, a rising star brings light to the darkness of Aelantir, banishing the shadow of foreign occupation. Champions of the Fey and channelers of the seasonal magic, Eordand has risen to the position to reforging a state worthy of succession to the Precursors of old. Will we join them in victory, or will we wait for their inevitable defeat?"
 eordand.24.a:0 "Together, Aelantir will stand tall!"
 eordand.24.b:0 "Invaders and imposters, that's who they are."
 eordand.25.t:0 "Response of the Ruinborn to the Empire Reborn"
 eordand.25.d:0 "Word of our mission has spread far and wide across Aelantir, inviting the Ruinborn to unite under Eordand to fend off the invaders and build a new realm. Many have responded, some eagre for protection while others cling to delusions of grandeur without our help."
 eordand.25.a:0 "They will make fine subjects."
 eordand.25.b:0 "Perhaps they will be of more use on their own."
 eordand.25.c:0 "The audacity, refusing our generous offer?"
 eordand.26.t:0 "Disputes of Rightful Ownership of the Ynnsmouth and Trollsbay"
 eordand.26.d:0 "Beneath the Ruined Cliffs, the mouth of the Ynn meanders into the Trollsbay. Where once this land was home to Boek tribes, invaders from across the sea have laid claim to these lands. Forced from their homes, the Boek ask of us to restore their former territories. But from above the Sarda have ever watched the Ynn flow over the cliff walls at Venaan's Tears, wondering where their beloved dead flowed. \n\nAll three claim ownership of the Trollsbay, but it is clear that only one can be satisfied. Will we confiscate the stolen lands from the colonists, returning them to the Boek who may walk their forest paths once more? Or will the Sarda be given ownership from Venaan's Tears to the Ynnsmouth, protecting the riverborne voyage of their dead to their afterlife?"
 eordand.26.a:0 "The Sarda have long watched Venaan's Tears from atop the Ruined Cliffs. It is natural that they inherit the lands below."
 eordand.26.b:0 "The Boek dwelt in these woods for far longer than they have struggled against the colonizers. It is only natural that they shall keep their land."
 eordand.26.c:0 "Although they come from across the sea to the east, these colonizers are no less entrenched in these lands than the Boek. They may stay, if they are loyal to us."
 eordand.27.t:0 "Deep Beneath the Armonadh"
 eordand.27.d:0 "Investigations into the subsurface of the Armonadh mountains have found vast quantities of iron ore, as well as lesser amounts of copper, gold, precious gems and other minerals. Utilizing innovative rituals that detect quantities of iron, the druids have crafted a report of where excavations should begin. But the iron ore veins do not often coincide with other mineral deposits, leading some to suggest that the need for iron is not as great as acquiring a wealth of precious materials. \n\nRegardless of the focus, the expeditions into the Armonadh should be an incredible boon to our economy. A new and plentiful source of iron will end our eternal dependence on copper and bronze. But this is not without cost: establishing infrastructure, hiring miners and professionals, disposing of rock waste, and even the usage of mages to protect the safety of the mine will all add up to an exorbitant cost. Is it worth it?"
 eordand.27.a:0 "The formations rich in Iron are our primary concern!"
 eordand.27.b:0 "Riches other than iron should be focused on."
 eordand.27.c:0 "Perhaps it is not worth it searching for a few useful rocks?"
 eordand.28.t:0 "Transformation of the Gardens of Grebniesth"
 eordand.28.d:0 "Far from their homeland, the Gardens of Grebniesth are a stark contrast to the cold northern woods of the Ynnic Valley and beyond. Like a long-lost twin of Darhan, the Grebniesther have grown an elaborate and bountiful collection of Aelantiran botany. It is with no doubt that their land is blessed with Spring, the season of regrowth! Every few years new seedlings are planted, showing new displays of dazzling flowers and fruits. With channeling the power of Spring, what shall we promote at the Gardens of Grebniesth this cycle?"
 eordand.28.a:0 "Tulips: the sheer variety of shape and hue!"
 eordand.28.b:0 "Sunflowers bless us with beauty and practicality."
 eordand.28.c:0 "Orchids, fickle and fair."

 eordand.28.l:0 "Requiring little water, Succulents are beloved houseplants."
 eordand.29.t:0 "Treasures of the Sunken City"
 eordand.29.d:0 "Behind the northernmost dam of the Ynn lies Mocvare, the once-great city of Vareped that slowly sinks into marsh before the dam. Desperate to contain the flooding of the river, the Ynnic built great dams, but did not always perform the correct amount of research into their worksites. The dam at Mocbarja, east of Mocvare, began collecting vast amounts of water behind the newly constructed dam, and now laps at the edges of the city. Many priceless artifacts and tremendous works of architecture were lost to the rising lake, and the rest of the city has not been spared from flooding and subsidence. \n\nDolindhan divers have attempted to retrieve lost treasures from beneath the lake, but to little avail. However, with our expertise in the arts of Summer druidcraft, we can breathe underwater and possibly reclaim what was lost. But Mocvare has persevered and prospered using the waters, being a great trade hub along the Ynn. Like our ports on the Sarmadfar, Mocvare has the potential to control the trade along the northern Ynn."
 eordand.29.a:0 "What is drowned may rest there: let us focus on the riches that float on the Ynn instead."
 eordand.29.b:0 "Ignore the naysayers, there is wealth to be found Mocvare!"
 eordand.29.c:0 "The Ynn is not our concern: our navy is in dire need of reform!"
 eordand.29.dd:0 "Reforms can wait: our enemy steals our birthright from before us!"
 eordand.30.t:0 "Dracball, Sword of Legend"
 eordand.30.d:0 "A sight to behold - Dracball, Slayer of Drozmagog, Sword of Legends - before me, all mine! It calls to me, a tangible sensation of eagerness and anticipation to wield it in ones hand. The metal of the deep-red blade, fashioned from a secret alloy by the Monkriok bladesmiths, is indistinguishable from bloodstains of its previous victims. With a clap of thunder, Dracball becomes encaseed with bolts of lightning. Heroes have wielded it, legends that are sung today - I can be one as well!"
 eordand.30.a:0 "Dracball is mine alone to wield! All shall fall before me!"
 eordand.30.b:0 "The temptation worries me... let Dracball rest."

 eordand.31.d:0 "Having long dwelt in northern Eordand, the Snecboth of the Winter Court are used to hardship. But in the forests and bleak iceberg-studded seas to the east, we have been reminded that other peoples are not so fortunate as us to channel the power of Winter. While it is a time of scarcity, it is important that the community is insured food and warmth. Let us extend our generosity to our greater realm, to the unfortunate Rzentur and others who shiver and freeze. \n\nA classic, the Midwinter Solstice invites the Snecboth to a great celebration in the midst of winter when the nights become long. Or Collath, the celebrated game of strategy and patience, could be hosted and taught to our subjects. But perhaps this year the celebrations should remain silent and watchmen observant, for the enemies of Winter threaten us and will meet their end in a cold embrace."
 eordand.31.a:0 "At Midwinter Solstice we shall reconnect with friends old and yet to be."
 eordand.31.b:0 "Organize the Collath tournament!"
 eordand.31.c:0 "Many who are not attuned to Winter suffer in the cold months: we must aid them."

 eordand.32.t:0 "The Antlered King"
 eordand.32.d:0 "On the outskirts of the Drevonsred forest, the great tree Amatrvo beckons once more. Akin to the fey of the Domandrod, the Amatrvo seems to speak to those who recite to it poems spoken from the heart. Naturally, the Peitar are experts of poetry due to our Eordellon heritage, allowing us to listen to its words. Amatrvo's hollows are large enough for an entire palace, which is what it served for the Drevkenuco before us. From the heart of the tree a throne has been carved, where one worthy may sit and be one with the tree, feeling with its roots and branches across the Ynn. \n\nWhile seated on the throne, one commands immense power and respect. When the Antlered King commands, so named after the majestic antlered horses of the Drevonsred forest, all listen and obey. for all know that there is no betraying the primeval forest."
 eordand.32.a:0 "The Antlered King shall listen to all in a grand audience."

 eordand.33.t:0 "The Dalairey Expedition: Help Wanted"
 eordand.33.d:0 "Searching the Dalairey Wastes is no task for the faint hearted: blistering cold, wild and tainted magical storms, acidic lakes, and worse are known to be the fates of those who have tried before. Despite these dangers, two groups have volunteered: a veteran company of Eordellonian Expeditionaries, and a group of plucky foreign adventurers. \n\nThe Eordellonian Expeditionaries claim they are suited for this task, having explored the shadowy corners of Aelantir for Precursor Relics, facing all manner of danger and emerging victorious. They accomplish this through their professionalism and arcane knowledge, each member of the expedition proficient with survival skills and able to recite solutions to innumerable situations. Meanwhile, the adventurers sell their services for gold. They make boasts of adventures, many misadventures for sure, and claim that where they're going will need their intuition and impeccable good luck."
 eordand.33.a:0 "The Expeditionaries have abundant experience with exploring Precursor ruins."
 eordand.33.b:0 "Some gold will pay for the loyalty of these adventurers."

 eordand.34.d:0 "An almost empty chamber. After all this time, some barely salvageable artifacts and a load of ice? Eordand cannot afford to be financing such a dissapointment: give me some reason to continue this expedition!"
 eordand.34.a:0 "This cannot be all there is. Dig beneath the ice and rubble until you find more!"
 eordand.34.b:0 "This site may be a dissapointment, but there may be else to discover further in the wastes."
 eordand.34.c:0 "Unacceptable. This is all you have found? Return home immediately!"
 eordand.35.t:0 "The Dalairey Expedition: Under the Ice"
 eordand.35.d:0 "After months of excavation, a tunnel has been opened up into further ruins below. The ruins above appear to be part of an old tower, the pinnacle of some Precursor site long lost beneath the Dalairey ice sheets. Ancient flagstones wonderfully crafted of unknown material poke through the ice, forming a wall to some structure beyond. Could it be the Dalaire of old, Ducaniel's cursed city? What is for certain is that the way forward is unclear. An open but warded gate has been found, sealed against intruders with magical spells that our mages fear to tamper with. The passage ahead quickly dims, but it is clear that the long-abandoned ruin was once something great, with tarnished riches lying wrecked amongst ancient debris. \n\nAnticipation and fear is tangible in the air: beyond this gate may lie the fruits of our labor, that has cost countless lives to reach. The dissapointment of the previous ruin caused great distress amongst the expedition, causing tension to spark and doubts to fester. But now our goal is certain: artifacts and riches and power lie ahead, beyond our very gaze! \n\nScratching, screeching, dripping, creaking... the noises do not stop! The diggers grow impatient, some claiming that they can hear something beyond the walls, insisting that they can dig straight through the wall! Why go through the warded gate when we can dig through the masonry? We would get there sooner too - no more nights in this shivering cold wasteland, no more nightmares!"
 eordand.35.a:0 "We must trust in our mages to undo the magical wards."
 eordand.35.b:0 "The wards may lash out if not dispelled properly, let us excavate a tunnel instead."

 eordand.36.d:0 "White snow, in front of me, behind, around, above, below, everywhere - forever! When will it end! \n\nThe expedition soon found itself beset by a terrible ceaseless blizzard, lost deep within the Dalairey Wastes. Curse whoever thought we should head further in! Huddling beside fires, the expeditionaries spit bitter curses at each other, blaming each other for their fate. The only thing certain: an impossible decision must be made if the expedition is to survive another day."
 eordand.36.a:0 "Proceeding forth into the blizzard is a dangerous mistake. We must wait, or we will die."
 eordand.36.b:0 "Waiting here will surely be our doom! The blizzard may yet never end!"

 eordand.37.1:0 "At long last, word has returned from the Dalairey Expedition... all dead, save one who returned fully mad and clutching a brazen sculpture. Speaking gibberish and in constant fear, the survivor will not recall what happened to the expedition, save that none should look for them. \n\nThe Precursor ruin discovered in the ice is long gone, save for a few scraps of debris and frozen droplets of blood. The statue, depicting a proud elf of old, is covered in scratches and pits and is eternally cold to the touch. Looking upon it, you think of the lives lost to find - this! You find yourself staring at it in melancholy for hours, before realizing that no time has elapsed at all - you are still in your office, learning of the cursed expedition and looking upon the statue for the first time!"
 eordand.37.2:0 "At long last, word has returned from the Dalairey Expedition... all dead, save one who returned fully mad and clutching a chest full of Precursor riches. Bedraggled, wounded, and melancholic, the survivor claims that they buried the rest of it out in the wastes to keep it safe... alas, they have passed from this world. As for the rest of the treasure, it was not found, but what was found was a massacre in the wastes. Brothers turned on each other, possibly slaying each other for a chance at the treasure. What could have driven them to do such an action - surely they could have all arrived back home and lived comfortably forevermore?"
 eordand.37.a:0 "Let us at least study and understand it so their sacrifice was not in vain."

Scattered bones, gnawed and teared and worse litter the entrance to the Precursor ruin beneath the ice. Bloodied knives and hacked bones... nonsensical writings on the walls. The passage beneath to the deeper ruins was caved in by the strike of a pick, a skeletal hand still clutching at its hilt. Let us never return to this cursed place."

From the Deepwoods the Wood Elves have been stewards of the forest, yet they do not follow the Fey Lords.

The trees cut and burned, squatted by Green men known as Orcs and Goblins, the Wood Elves need assistance to protect nature, imploring we aid them. But did the Fey Lords not promise us stewardship of the Domandrod and the fey-touched lands beyond? The Wood Elves know no greater allegiance. In Aelantir and the lands beyond, we will protect what is ours!"
 eordand.39.a:0 "The Domandrod was promised to us by the Fey Lords, and with their grace the Deepwoods are ours!"

The Wood Elves once more dwell in each glade, ever-grateful for our assistance - for without us, this would never have happened. The alliance between Eordand and the Wood Elves remains strong, but it is clear that the faithful fo the Fey Lords hold a stronger position. The Evergreen Pact holds true for now, but we can shape the future of the Deepwoods to something greater!"
 eordand.40.a:0 "It is time to unify the Deepwoods under Cyranvar, for the glades cannot protect it themselves."

But recently, these fishermen have discovered something quite curious: a smooth and clear substance upon the beaches after a storm. Melted by the intense heat of lightning, sheets of curious one-sided glass are produced from the sand of the beaches, quickly decorating houses in Marathmas. From the inside of one's home, one can view outside, while the Frozenglass prohibits outsiders from viewing outside. The sleepy island of Egstrel has become known across Eordand for Frozenglass, a true gem of the north."

 eordand_disaster.1.d:0 "At last, the druids and mages have sent word that their investigation into the magical anomaly within the Domancadh ruin has borne fruit: it appears that the unstable veil is a dormant portal, waiting to be opened. To where it leads is unknown, but the druids insist that the magic is stable and permanent, without risk of closing. From a safe distance you watch as the druids form a circle around the portal, beckoning and uttering arcane incantations, causing it to tear apart, leaving a jagged opening. Within moments a surface appears between the portal’s edges, wavy like a lakes surface at first but soon flattening out. An image of somewhere else soon appears, vibrant purples and oranges against sodden black stone… mesmerized by the vision, you hardly notice that two figures step out of the portal, one short and wearing a skull of an avian creature and the other tall and strong. \n\nStooped over and still looking at a scrap of moss-like paper, the avian skulled creature asks: “We seriously back in the Deepwoods again? I told’ya all that wandering around would lead us right back in a circle, didn’t I?” \n\n“Nah this doesn’t look too familiar, these ain’t the same woods,” the large tusked figure slowly utters after peering around, not noticing you and the druids. “Least there ain’t any of them pointy-eared leaf eaters ‘round here.” \n\nThe feathered skull looks up from the map, revealing beady red eyes. “This might be the first time you were ever useful, Mûg, if you weren’t saying the complete obvious facts. Come on now, make it up to me and get us some firew… hol’ on,” he points with a sharp, yellow nail towards a low wall. “Looks like someone’s stacked here some stones.” \n\n“Right, they don’t stack themselves,” shouldering his jagged axe, the big one ambles towards the wall, “lemme take a look…” \n\nThe massive figure looks at the ancient bricks, pulls one out of the ancient mortar, and throws it in the distance. An audible thud and a gasp causes the large figures eyes to open up and look for his little companion. “Somethink not right Zyt, hear that? Sounded like them pointy ears when they break a nail.” \n\n“Well I never! I don’t care if this ain’t the Deepwoods, them elves are still here!

Will Summer be honored by returning the dead to the depths of the sea? Will Autumn's role of death in the circle of life be honored with the rot of the body? Or will Winter take precedence, with the body frozen in ice, honoring the stillness and stability of the deep winter?\n\nThere is another option, that of a funeral done in the style of the Precursor ancestors.

The meagre light helps little, but as you search you notice a shadow that should be illuminated.\n\nA voice calls out to you, cold and distant yet so very close. 'Finally awake. I thought it would be proper to inform you of my actions. Someone must be killed, someone of great value to you. Blood and murder are what drives me, but what really makes it fun is letting someone chose who dies. It's your choice: hand me over a victim, or I'll choose one of my own."
 fey_alignment.3.a:0 "The safety of my realm is worth a soul..."
 fey_alignment.3.b:0 "Preposterous, I'm not handing you anything!"
 fey_alignment.4.t:0 "Questions of Loyalty"
 fey_alignment.4.d:0 "By their very nature, the Fey are capricious and fickle beings. Embroiled in constant feuds and pranks against each other, they see mortals as mere pawns that must serve their ever-changing goals. As leader of a powerful country, they expect that you pledge your loyalty to them."
 fey_alignment.4.a:0 "I pledge myself to the Seelie"
 fey_alignment.4.b:0 "I pledge myself to the Unseelie"
 fey_alignment.4.c:0 "I will not bow down, not for anyone!"
 fey_alignment.5.t:0 "An Upset Patron"
 fey_alignment.5.d:0 "For reasons unknown to you, the Fey that once called you ally and friend are livid with you and are demanding your apology for your grave misdeeds. Ever greedy and possesive for whatever they currently do not have, they demand an exorbitant compensation for your outrageous behaviour. While it might satiate them for an instant, and they might remember this gift for a day or two, the Fey will always shift their opinion of you."
 fey_alignment.5.a:0 "I will do anything, give anything!"
 fey_alignment.5.b:0 "I still don't understand what I did wrong!?"
 fey_alignment.5.c:0 "Here look, have this special brew I have, you'll like it!"
 fey_alignment.6.t:0 "Attention Seeker"
 fey_alignment.6.d:0 "The Fey are known for their extravagant and random behaviour; today a gaggling bunch of beautiful and horrifying beings have decided to party with you, helping themselves to your personal belongings. This merry celebration is cut short however, as a rather loud and especially narcissistic Fey enters the party.\n\n'Who thought to start the festivities without me! Shame on you, all of you!,' it turns their attention to you. 'You there, servant, introduce me and serve me some drink!'"
 fey_alignment.6.a:0 "And who are you? Be off."
 fey_alignment.6.b:0 "Of course, why don't you join us?"
 fey_alignment.7.t:0 "Favor of the Seelie"
 fey_alignment.7.d:0 "The Seelie, lovers of all things merry and mischevious, smile upon you. You're our favorite pet! It's high time your good behaviour is rewarded: we'd love to throw a giant party for everyone! Well, actually not everyone, of course we're not going to waste our all our best stuff with just you. Tell us your priorities, do you really expect us to make a decision?"
 fey_alignment.7.a:0 "Gifts for all are gifts for me!"
 fey_alignment.7.b:0 "Let them party and be merry!"
 fey_alignment.8.t:0 "Approval of the Unseelie"
 fey_alignment.8.d:0 "The Unseelie approve of your dedication to savagery and honor. You are henceforth invited to our next hunt, but first a boon of our appreciation. A powerful pawn could yours, one well in tune with the art of shedding blood. Or perhaps you would like your men to have the senses of wolves and the strength of bears?"
 fey_alignment.8.a:0 "Deeply loyal and deeply dangerous? How can I say no?"
 fey_alignment.8.b:0 "What is a little pride to the strength of a owlbear?"
 fey_alignment.9.t:0 "Wine under the Willows"
 fey_alignment.9.d:0 "Under the gently swaying boughs of a great willow you dine on sumptuous delicacies and fine wines with the company of beautiful men and women from far away. They say their gifts of food and wine are from farther abroad then them, true rarities. As the day draws to the end and the suns last rays cast shadows on the willow boughs, one of your companions offers you a last toast."
 fey_alignment.9.a:0 "Pour over some of that vintage, would you?"
 fey_alignment.9.b:0 "Oh, I've really had enough to eat tonight."
 fey_alignment.10.t:0 "Something in the Drink..."
 fey_alignment.10.1:0 "The morning after your feast under the willow is pleasant, compared to other hangovers you've had before. You ponder on your life so far, and realize that there's still much more to experience. Who knew true wisdom came from wine?"
 fey_alignment.10.2:0 "You awake the next day with heavy head and uneasy stomach, like a leaden weight weighing on and an earthquake rupturing. You have never felt so sick in your life, every moment agony... must have been the wine."
 fey_alignment.10.a:0 "I never knew I had such a talent for speechcraft!"
 fey_alignment.10.b:0 "Curses, the wine has bloated my tongue!"
 fey_alignment.10.c:0 "I could use another night like that again..."
 fey_alignment.10.dd:0 "Bah, another goggledy disaster of an eventide!"
 fey_alignment.10.e:0 "Give me more of that!"
 fey_alignment.10.f:0 "The Fey Mead should cure my ails!"
 fey_alignment.11.t:0 "More than a Stomach Ache..."
 fey_alignment.11.1:0 "Copious amounts of food are always accompanied by the discomfort of a stomach ache, but you feel oddly empowered. The meats seem to have emboldened you with the strength and spirit of the felled beast. Who knew such power existed?"
 fey_alignment.11.2:0 "You could hardly believe how much you ate last night, were it not for the excruciating pain you feel in you, coupled with the feeling of emptiness and extreme hunger. You feel as if starving, but try as you must you cannot eat anymore. Something in the food last night was not altogether well."
 fey_alignment.11.a:0 "I dare anyone to strike me down!"
 fey_alignment.11.b:0 "So... weak..."
 fey_alignment.11.c:0 "I can't let anyone know about this power..."
 fey_alignment.11.dd:0 "Someone needs to pay for this!"
 fey_alignment.11.e:0 "In the future, all my food MUST be prepared the way I want it!"
 fey_alignment.11.f:0 "The Fey Mead should cure my ails!"
 fey_alignment.12.t:0 "Curse of the Child"
 fey_alignment.12.d:0 "Living so close to the influence of the Fey, it is expected that tragedy strikes more often than boons. Especially favored for their mischief are loved children, for their pranks affect both the target and bring sorrow to their family. This day they have chosen your heir for their fun, causing great grief to everyone, and most importantly you."
 fey_alignment.12.a:0 "What has happened to you!"
 fey_alignment.12.b:0 "Quick, drink this!"
 fey_alignment.13.t:0 "Return of the Lost Child"
 fey_alignment.13.d:0 "Many years ago the beloved heir of your realm was kidnapped by the fey... and now they return, as if no time had transpired, preserved in the limbo of the Fey. This would normally be a cause for celebration, but this lost child claims that their deserved position as heir has been stolen from them while they were gone, and demands that they be reinstated as the one and true heir!"
 fey_alignment.13.a:0 "Welcome back! Of course I know who you are!"
 fey_alignment.13.b:0 "I will never let some runaway cur take my nation!"
 fey_alignment.14.t:0 "Season of Gifting"
 fey_alignment.14.d:0 "The exchange of gifts is an ancient ritual, involving the sacrifice of a possession and the trust that you will receive in equal kindness. Even moreso than mortals, the Fey exchange gifts with such glee that would make children look like static and glum. Today you have received an anonymous gift. It is customary that anonymous gifts are to be reciprocated in kind by depositing a gift of your own in the woods: those who deserve it will always receive it."
 fey_alignment.14.a:0 "Thank them for the wonderful gift."
 fey_alignment.14.b:0 "It is proper to reciprocate gifts in kind."
 fey_alignment.15.t:0 "Reciprocation"
 fey_alignment.15.d:0 "You decided to claim the gift for yourself without giving anything in return, going against the ancient rules of conduct. And when rules are broken, those who made them respond gleefully. The Seelie Fey are reminding you of your debt to them, demanding far more than was given to you: the life of your child and heir must be theirs. Or, you could publicly humiliate yourself by admitting your avarice, announcing to all that you are one who can never be trusted and never gives back in return. They cackle at you while you ponder this horrible choice."
 fey_alignment.15.a:0 "I suppose a gift in kind is required..."
 fey_alignment.15.b:0 "What kind of fool accepts a gift without giving back?"
 fey_alignment.15.c:0 "I'm sure you would love this drink instead!"
 fey_alignment.16.t:0 "A Plea for Alms"
 fey_alignment.16.d:0 "The poor and homeless are a constant in every society, every day a struggle for their survival, often only alive because of the kindly donation of those fortunate. While traveling through the capital with your entourage, you pass by another unfortunate soul so alike all the rest, afflicted with the wretched curses of disease and malnutrition. She begs of you for charity of a few coins so she may eat this day, surely not a second thought for one who is decorated with the wealth of a nation. You notice that hidden behind her rags an exquisite amulet that calls out to you; you must have it!"
 fey_alignment.16.a:0 "Give the poor lady some money."
 fey_alignment.16.b:0 "Who is she to even look at me?!"
 fey_alignment.16.c:0 "Guards - seize her amulet!"
 fey_alignment.17.t:0 "Rewards of Generosity"
 fey_alignment.17.d:0 "Those who do good deeds are not rewarded in kind, but know that their actions have brought ease to those who need help the most. But today, the good deed you have done will be rewarded, for hidden behind the illusion of a poor beggar was a powerful and dreadful Fey. Your generosity will be rewarded this day with a potion most desired; a Fey Mead that may shield you, once, from the ire of the Fey and their plots. It may only be used once, but you will forever remember that your generosity may one day save your life."
 fey_alignment.17.a:0 "I pray that I may never need this."

The Silmunas were the Grand Dukes of Dameria joining the Empire of Anbennar, and were the dynasty most frequently on the imperial throne - some even viewed the Silmunas as the only rightful rulers of Anbennar.\n\nThe dynasty was destroyed following the Lilac Wars, when the Grand Duchy of Dameria was dissolved after the victory of the Rose Party and the Silmunas lost their territories save for a Rose-aligned branch in Wesdam. Of the dynastic branch that once ruled the Grand Duchy, only Rogier Silmuna survived as Captain of the Sons of Dameria adventurer company.

Under the family, Lorent would become one of the most elvenized realms of Cannor, equaled only by the Grand Duchy of Dameria.\n\nLorent remained independent of the Empire of Anbennar, though eventually a Siloriel managed to be elected to the imperial throne, sparking the Lilac Wars. This would result in a victory for Lorent’s Rose Party, though several duchies under cadet houses in the Bay of Wines would break away from the Kingdom’s control.

The family were firm supporters of the House of Silmuna, ruling the duchy of Istralore within the Grand Duchy of Dameria. Another branch also rules the county of Seinathil in Esmaria, known for its musical talents more than its martial abilities.\n\nThey would be a major player in the Moon Party during the Lilac Wars, and would take on something of a leading role in Eastern Dameria after the fall of the Silmunas.

The King resided within his palace, gorging himself of feasts gathered from Centaur tributes while his warlord vassals ruled their lands unapposed, paying little more than lip service to their liege. When the Centaurs attacked the kingdom suddenly and the king fell in battle, the mighty Ziltagh rose to the throne, leading our people to victory and reaffirming the power of Maghargma over the warlords. While they may still desire their freedom, while Ziltagh rules from his throne none dare to rise against him."

 ogre.5.t:0 "The Place of the Clans"
 ogre.5.d:0 "The clans of Maghargma have long been a great boon and a terrible curse upon the land. On one hand, their close connections to the lands they rule over allow them to govern them with greater efficiency than we ever could from Maghargma. On the other hand, their loyalty is not guaranteed, as the last few centuries have shown. As we gather the greatest of the clans in the capital to announce their place in the new order of the Empire, we must come to decision as to whom the people should look to as their direct rulers."

Either we hold grand festivals of brawling and bloodsport to find the strongest within a village, granting the victor the right to the land, or we pass the villages to be ruled by prominent families in the area, effectively creating a caste of lower clans. While appointing strong warriors to rule would greatly improve the martial spirit of our people, utilizing local families would grant stability and wealth to the lands they rule over."

 xiyun.1.a:0 "He shows great wisdom."
 xiyun.1.b:0 "He has a way with words."
 xiyun.1.c:0 "He is quite adept at strategy."
 the_command.201.t:0 "The Dishonoured"
 the_command.201.d:0 "A large population of dishonoured Hobgoblins have been residing within the walls of Lapnam Amrik, fighting as sellswords and brigands to whoever granted them enough coin. They are a disgrace to our people, cravens and rats that chose to live with disgrace and flee, taking with them their tarnished character and besmirching the name of The Command. Now that their refuge has fallen to our forces, there will be a reckoning."
 the_command.201.a:0 "Good riddance."
 oniichan.4.t:0 "Meeting of the Tagharoghi"
 oniichan.4.d:0 "It is time for the meeting of the Tagharoghi to decide upon a successor. The leaders of the great Shirgrii have all gathered in Shinukhorchi to present their candidate to the Rashenbir in hopes they'll be chosen as the Rashokudei, destined to become the next sovereign over all of Azjakuma. As is customary, they've also brought gifts in the form of knowledge or gold from their temple. All that is left now is for our Rashenbir to choose an apprentice."
 oniichan.4.a:0 "The wise elder from Shinukhorchi."
 oniichan.4.b:0 "The spymaster from Chumijemoya."
 oniichan.4.c:0 "The young warrior from Ajgriijarul."
 oniichan.4.e:0 "The wealthy lord from Kabiurgarko."
 oniichan.4.f:0 "The mysterious seer from Khelorvalshi."
 oniichan.5.t:0 "Fall of Shinukhorchi"
 oniichan.5.d:0 "The grandest of all the Shirgrii, Shinukhorchi has stood since time immemorial as the capital of our people. Now we must despair, for the ancient citadel has been wrested from us by our enemies, the wise sages of the temple have scattered to the countryside and the remaining Shirgrii. The future of Azjakuma appears bleak."
 oniichan.5.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 oniichan.6.t:0 "Fall of Chumijemoya"
 oniichan.6.d:0 "The hidden temple of Chumijemoya has fallen, the inhabitants slaughtered as they tried to hide the secret documents and scrolls housed within. Already the survivors have joined the remaining Shirgrii, plotting the restoration of their bastion. The future of Azjakuma is uncertain."
 oniichan.6.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 oniichan.7.t:0 "Fall of Ajgriijarul"
 oniichan.7.d:0 "Many armies have tried to destroy Ajgriijarul, and just as many have faltered and become just another bloodstain on its walls. Today though, the citadel has met its match. They fought with ferocity and bravery, not giving up an inch of their home without a fight. Though most of the warriors fell in battle, the few survivors have scattered throughout the countryside, angrily assaulting all that approach them. The future of Azjakuma hangs in the balance."
 oniichan.7.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 oniichan.8.t:0 "Fall of Kabiurgarko"
 oniichan.8.d:0 "The shining walls of Kabiurgarko have been stained with blood as our enemies have rampages through its halls, looting its great vaults and desecrating its grounds. The few that managed to escape have flocked to their sister Shirgrii, zealously scheming the reclamation of their wealth. The future of Azjakuma is dark."
 oniichan.8.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 oniichan.9.t:0 "Fall of Khelorvalshi"
 oniichan.9.d:0 "The restored Shirgrii of Khelorvalshi has fallen once again, invaders storming its blackened halls and attempting to breach into the forbidden vaults. The Oni within the temple seem to have vanished, disappearing without a trace as the gates were blown open. Wherever they went, their taboo wisdom is no longer at our disposal. The future of Azjakuma is unknown."
 oniichan.9.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 oniichan.10.t:0 "Shinukhorchi Restored"
 oniichan.10.d:0 "In a grand battle that will surely be remembered for eternity, our fallen capital of Shinukhorchi has finally been reclaimed. Never again shall her walls be desecrated by the unworthy, her grounds disgraced by barbarians. Already the sages and monks that were forced to flee have returned to the citadel, and damned be us all should it fall again."
 oniichan.10.a:0 "May her fires never be snuffed again!"
 oniichan.11.t:0 "Chumijemoya Restored"
 oniichan.11.d:0 "Thanks in no small part to the plotting and plans of her rightful inhabitants, the hidden temple of Chumijemoya has been pried from the hands of our enemies. The damage from the battle is already being repaired as the temple's inhabitants take stock of the scrolls housed within, destroying any that may have been read by the occupiers."
 oniichan.11.a:0 "Hopefully it won't take too long."
 oniichan.12.t:0 "Ajgriijarul Restored"
 oniichan.12.d:0 "The moment the gates were opened, they appeared from the mists, the enraged warriors of Ajriijarul. Shoving past our armies they tore into their restored home, eager to seek revenge on those that stole it from them. They may be busy for quite some time, and the citadel will surely need cleaning, but at long last we have regained the Shirgrii."
 oniichan.12.a:0 "They'll settle down eventually."
 oniichan.13.t:0 "Kabiurgarko Restored"
 oniichan.13.d:0 "Across Azjakuma are celebrations as the golden gates of Kabiurgarko lay within our hands once again. Assisted by human agents within the citadel, our armied took it with minimal damage to the structure, much to the delight of the inhabitants that have swiftly returned to their vast stashes of wealth."
 oniichan.13.a:0 "Let the gold flow!"
 oniichan.14.t:0 "Khelorvalshi Restored"
 oniichan.14.d:0 "When we stormed back into Khelorvalshi we were expecting an occupying force. Instead we were met with the original Oni inhabitants, carrying on as if nothing had happened and claiming that they had always been there. Whatever the case, the secrets of Khelorvalshi are now ours once again."
 oniichan.14.a:0 "I have many questions."
 
 akan_flavour.1.t:0 "The Prince of Khasa"
 akan_flavour.1.d:0 "When the kingdom of Khasa fell in 1438, the last surviving member of their royal house, an infant by the name of Bashal Keskhasa, was taken away by his retainers from his kingdom's burning capital to a royal estate nestled within the mountains. They swore fealty to our kingdom in return for protection from the gnolls, and the young prince has grown into a strong and ambitious young man. Today he has approached our officials in the capital with a radical proposal. He notes how difficult the decision to crown a foreign monarch king of Deshak was, and offers himself to be our ruler.\n\nThis is quite a bold request, and accepting it would surely lead to war with our overlords, though it may be our only chance at freedom. Likewise, he seems to have his heart set on this gamble, and we aren't quite sure what he plans to do if we reject him. Another option would be to gently turn down his offer but grant him his family's estate to do with as he pleases."
 akan_flavour.1.a:0 "He's a mad prince of a fallen kingdom, begone."
 akan_flavour.1.b:0 "Perhaps it is time for the prince to become a king."
 akan_flavour.1.c:0 "Refuse him gently, and grant him his estate."
 akan_flavour.2.d:0 "The young prince of Khasa, spirited away from his falling kingdom just a scant few months after his birth in 1438, has grown into a strong and ambitious young man, raised in his family's estate in the mountains of Akan and vassals of our fiefs in Deshak. He has remained loyal, if vocal about his displeasure of our rule over his adopted kingdom.\n\nToday however, we have received worrying reports that he has petitioned our officials across the sea to crown him king of the Desha, an act that would not only undermine our own rule, but surely drag us into war. Though we are confident our loyal subjects will make the right decision, there is a nagging suspicion that they may very well take him up on his offer and rebel."
 akan_flavour.2.a:0 "Worrisome"
 akan_flavour.3.d:0 "When we destroyed the kingdom of Khasa decades ago, we were sure that we had hunted down every last member of their royal family, ensuring they wouldn't have a force to rally behind. How much of a shock it was to us then, to find that a prince had not only survived, but had gathered an army in an attempt to revive his ruined kingdom. His army swept through the old capital, seizing it within the night. Though he may have won this victory, it is but a small price to pay to see the last scion of the Khasani flayed before us."
 akan_flavour.3.a:0 "We'll correct our mistake soon."
 akan_flavour.4.d:0 "It has been but a few decades since our kingdom was destroyed, ravaged by those savage beasts from the sands. They thought us defeated, conquered...enslaved. They believed they had broken us. Today is the day we prove them wrong. The last prince of Khasa, the great lord Bashal Keskhasa, has become the new symbol of Khasani freedom, a savior promised to us by Mother Akan herself to lead us out of this dark era. At the head of an army of proud Khasani warriors, he is prepared to reclaim his kingdom and rescue his people, no matter the cost. Today, Khasa rises anew."
 akan_flavour.4.a:0 "Khasa Irtisi!"
 akan_flavour.5.d:0 "When we destroyed the kingdom of Khasa decades ago, we were sure that we had hunted down every last member of their royal family, ensuring they wouldn't have a force to rally behind. How much of a shock it was to us then, to find that a prince had not only survived, but had gathered an army in an attempt to revive his ruined kingdom. Today he stands at the head of a great host, promising them with vitriol and great energy that he shall restore his fallen kingdom and expel us from Akan. While these may be bold promises, he appears more than willing to back them up with steel and fire."
 akan_flavour.5.a:0 "The boy has teeth."
 akan_flavour.6.t:0 "The Boy who was Denied"
 akan_flavour.6.d:0 "As we knew they would, our officials have refused the prince's radical proposal, forcibly expelling him from the capital. He seems to have taken the news quite harshly, gathering a great host of angry Khasani refugees and brigands. Thankfully it seems his hatred towards the gnolls is greater than his hatred of us, as he has made his intention to invade the gnollish kingdom to restore his kingdom himself. We eagerly await word of his inevitable demise."
 akan_flavour.6.a:0 "Good riddance."
 akan_flavour.7.t:0 "The Boy who would be King"
 akan_flavour.7.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the Desha have accepted the Khasani prince's request, crowning him their king and taking up arms against us. The accursed usurper Bashal is already driving his armies into a frenzy with vitriolic speeches, and turning the Desha people as a whole against us. This will be a bloody affair."
 akan_flavour.7.a:0 "Ungrateful traitors!"
 akan_flavour.8.t:0 "The Boy King"
 akan_flavour.8.d:0 "An entirely unexpected decision was made by our magistrates in Deshak. While they refused his offer of becoming king, they have instead granted him his family estate to use as he wills it. While this may not have been foreseen, or even desired, time will only tell what such a decision will bring for the future."
 akan_flavour.8.a:0 "We can only wait and watch."
 akan_flavour.9.t:0 "King Bashal I of Khasa"
 akan_flavour.9.d:0 "The lost prince of Khasa, Bashal Keskhasa, stands victorious over the gnolls of Viakkoc. Across his kingdom lie the signs of fierce combat, proof that he has earned his throne. As he triumphantly takes his seat in his ancestral palace in Khasa, he surveys his realm with glee. It quickly fades as he remembers those that wronged him and his people, the fiendish gnolls and the spinless Desha, worst of all the opportunistic curs in Eborthil. The only way for the Akani people to truly thrive is under the banner of Khasa."
 akan_flavour.9.a:0 "Khasa rises anew."
 akan_flavour.10.t:0 "The Unlikely King"
 akan_flavour.10.d:0 "Incredibly the young prince Bashal has attained victory over the gnolls, reestablishing his powerful kingdom and turning his eyes elsewhere. Namely, towards us, who he sees as rivals and cowards for refusing to support him. Wherever he leads his kingdom, we have a new and fearsome rival in Akan."
 akan_flavour.10.a:0 "How unexpected."
 akan_flavour.11.t:0 "The King of Khasa"
 akan_flavour.11.d:0 "We knew that this would not be a simple feat to accomplish, which makes it all the more gratifying that we have. The banner of Khasa once again flies proudly over the capital, who's inhabitants cheered and roared in jubilation at the return of Prince Bashal. Except today he is no longer a prince, today he becomes a king, destined to be the greatest Akan has ever seen. Khasa had fallen far, but that just means we have further to rise."
 akan_flavour.11.a:0 "This is only the beginning!"
 akan_flavour.12.d:0 "We have received word from Khasa, the young prince Bashal has become a king! In a conflict worthy of legend, he has vanquished the beasts that demolished his kingdom and cruely enslaved his people. Across Akan he is seen as a living legend, the champion of Mother Akan and the future king of all the Akani. Time will only tell what kind of lord he will be."
 akan_flavour.12.a:0 "Good for him!"
 akan_flavour.13.d:0 "We almost couldn't believe the missive when it arrived, however the seal of Khasa is unmistakable. The bold young prince, who arrogantly presented himself in Deshak to sieze the throne, has instead succeeded in reclaiming his kingdom. While much of Akan worships him as a savior and a champion of their goddess, it is clear that Khasa will not go gentle into that good night."
 akan_flavour.13.a:0 "Incredible..."
 akan_flavour.14.d:0 "How. How could a lost prince, banished from his kingdom and raised in the mountains have done this? Across Akan our packmates lie dead or dying, and few that remain are without scars or grievous injury. All of the work of Viakkoc the Mighty, undone in an instant. Much of the pack now looks at us with confusion and hatred, and the future of Viakkoc is all but certain."
 akan_flavour.14.a:0 "How could this have happened?!"
