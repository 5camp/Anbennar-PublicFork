 artifice_events.1.d:0 "Artificery involves an incredible amount of experimentation and hypothesis to simplify the once unknowable field of magic from a matter of will and belief to scientific fact. There are three broad schools of thought, or philosophies, in how to approach artificery.\n\nThe Philosophy of Brilliant Inventions focus on crafting wonderous devices that go beyond what was thought possible.\n\nThe Philosophy of Techno-Thaumaturgy see artificery as a new school of magic, using artifice to replicate spells without the need of complex rituals and reagents.\n\nThe Philosophy of Mechanism are engineers and craftsmen who combine artifice and traditional engineering know-how to push the limits of machinery.\n\nSupporting one of these philosophies will determine what Invention the Artificers hired by our state will create for us."
