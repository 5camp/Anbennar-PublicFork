 artifice_events.1.d:0 "Artificery involves an incredible amount of experimentation and hypothesis to simplify the once unknowable field of magic from a matter of will and belief to scientific fact. There are three broad schools of thought in how to research artificery and more importantly, what to create, and as the state we can support the efforts of one of these schools of thought for the duration of this research period.\n\nThe Guild of Brilliant Inventors focus on crafting wonderous mechanisms that go beyond what was thought possible.\nThe School of Techno-Thaumaturges, or Technomancers, are mages who have embraced artificery as a new school of magic, using artifice to replicate spells without the need of complex rituals and reagents.\nThe League of Mechanists and Tinkerers are engineers and craftsmen who combine artifice and traditional engineering know-how to push the limits of mundane machinery.\n\nWhile our support will greatly influence what wondrous invention the Artificers will come up with, we do not directly influence their work, so the result may not belong within the school we supported."

Brilliance school artificers see themselves as the peak practicioners of the science of artifice. Their most prominent invention is the Sparkdrive rifle, being typical of their approach to artifice by blending technology and magic to create something entirely new and all the more capable."

Creating inventions whose effects would not be out of place in a typical mage's university, artificers of the Technomancy school borrow many of the time tested techniques and methodology of academic wizards. Their most famous invention is sending stones, placing what was once rare and difficult magic into a mass produced form capable of causal use."

While they do not disdain some of the more fantastical applications of artifice, they believe that artifice should be as mass produceable as possible, and that grounding it in practical engineering is the path to truly groundbreaking inventions. The school takes its name from the praxis of it's most famous invention, skyships, which shows the sort of things that can be achieved with the school's engineering focused approach."
