 mystic_accord:0 "Mystic Accord"
 mystic_accord_religion_desc:0 "The ancient and spiritual faith that used to dominate Haless before the rise of the Righteous Path, and is now only found in the place of its supposed origin, the Lupulan Rainforest plus small pockets of Bomdan and the Ringlet Isles. The Mystic Accord, in the simplest of terms, is the complete symbiotic union between people and the spirits scattered all across Haless. Unlike the Righteous Path which has evolved to separate man and spirit, the Mystic Accord holds on to the belief that humans and spirits are equal in terms of treatment. Many of the Great Spirits represent notable geographical locations or abstract features, such as the sky or the Lupulan Rainforest. The followers of the Mystic Accord depend on these Great Spirits, split between the 4 pantheons, to protect and guide the people throughout their lives, and perform many rituals to offer thanks to them."

 desc_hujan_dip_aspect:0 "Hujan is a lesser revered spirit, its destructive nature alienating it both to its fellow Great Spirits and the people of Haless. It is Hujan, the Great Monsoon, who floods Haless, and while its flight takes it across the continent it has most of its temples and rituals from the Yanglam or Gataw people. The rare few who do worship Hujan are able to utilize the monsoon as the ideal time to attack a nation while the rains fall or put down rebels while they believe no authority would attack them during the floods."

Hengda Bowu, a spirit who emphasizes perfection of the body, and therefore many of its followers become self taught warriors who train alone in the shrouded hills of the Xianjie.

 desc_gehet_ketine_dip_aspect:0 "One of the newer spirits that had its worship started around 930 AA, with the formation of a tribal federation called Sirtan. Its followers are mockingly called the cult of Gehet Ketine by those in the Lupulan, but the Sirtana people stay faithful to the desert who has given them protection on raids. While many who wander in Gehet Ketine die from fierce sandstorms or dehydration, the followers in this nation not only can control the sandstorms to easily ride through the desert, but can influence the timing of their raids to disappear into the sands by the time any enemy reinforcement army marches in."

Among the people who live along the river, seeing a black swan is a fell omen, usually signifying another trading vessel being tossed beneath her waters. Springing from the same source as her sister river, the Telebei, the river is worshiped by any who have cause to brave her waters."

 mystic_accord_events.1.t:0 "Entering the Whirlpool"
 mystic_accord_events.1.d:0 "Aboard a ship sailing around the Lupulan Peninsula, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was struck by a desire to stop at an isolated island they were passing by. Stepping off the ship onto the warm sands, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] felt a sudden rumbling from the island’s heart. It shifted, then, with a steady inevitability, began to rise from the ocean, revealing, buried beneath the sand, a soft, rubbery skin. A great eye opened beside the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], its unknowable molluscoid depths searching for a response."
 mystic_accord_events.1.a:0 "Cinulau, who is the whirlpool, hold me in your embrace."
 mystic_accord_events.2.t:0 "The Jungle Crouched, Humped in Silence"
 mystic_accord_events.2.d:0 "Traveling through the Lupulan Jungle at the head of an army, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was waylaid by the sound of a distant, rumbling step. Ordering the column to halt, they waited with apprehension as the noise approached. Then, emerging with gentle care from the jungle wall came the shape of an enormous monitor lizard. Its reptilian gaze seemed to see only the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], still atop their oddly calm horse. With the same slow movement, it reached forth a clawed foot, extending a single long digit towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s forehead."
 mystic_accord_events.2.a:0 "Lupulan, maker of kings, bless me this day."
 mystic_accord_events.3.t:0 "Wicked Dreams Abuse the Curtain’d Sleep"
 mystic_accord_events.3.d:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s sleep has been disturbed as of late, plagued with dark visions and otherworldly whispers. Even the attending healers could not dull the furor of the dark dreams, they could only sit by and wipe the sweat from their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s brow. After a month of dark ringed eyes and fitful sleep, the source of the nightmares revealed itself. A statue, monstrous in size and appearance like man half transformed into a beast, ridged with shards of black obsidian. The statue’s mouth yawned wide, demanding blood from the sleeping [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 mystic_accord_events.3.a:0 "Reach inside a hand, slicing it against the volcanic teeth."
 mystic_accord_events.4.t:0 "Night on the Mountain"
 mystic_accord_events.4.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] was awoken from his sleep by a rumbling from deep within the earth, gentle as a lover’s touch, and no less insistent. They rose, drawn into the garden beyond the bedroom window, clambering through it with a strange abandon. There, waiting regal in its azure gown, stood a peacock. It gave a single, forlorn cry, then fixed its gaze upon the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], waiting for a signal of accession."
 mystic_accord_events.4.a:0 "The Great Peacock Phokhao will have his pact."
 mystic_accord_events.5.t:0 "The Dead Tree Gives No Shelter"
 mystic_accord_events.5.d:0 "Lost in dreams, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wandered through a fatally dry desert for weeks, with neither sustenance or succor. As their dream-self began to finally dessicate from thirst, they collapsed beneath a dry, shadeless tree, its branches clutching like gnarled hands towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s painfully slow death. From the stones before their eyes emerged a scorpion, a small creature with a bulbous tail swaying under its own weight. It crept across the broken earth, crawling onto the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s hand. There, it paused for a moment, staring with its many implacable eyes, stinger hanging over bare skin."
 mystic_accord_events.5.a:0 "Gehet Tekine, I accept your gift of venom and swift death."
 mystic_accord_events.6.t:0 "Come in Under the Shadow of this Red Rock"
 mystic_accord_events.6.d:0 "The Demon Hills are treacherous, wont to shift and rupture at the slightest trespass, their temperament only growing more restless since they’ve been freed from the Oni. While traveling to one of our fortified outposts within the Hills, the earth beneath our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s feet opened, plunging them down a narrow shaft into a cavern. The gloomy stoneshod cave was lit with a dim, pulsing light emerging from a twisting, matted knot of dark energy. As they moved closer, the energy began to move with frenetic desperation, squirming and writhing. The chain the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now saw binding it to the cave’s floor was taught, ready to snap. All it would take is a single swipe of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s sword."
 mystic_accord_events.6.a:0 "Free this mote of vengeful Hokuma."
 mystic_accord_events.7.t:0 "Into the Dark River"
 mystic_accord_events.7.d:0 "While on a riverboat sailing down the silt-dark Hukai, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was enchanted by a black swan paddling a gentle course upstream against the river’s fierce current. So taken was the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by the strange swan that, as they made their way to the ship’s rail, they barely noticed the lurch of the waves that sent them off the boats side and into the dark, hungry waters of the Hukai."
 mystic_accord_events.7.a:0 "Reach a hand towards the Black Swan Hukai."
 mystic_accord_events.8.t:0 "By the Waters of Telebei I Sat Down and Wept"
 mystic_accord_events.8.d:0 "Sitting upon the banks of the gentle Telebei in contemplation, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was all at once overcome by a deep and resonant emotion, somewhere between joy and mourning. Tears began to stream down their face, the taste sweet upon parched lips, like the waters of the river itself. Through blurred eyes they looked out over the wide water where a furrow was being wrought upon its surface by a slowly approaching turtle.  Reaching the banks it scooped itself from the river and onto the sandy bank, staring with golden eyes at our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 mystic_accord_events.8.a:0 "Oh Gentle Telebei, wash the tears from my cheeks."
 mystic_accord_events.9.t:0 "Which I am Forbidden to See"
 mystic_accord_events.9.d:0 "While on a hunt in the hills of Xianje, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] became separated from their party. Before they could turn to catch up with the rest of the procession, a thick, impenetrable fog had risen from the damp earth. Then, in the mist, figures began to twist and dance, ephemeral as light on steam. One, standing still amongst the moving shapes, beckoned for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. One of the hunters, perhaps? No, its form wasn’t quite human. Yet still it seemed to draw the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] towards it."
 mystic_accord_events.9.a:0 "Follow Hengdu Bowu into the deep mists."
