 mystic_accord:0 "Mystic Accord"
 mystic_accord_religion_desc:0 "The ancient and spiritual faith that used to dominate Haless before the rise of the Righteous Path, and is now only found in the place of its supposed origin, the Lupulan Rainforest plus small pockets of Bomdan and the Ringlet Isles. The Mystic Accord, in the most simplest of terms, is the complete symbiotic union between people and the spirits scattered all across Haless. Unlike Righteous Path which has evolved to separate man and spirit, the Mystic Accord holds on to the belief and humans and spirits are equal in terms of treatment and worship. Many of the larger spirits involve notable geographical locations or abstract features, such as the sky or the Lupulan Rainforest. The followers of the Mystic Accord depend on these large spirits to protect and guide the people throughout their lives, and perform many rituals to offer thanks to them."

 #Less organized than the Righteous Path and especially High Philosphy, it is difficult for many conversions to the Mystic Accord, making it a dying faith to those who not utterly devoted.

 desc_lupulan_dip_aspect:0 "The Lupulan is the most popular spirit still worshipped to this day, due to the Lupulan Rainforest being the last major stronghold of the Mystic Accord. The Lupulan is considered the sprit who gives Yanglam kings their right to rule their lands and wage wars, and has thousands of small temples dedicated to it.

 hujan_dip_aspect:0 "Hujan"
 desc_hujan_dip_aspect:0 "Hujan is a relatively lesser known spirit, as it is mostly a spirit that people fear and avoid due to its destructive nature to those around it. Hujan is the 'Great Monsoon' who floods Haless, and while it is a general spirit it has most of its temples and rituals from the Yanglam or Gataw people. The rare few who do worship Hujan, however, are able to utilize the monsoon as the ideal time to attack a nation while the rains fall or put down rebels while they believe no authority would attack them during the floods."

 desc_gehet_ketine_dip_aspect:0 "One of the newer spirits that had its worship started around 930 AA, with the formation of a tribal federation called Sirtan. Its followers are mockingly called the cult of Gehet Ketine by those in the Lupulan, but the Sirtana people stay faithful to the desert who has given them protection on raids. While many who wander in Gehet Ketine die from fierce sandstorms or dehydration, the followers in this nation not only can control the sandstorms to easily ride through the desert, but can influence the timing of their raids to disappear into the sands by the time an enemy reinforcement army marches in."

This spirit in the past has taken on the form of a gentle swan, whose influences can still be felt in nations that have turned away from the Mystic Accord."

 desc_telebei_dip_aspect:0 "The Telebei is the smallest yet fastest rivers in Bomdan in terms of discharge by volume, and for the Bom people it is known as a particularly aggressive spirit. Some old Bom artifacts indicate that the Telebei before the rise of High Philosophy took on the form of a dolphin and quickly charged up and down the river, which its followers attempt to emulate with its aggressive military tactics. Those who worship the Telebei prefer sieging and fast charges instead of their enemies who hide behind their tall walls, in an attempt to finally destroy the temples of the High Gods."
