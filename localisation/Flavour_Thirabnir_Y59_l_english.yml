 thirabnir_event.1.t:0 "The Legacy of Lord Narai Chaiya"
 thirabnir_event.1.d:0 "Almost 5 decades ago, a young advisor to Lord Tonan Pruakong of Azkare decided to run for the Lordship of the poor and underdeveloped Thirabnir. His renown was lacking and his supporters were sparse and uninfluential. But he was a man of knowledge, that knew how to communicate his vision. \nHis reign saw the dismantling of the corrupt cliques that partitioned and exploited the state. The Sikhawlom communities received the monopoly on salt trade, bringing them back from depths of poverty. Decadent elites of the army were removed and the structures reformed, which resulted in the repelling and counterraiding of the Rongbeki. City of Adventurers became organized and cleaned, bringing back merchants to the upper Hukai. Amicable relations were established with the resurgent Baihon Xinh and the Nephrite Dwarves, guaranteeing peace basically up until recently. The changes went so fast, it all seemt like a dream. \nAnd now it was time to wake up. \n\nToday, thousands flock in silence to Yemak cementary, as they follow a sacrophagus. It is towering over the crowd, covered by a Khanvuphaim baldachim, its wooden coffin ornamented with pure silver and carried by the most beautiful steeds. The line itself reaches beyond the horizon, peasants and nobles clothed in simple robes, marching in a single rhythm of the drums, accompanied by their silent sobbing. As they reach their destination, every citizen burns the spirit paper to protect his soul while he travels to the Spirit Realm, then they leave, having finished their last audience with their beloved Lord Narai. \n\nFor seven days and seven nights, all mourn the death of the great lord of Thirabnir, before he's brought down into his final resting place."
