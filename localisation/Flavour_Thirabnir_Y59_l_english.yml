 thirabnir_event.1.t:0 "The Legacy of Lord Narai Chaiya"
 thirabnir_event.1.d:0 "Almost 5 decades ago, a young advisor to Tonan Pruakong of Azkare decided to run for the Lordship of the poor and underdeveloped Thirabnir. He wasn’t known amongst the people of Thirabnir, his candidacy was ignored by most. But he was a man of knowledge, who knew how to communicate his vision. A one man campaign, he travelled from town to town, securing patrons and following with his oratory skills. To the surprise of everyone, he managed to win. What happened made everyone believe they haven’t missed their mark.\n\nStill consolidating his political standing, the new Lord hit the ground running by dismantling of the corrupt cliques that partitioned the state and the most powerful of them - the decadent generals who were removed. With the structures of the army reformed the security of the borders was back in place, with Rongbeki raids repelled back to back to back and onward. \nWith no one to oppose his internal status quo, it was the time to make reforms. The previously exploited communities of Sikhawlom desert, the poorest area of the country, received the monopoly on salt trade, allowing them to profit off their own land and earning a fair living by doing so. The profits of the trade attracted many merchants to Haiban, the famed City of Adventurers, sparkling a new golden age for the city that was losing value against the much larger cities of Lapnam Amrik or Ma Hoang.\nAmicable relations were established with the resurgent Baihon Xinh and the Nephrite Dwarves, guaranteeing peace in every corner of the country basically up to the Hiderion’s War. \nThe changes went so fast, it all seemt like a dream. And now it was time to wake up. \n\nToday, thousands flock in silence to Yemak cemetery, as they follow a sarcophagus. It is towering over the crowd, covered by a Khanvuphaim baldachim, its wooden coffin ornamented with pure silver and carried by the most beautiful steeds. The atmosphere around it is hollow, as a queue stretching beyond the horizon followed the body on its journey. Peasants and nobles clothed in simple robes, marching in a simple drum-led rhythm, accompanied by silent sobbing came with their beloved Lord on his last march. \nAs they reached their destination, each visitor allowed a 5 minute conversation. They burn the spirit paper to protect his soul and after making their parting worlds, they leave, having finished their last audience with their beloved Lord Narai. \nThis went on for seven days and seven nights. This was how all mourned the death of the great lord of Thirabnir, before he was brought down into his final resting place."
