kheteratan_event.1.desc:0 "Khetarch Baqtkhet II has been our Khetarch since 1136, and his time as Khetarch has seen Kheterata regain much of her lost land, and has pushed back the elven threat. In 1162, he oversaw the construction of a new, stable Kheteratan government after the assassination of Jexis. The elven governors who split away from Jexis's empire after her death were easy pickings for the fledgeling state, as the local Kheteratans saw the incoming armies not as menaces and threats, but as saviors and heroes."
