 dwarven_administration_desc:0 "This country's ruling class is dominated by the dwarven race.\n\nA dwarven-ruled country is all about no-nonsense hard work. Plots and diplomatic maneuvers hold little sway under dwarven rule: it's all about holding your ground (and sometimes, how deep your purse is).\nMost infamously dwarves are stubborn to the core and hard to change, and capable of harbouring deep grudges. While they make steadfast allies, if you make an enemy of a dwarf you will have an enemy for life."
