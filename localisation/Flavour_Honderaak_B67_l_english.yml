They claim to represent a large number of Hill Gnolls who, fleeing persecution in their homeland, have fled north over the border of the Empire of Anbennar. The gnolls of the delegation publicly denounce their demonic religion and promise to adopt Anbennarian customs, kneeling before the dove throne and pleading to be accepted as subjects of the empire.\n\nThe plight of these gnolls, who would become known as the Dovesworn Gnolls, has elicited some sympathy from some in the imperial court. They believe we should allow them to create a new homeland as a member state of the Empire of Anbennar, in the provinces they now reside in. This would also help secure the southern border of the empire, they argue. Others are more sceptical, believing gnolls would never truly become civilised if left to their own devices. They advocate spreading the refugees out over the whole region of The Borders, to become subjects under already established member states of the Empire. Others still point out that these gnolls, who have a reputation as capable warriors, might be well-suited to help secure the colonial frontiers of the empire."
