 queens_throne_skewered_drake_desc:0 "--------------\nNestled deep within the Harpy Hills lies the seat of imperial Harpy power, the Queen's Throne. A colossal city built atop one of the many mountains in this region, the roost boasts four primary layers, with access between in the form of large staircases and ramps. The first; a level populated by non-Harpy subjects. Here humans, goblins and other vassal races reside and work, and it is also the primary trading hub of the roost. The second; harpy residences.  This predominantly consists of housing unwalled to the open air, allowing for easy access from the skies, with wide platforms providing ease of use for both harpies and their mates. The third; the military district. In this district one finds innumerable barracks and training grounds, the officer schools, and the garrison that cast their watchful eyes across the surrounding hills. From the skies, they can monitor for miles in every direction for threat, harassing enemy movements with easy retreat in the case of danger. The fourth and final level; the Queen's Palace and the administration. It is from here that the Queendom is run; representatives of both the flocks and the non-harpies meet and petition the Queen in these halls. This level also serves as the housing of the Matriarch and their family. All of the Queen's children born here have the chance of one day rising to the very top of the Queendom, should they be lucky enough to gain the Matriarch's favor."

Here the Harimraja sits the Lotus Throne, the Raj knowing no other capital since the coronation of Vinas II in 391 AA. Here the Raj Ministries have their offices, the hub of the great bureaucratic wheel on which political power and agricultural productivity in Rahen revolves. Here the Senapti and Prabhi and independent Rajas of Shamakhad look with awe, fear, and trepidation for the commands handed down from on high. The shining brass roofs and golden mosaics of the palace are the visible symbol of the majesty of the Lotus Throne, and those who walk its halls hold the fate of countless millions in their hands."
