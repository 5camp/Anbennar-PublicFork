 string_start_feiten:0 "§gThe fishermen of Feiten set out into the ocean as the sun rises, just as their fathers did, and just as their fathers' fathers did. Drifting through seemingly endless beds of glowing jellyfish, they have little reason to believe that their children will experience anything different. As the shore slowly recedes from view, paper lanterns released for the prior night's Jellyfish Festival strike a prominent silhouette against the lightening heavens. And in that brief moment, the thoughts of the fishermen are united as they look upward toward the mirror of the sky and wonder what it'd be like to float amongst the lanterns.§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nJaher and his Phoenix Legion's ill-fated conquest of Yanshen was - as war often is - brutal, disruptive, and destructive. As Jaher's Legions advanced along the Yanhe, many refugees dispersed south into the sparsely populated §YJellyfish Coast§!. There, they hoped that the Coast's rugged hills and hidden valleys would shelter them from the inevitable rising of Jaher's sun. It was these refugees and their descendants, coalescing after the chaos that was the ousting of the Phoenix, that formed the §YLeague of Feiten§!.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThough a relatively new entity in Yanshen, Feiten has nevertheless managed to grow rich and catapult itself into relevance off the back of mercantile power. Efforts to convert this wealth into regional influence has been mixed, however. A recent war with the southern savages of §YZyujyut§! has netted Feiten the gateway to the tea jungle, §YCuihiok§!, but this conquest came at the steep cost of most of Feiten's fleet, stolen away by the pirate queen Ping Shuang of §YPinghoi§!. To the west, the efforts of Feiten and §YTianlou§! has led to the splintering of §YXiyun§!. Even now, Tianlou and Feiten fight to imprint their influence on the fledgling §YLuoyip§!. This conflict is only exacerbated by the fact that §YTianlou§!, the jewel of Yanshen, has far and away the richest and most well-established merchant fleets this side of the Kharunyana. If Feiten wishes leave their own mark on the world, conflict with the city of temples and their entrenched eunuchs and traders is inevitable.\n\nThe city of Feiten itself lurches toward a flickering future. For centuries, the harbour had been the launching point for minor whaling expeditions by the natives of the area. Everyone knew that whale oil burned the longest and cleanest of any animal fat, and the small amount harvested with every whale hunt was perfect to use in the annual celebratory Jellyfish Festival to fill the skies with floating lanterns. But, why waste something with such interesting properties on mere toys? With Feiten looking for any advantage against its rivals, the true potential of whale oil has only just started to be realized..."

Tianlou, the city of towers, grew powerful and rich by virtue of its location at the mouth of the Yanhe and its nebulous link to the High Gods of old.\n\nBut what has been in the past does not guarantee the future. By our shrewd efforts and the cornering of several key markets, it is Feiten merchants that now dominate many cities, and Feiten merchant ships and balloons that become ever more common in the ports of South Haless and beyond. The Jellyfish Coast - formerly ridiculed as a backwater - prospers, and all can see that the future of Yanshen lies in the League of Feiten."

Doubly so for us, for the long voyages undertaken by our merchants, whether by balloon or ship, requires more salt than can conceivably be harvested from the sea. In Yanshen, it is the vast salt plains of Lake Kohai and its surrounding desert that provides most of this mineral - we must make plans to secure access to it, whether by force or by trade."

 feiten_state_whaling_expeditions_desc:0 "For centuries, small scale whaling has been a supplemental trade for many fishing villages along the Jellyfish Coast. The blubber of certain whales have long been known as a cleaner burning and superior tallow to that of any other animal or fish, but rarely utilized due to its rarity and price. This high price makes it quite attractive as a trade good - maybe it is time to organize an expedition to feel out the potential of whaling?"
 feiten_first_foray_into_the_skies_title:0 "First Foray into the Skies"
 feiten_first_foray_into_the_skies_desc:0 "Feiten has long been known for its Jellyfish Festival. What makes the Jellyfish Festival different from the dozens of other celebrations for the New Years are the hundreds of paper lanterns that get released simultaneously to light up the skies as the year rolls over. These lanterns have traditionally been lit by whale oil, a luxury only Feiten is able to afford due to the rare whale hunt.\n\nWith the nascent emergence of an entire industry centered around whaling, the design and size of these lanterns have been growing more and more ornate as whale oil becomes more commonplace. Most citizens spare no further thought beyond competition with their neighbors and showing off their wealth, but some enterprising citizens begin to wonder at the true potential of these lanterns, especially coupled with just a bit of magic... Could sustained, controllable flight be possible with a bigger payload? Say, with a human?"

 feiten_from_theory_to_practice_desc:0 "Switch paper to canvas, made of the thinnest cloth, silk preferably. The simple whale fat candle, to an engineered cradle with flame control. Finally, add a bamboo basket underneath - and the paper lantern has been transformed into what we have affectionally dubbed a Shuimu, or a Jellyfish Balloon, for how the flame luminesces as it refracts through the sheer envelope.\n\nA simple set of steps, perhaps, but going from the first prototype to this has been a long and difficult process. For now, the technology is young, barely able to carry the weight of a single adolescent, but what limitless potential! Untethered by the tug of gravity and floating through the vast oceans of the sky, the Shuimu Balloons are a fascination to all of Feiten, and rightly so. Some advisors have even started to come forth with the idea of using them to scout, a natural use of the visibility and range advantage of these balloons."

 feiten_haichapha_title:0 "Support our Diokzatgun"
 feiten_haichapha_desc:0 "Our merchants and trade ships are going further afield and carrying larger cargoes than ever before, which brings the problem of a corresponding uptick in piracy and corsairs looking to follow in the wake of the now-legendary Ping Shuang. Our Diokzatgun, specialized pirate hunters, do much to combat these constant threats, but as they only recruit from a limited pool of vetted Feiten citizens, their resources are spread too thin. Invest some of our profits back into supporting our Diotzatgun with better ships, more advanced armaments, and coastal defenses, and we can pound the pirates into submission."
 feiten_staging_grounds_title:0 "Staging Grounds"
 feiten_staging_grounds_desc:0 "Explorations to the north and south, probing around the storm, have revealed many new islands. Many, if not most, of these are rocky, wind-blasted hellscapes at risk of being drowned at any second, but there are some that seem hold promise as forward whaling bases or as resupplying bases for our ships. If we can build up infrastructure and develop these islands up, we can make great use of them yet."
 feiten_gateways_title:0 "Gateway to the World"
 feiten_gateways_desc:0 "More than ever, the fortunes of Feiten are carried on ocean waves and skyward currents. Whether serving on whaling boats bound for distant shores, or serving on balloons and carried by the vagrancies of the wind, all funnel through Feiten itself or our southern harbour of Cuihiok.

 feiten_of_guano_and_whale_oil_title:0 "Of Bird Guano and Whale Oil"
 feiten_of_guano_and_whale_oil_desc:0 "The primary thing we look for when exploring the ocean-past-the-storm are islands that can work as whaling stations -islands with a sheltered bay, wood for repairs, and ample freshwater and animals for meat. Failing those, the islands almost always teem with seabirds, who cover the rocks with many feet of their droppings. Many of the older farmers amongst the Jellyfish Coast know well the value of bird and bat droppings as fertilizer, having taken advantage of seabird nesting sites amongst the pocked cliffs and caves of the Coast since the days of their forefathers. These deposits have long been drying up coax life out of the Jellyfish Coast's poor soil, but every new island layered with guano is another boon for us."

Everyone in Feiten knows that the start of spring is the best time for whaling, for that is when the whales migrate from their winter seas back up north to their summer feeding seas. Usually, within a cycle or two of the moon, most of the whalers would have come back with their holds full of catch. In recent years, the whalers have been returning later and later, and oftentimes with hold half empty. Clearly, the old hunting grounds have been tapped out. We cannot let the whaling industry falter - we must find new fisheries, and quick!"

 feiten_mapping_storm_boundaries_desc:0 "For as long as our fishermen and sailors can remember, there has been a massive storm to our east. The storm consumes all, stretching its claws beneath the churning sea foam and rising up to swallow the very stars themselves. Local tales say that the storm will one day tire of its feast and start westward to flood the world in its entirety.\n\nTales of a more... suspicious age, of course - we know better, for every philosopher and wiseman knows that the world is round, and so the storm must peter out at some location. We do not know what lies beyond or within, but as our merchants seek new trade routes and access to more products and whaling bases, it will be important to map out the edges of storm in its entirety."

 feiten_to_man_an_airfleet_desc:0 "Serving on a balloon is best left to the young, wiry, and fearless, at least among humans. Every pound less dedicated to the weight of a person is an extra pound that can be used for valuable goods, or another cannonball. And even a short balloon jaunt is fraught with danger, with unpredictable winds ready to dash the fragile craft into a cliffside at anytime.\n\nSo, what better to man our airfleet than a kobold? With their slight build and penchant for yearning for flight, the Goldscales have proven to be reliable airshipmen by the earlier adopters of balloons among our merchants, even if they were originally only brought along primarily as good luck charms. The training and greater adoption of Goldscales must be prioritized if we want to squeeze as much advantage our of our airfleet as possible."
 feiten_aeronauts_handbook_title:0 "The Aeronaut's Handbook"
 feiten_aeronauts_handbook_desc:0 "The "Art of War", written by famed strategist Lián Zhu of Jiangdu, has been the premier military treatise in Haless for centuries. It has held steady throughout the many changing faces of war, many of its learnings relevant even today. Other parts, however, are wildly outdated with the advent of air as a third dimension of warfare. Though still respected and a required reading for any general, it is treated as more of a philosophical rather than practical work today. Our expertise as the originators of balloon and airship warfare means that we have accumulated much knowledge over the years, enough to pen an "Art of War" for the modern age that will be circulated and read as widely as the original: The Aeronaut's Handbook."

It turns out that the Cannorians have their own name for this ore: coal. Its discovery has set off quite the scramble in our foreign communities, as coal is what powers much of Cannor's nonmagical engines and inventions, while also supplementing Damestear in many magical ones. Divination has revealed large veins of 'coal' in Lougang and the surrounding areas, something that our own scholars and Shuimu Engineering Cadre are quite desperate to get ahold of for their own research and use."

 feiten_developing_an_air_doctrine_desc:0 "With the emergence of an entire new dimension - that of the air - warfare will undoubtedly never be the same. So far, we have been uncreative in our use of our balloons, mostly using them to scout and little else. Aerial scouting is nothing new, for the far-flung harpies of Fengwuzhe have been doing that for centuries. Balloons, however, do not tire as harpies do, do not require sustenance as harpies do, and can carry much high loads than harpies can, opening up an ocean of possibilities.\n\nThere are two major schools of thought championed by the Shuimu Engineering Cadre as our designs improve and balloons get more and more integrated into our forces - that of overwhelming firepower from above, and that of lightning fast army movement and flexibility."

These rumours come are almost always attached with wondrous inventions, magical trinkets, and never-before-seen artifice. They come seeking knowledge and novel technology, willing to spend a fortune to obtain it whichever cities they decide to dock their bulbous research ships in. The Shuimu Engineering Cadre are quite eager to make their acquaintance, enamored with technology as they are - perhaps their arrival can be mutually beneficial? Our Shuimu balloons will surely fascinate them, and there is no telling what we can learn from their miracles."

 feiten_field_demonstration_desc:0 "Our air doctrine has been painstakingly developed over decades, but it has been developed against the armies and navies of Haless. The Cannorians bring to bear a much more frightening form of warfare, one that we must adapt to, lest they decide that Feiten is their next target. Our new friends the gnomes may be of help in modernizing our current doctrines and technologies, provided we bring them along as observers to critique our successes and failures in war."

 feiten_university_row_desc:0 "A well-educated populace is a double-edged sword. On one hand, an enlightened population translates to a more productive workforce, better inventions and innovations, a competitive edge over those who let their peasants rot in the fields. On the other hand, thinking leads to unrest and revolution. Poor in raw materials and agriculture as the Jellyfish Coast is, the benefits outweigh the risks - we must build universities and places of learning open to all, so that we will be able to compete in thought and technology if not in raw power with the Cannorians and all others who look covetously toward Yanshen's resources."

One of the most intriguing is the discovery of nitroglycerin, a powder much stronger than the gunpowder that we have been using for centuries. To make it, we combine glycerin, a byproduct from making soap from whale oil, and purified saltpetre, which is harvested from our mines in the Jellyfish Coast as well as bird guano islands. In its raw form, the powder is extremely volatile and dangerous - to ramp up production and fully take advantage of this new discovery, we must build up facilities suited to handle and produce nitroglycerin safely."

From [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] vantage point atop the pier, the boat appears entirely too in danger of capsizing as it rolled with with the minor tides close to shore to handle a few tuna, much less the ship sized whales that were to be their quarry. Noticing [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s trepidation, the captain of the ship limps over, a slight grin on his face.\n\n    "She may not look like much, but she's served me well in over a dozen hunts. And I wager she'll serve for a dozen more."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is in the process of turning to give a grateful nod as the ocean finally wins the tug of war, a rogue wave washing over the boat's deck to a chorus of loud curses from those on deck.

Unsuccessful, it dives, and the harpoon rope starts to whip and unwind from the boat. Just as it looks like the rope will snap taut, it stops unwinding as the whale runs out of breath and starts streaking toward the surface again. The other harpoon boats take full advantage as it surfaces and lance the whale, aiming to pierce any of its vital organs. Weakened so, the whale's movements slow, until it ceases entirely.
