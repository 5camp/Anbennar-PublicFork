 league_of_feiten_desc:0 "The Shuimu League is a collective of city-states and communities along the Jellyfish Coast. The League was formed by refugees fleeing Jaher's conquest of Yanshen, taking shelter in the rugged hills and craggy cliffsides of the then sparsely populated coast. Though dominated by Feiten, each member of the league proudly retains some independence and have a fierce tradition of self-sufficiency, their origins as refugees not forgotten."
