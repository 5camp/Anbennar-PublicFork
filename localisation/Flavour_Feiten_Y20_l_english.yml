 string_start_feiten:0 "§gThe fishermen of Feiten set out into the ocean as the sun rises, just as their fathers did, and just as their fathers' fathers did. Drifting through seemingly endless beds of glowing jellyfish, they have little reason to believe that their children will experience anything different. As the shore slowly recedes from view, paper lanterns released for the prior night's Jellyfish Festival strike a prominent silhouette against the lightening heavens. And in that brief moment, the thoughts of the fishermen are united as they look upward toward the mirror of the sky and wonder what it'd be like to float amongst the lanterns.§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nJaher and his Phoenix Legion's ill-fated conquest of Yanshen was - as war often is - brutal, disruptive, and destructive. As Jaher's Legions advanced along the Yanhe, many refugees dispersed south into the sparsely populated §YJellyfish Coast§!. There, they hoped that the Coast's rugged hills and hidden valleys would shelter them from the inevitable rising of Jaher's sun. It was these refugees and their descendants, coalescing after the chaos that was the ousting of the Phoenix, that formed the §YLeague of Feiten§!.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThough a relatively new entity in Yanshen, Feiten has nevertheless managed to grow rich and catapult itself into relevance off the back of mercantile power. Efforts to convert this wealth into regional influence has been mixed, however. A recent war with the southern savages of §YZyujyut§! has netted Feiten the gateway to the tea jungle, §YCuihiok§!, but this conquest came at the steep cost of most of Feiten's fleet, stolen away by the pirate queen Ping Shuang of §YPinghoi§!. To the west, the efforts of Feiten and §YTianlou§! has led to the splintering of §YXiyun§!. Even now, Tianlou and Feiten fight to imprint their influence on the fledgling §YLuoyip§!. This conflict is only exacerbated by the fact that §YTianlou§!, the jewel of Yanshen, has far and away the richest and most well-established merchant fleets this side of the Kharunyana. If Feiten wishes leave their own mark on the world, conflict with the city of temples and their entrenced eunuchs and traders is inevitable.\n\nThe city of Feiten itself lurches toward a flickering future. For centuries, the harbour had been the launching point for minor whaling expeditions by the natives of the area. Everyone knew that whale oil burned the longest and cleanest of any animal fat, and the small amount harvested with every whale hunt was perfect to use in the annual celebratory Jellyfish Festival to fill the skies with floating lanterns. But, why waste something with such interesting properties on mere toys? With Feiten looking for any advantage against its rivals, the true potential of whale oil has only just started to be realized..."

The League was formed by refugees fleeing Jaher's conquest of Yanshen, taking shelter in the rugged hills and craggy cliffsides of the then sparsely populated coast.

 feiten_integrate_cuihiok_desc:0 "The long war with Zyujyut may have left our fleet in shambles, but we were able to wrest the port of Cuihiok from the jungle savages,at the very least. Cuihiok sits at the river mouth that is the gateway into the tea jungle, and as such, full control over it is incredibly important for our trade ambitions in the area.

Feiten's longstanding enmity with Zyujyut means that our traders and merchants face quite an unwelcoming environment when attempting to tap into the tea trade, a hostility that cannot be assuaged by even the largest sums of money that we can offer. They leave us no choice: we must enter the jungle ourselves."
