 f27_riches_of_the_hills_title:0 "Riches of the Hills"
 f27_riches_of_the_hills_desc:0 "Since time immemorial our eponymous hills have hidden great reserves of wealth, and we, the great roamers of Halann, have sought them. Few queens go without marking their own quarry, and the resources they claim simply fuel further jaunts. It is the nature of our people to be restless, however, and we know there is yet more wealth to be found in our homeland. Our talons will rake the soil a hundredth time, and from its depths bring forth brilliant things."

 f27_humans_of_the_harpy_hills_title:0 "Humans of the Harpy Hills"
 f27_humans_of_the_harpy_hills_desc:0 "Where we harpies move, humans stand. Where we speak, they fall silent. Our nature renders us natural interlocutors, the go-betweens of a hundred peoples, and yet even with our closest neighbours we struggle to find concord. The famed tenacity of these shepherds has long frustrated harpy ambition, but the terror raid has never cowed the Gelkari, merely embittered them. We are the ones who can fly and so we must be the ones to go to them. We must meet them where they are or they will never accept us. Let us make peace and hand them the tools to defend their hilltop towns forever. In so doing, we turn a new page and begin to write a story of alliance, not animosity."

 f27_plains_and_rivers_title:0 "Plains and Rivers"
 f27_plains_and_rivers_desc:0 "For every harvest scratched from the soil of the great Bulwari rivers, enough blood is spilled to replenish it twofold. We soar to power no less eagerly than the hundreds of other despots who have claimed these lands, and yet rulership is an art, practised differently from one craftsman to another. From now onwards, as long as we rule, let the blood run out with the silt; let it diffuse into the Divenhal. The scholars will write that to the greatest of temples, the rule of the harpies brought rest."

 f27_light_and_darkness_title:0 "Light and Darkness"
 f27_light_and_darkness_desc:0 "Centuries and centuries of dispute and feud: here in Inner Bulwar we find great archives of enmity, and familial memories which reach far into the sleet-fogged past. Gnolls and humans have bled one another in unfathomable numbers on these barren rocks, weaving their culture on a loom of mutual hatred. It is a simple thing, to perch in the roost of the Queen and hear their order to mend fences - it is another to actually make such a thing so. We have no choice but to turn our alien nature to our advantage. With a third set of customs, we also bring a third set of laws. The gnolls and humans will be bound equally to it, and their generational feuds formally assessed and resolved by harpy judges. The writing may take centuries, but a new page is begun."

 f27_plight_of_the_rebellion_title:0 "Plight of the Rebellion"
 f27_plight_of_the_rebellion_desc:0 "We harpies have been called deceitful, conniving, underhanded: the truth is that a Harpy Queen sees in every stranger their newest ally, and will dive over collapsing fences of propriety to make it so. Dartaxes and his rebellion of the old believers constitute one such potential ally, and a grateful one at that. They are a militarised populace brimming with resentment, who look upon our Gelkari envoys with far more friendship than the Sun Elves. We do not begrudge them their ancient faith or its practice, and we share enemies. For starters, that may well be enough."

 f27_dartaxes_claims_title:0 "Dartaxes' Claims"
 f27_dartaxes_claims_desc:0 "The exchange of spouses has been achieved; a harpy messenger may now travel unaccosted along the entire width of Bulwar. The smiles shared between our people and the old cultists are still tentative, but we are fellow outcasts in the eyes of the great elven kingdoms and have much bringing us together. Let the western wing unfurl - siblings-in-law will soon give way to cousins, a great imperial family of northern Bulwar. As in a courtship dance, such things need not be rushed."

 f27_bahar_melting_pot_title:0 "Bahar: Melting Pot"
 f27_bahar_melting_pot_desc:0 "Some are wont to call our regard for our human subjects unique: this may be so, given our long intertwining, but it is not absolute. The humans of Bahar foster a profound hostility for the goblins who swept from the Serpentspine, and no lasting harpy peace can exist while this hatred festers. As in all things, the ruler of the skies grants earthly folk dominion over their places: the goblins will have their courts, and so will the humans. It will be difficult to truly resolve such a deeply felt feud, especially given that the old land claims are in living memory, but there can be no half measures in the establishment of a new Harpy queendom. Someday soon, humans and goblins will live peacefully together in Bahar."

 f27_plight_of_the_sadnatu_title:0 "Plight of the Šadnatu"
 f27_plight_of_the_sadnatu_desc:0 "They will say of the harpies that we came at a time of blood, and stopped the flow. We have long noted with alarm the dire situation of the Šadnatu, trapped in constant struggle for independence from the gnolls, and yet the long register of Bulwari history shows us what will happen, should we intervene and allow them their revenge. Quite apart from concerns of mercy, such a revenge will breed only further unrest, and a neverending casus belli against us. These are our terms: the humans of Šad Sur will have their independence, peace and freedom. And there, with their hands on their sword hilts, we will all finally stop. The gnolls will abandon their sacrifice, and both sides will respect the rule of the harpy queens."

 f27_prosperity_after_peace_title:0 "Prosperity After Peace"
 f27_prosperity_after_peace_desc:0 "From our perches, we harpies tend to think of the world as expanses between peaks, long notes followed by rests. As the mountains of the Šadnatu have fallen under the queen’s peace, the economy has boomed, stability encouraging investment in its mineral reserves. Harpy logistics corps bring goods in and out in unprecedented volume, and the shattered infrastructure is slowly repaired. The arguments for a roost in Šad Sur are thus manifold: It is a natural administrative centre in the south, a place from which to pincer the Bulwari river plain in times of war. It is also a place of ancient history and prestige, and perhaps most importantly a proof of concept for the queen’s justice. Ours is the benevolent imperium of the skies. If we look down on our subjects, it is only because we have dared to fly."

 f27_raise_the_flocks_title:0 "Raise the Flocks"
 f27_raise_the_flocks_desc:0 "It is the fault of the parent if the children bicker, and above all our minor flocks have lacked purpose. Life, the matriarch wonders, must be about more than access to an aquifer. Lowlanders rarely understand the hidden pride of the matriarch, which can ignore the slander of outsiders but which takes extreme umbrage at the passing comment of a fellow harpy. Here in the sky we have perched among ourselves, and scratched ceaselessly at each other. No longer. Ayarallen will fly once more in formation, and our wings will blot out the sun."

 f27_queen_of_the_hills_title:0 "Queen of the Hills"
 f27_queen_of_the_hills_desc:0 "To take flight without a solid nest is madness: a simple wisdom to which we harpies more easily agree than adhere, so used as we are to our endless peregrinations. It is difficult to keep a bevy of matriarchs together and focused on a single goal, let alone over generations, and so what we have built in these highlands is all the more remarkable. Our roosts are peaceful and functional, unburdened by the internecine conflict of daughters, our discourse in the perch of the queen respectful and productive. Our talons are sharp and pointed where they should be; towards wider Bulwar, and the destiny of Ayarallen."

 f27_queendom_of_bulwar_title:0 "Queendom of Bulwar"
 f27_queendom_of_bulwar_desc:0 "Until now, we have been a claimant, one of many with ambitions to reunify Bulwar for the umpteenth time in its venerable history. Such claimants must prove their right to every inch of territory, and our envoys have flocked to every court from the Dameshead to Rahen, dissembling our ambition while quietly proving our mettle. We tiptoe no longer. Serpentspine to Divenhal, all Bulwar is in the shadow of harpy wings. What remains is simply to subjugate the river cities, making our will manifest."

 f27_the_city_of_cities_title:0 "The City of Cities"
 f27_the_city_of_cities_desc:0 "The city of Bulwar, from which an entire continent takes its name, is for us most notably a city of the lowlands. It is the lilypad on the pond, the place where a courier can land and rest before continuing south. But it is also a city of almost unfathomable ancientness, scuffed here and there from rounds of invasion, civil unrest and flooding. The benevolent rule of the Queen will see this city remade once more as a lily on the pond, the Lowest Perch of the harpy state."

 f27_bulwari_metropol_title:0 "Bulwari Metropol"
 f27_bulwari_metropol_desc:0 "The grebe settles on the water and adjusts its feathers - it seeks a tranquil lake on which to do so. The existing, ancient metropolises of the riverland make ideal perches, and we will restore and invest in these great cities, for the benefit of our human subjects and our pocketbooks alike. An adapted Roost model is suited to the Bulwari riverlands: it is a flat land stretching between fixed strongpoints, and the openness and mildness of the terrain is a force multiplier for our existing logistical strengths. It is not merely the ancient cities of Bulwar which will benefit from such investment, however. The ancient capital at Heunthume will be repaired, reorganised and expanded. Its four great levels will breathe again, a Highest Perch of all peoples."

 f27_the_fourth_and_final_queendom_title:0 "The Fourth and Final Queendom"
 f27_the_fourth_and_final_queendom_desc:0 "If there is a great mistake of harpy rule, it is an extension of our long history of elite consultation; matriarchs feel free to speak back to the Queen in the safety of the council, and every harpy of any renown maintains their own magisterial air. Such able satraps readily envision themselves as independent rulers. If we seek to maintain this grand harpy confederation we have built, we must establish a Queen among Queens, a court of grandeur, the authority and majesty of which are final and unquestionable."

 f27_the_royal_hunters_title:0 "The Royal Hunters"
 f27_the_royal_hunters_desc:0 "The fractious and warlike harpies of Nansalen draw their consorts by long tradition from the people of Akalšes, stymied only by contested dominion over the region and by the hostility of its elven rulers. We have made a claim to real hegemony over the harpies, and we more than most know that a Matriarch demands proof of the value of an exchange before she accedes to it. Let us bind the Nansalen to us by the greatest of debts - that of the village matchmaker. Nansalen shall have their husbands, and we shall have their loyalty."

 f27_stewardess_of_the_suran_title:0 "Stewardess of the Suran"
 f27_stewardess_of_the_suran_desc:0 "Mages have long been known for sacrificing the craft of good governance to their own priorities. The mages of Varamhar have treated the upper Suran as their personal laboratory, at the cost of the thousands of tenant farmers who make their cosseted lives possible. Such abrogation of their duty of care is abominable to the Queen. Though we already sought to project our influence across all Bulwar, the excesses of these mage-potentates grants us powerful added incentive and a useful casus belli."

 f27_governorship_of_setadazar_title:0 "Governorship of Setadazar"
 f27_governorship_of_setadazar_desc:0 "The blessing of Bulwar is a rich and ancient trove of history. Its greatest vice is nostalgia. None personify this fault better than the plaintive nobility of Sareyand, who have yoked the Setadazari to their endless lust for lost glory, squandering wealth and lives on a dream which is already dead. We harpies, while cognizant of our past triumphs, know that the wind ever changes. We will offer Setadazar a future that is genuinely novel, a model of life under which the Queen’s peace brings prosperity and progress."

 f27_partition_of_irrliam_title:0 "Partition of Irrliam"
 f27_partition_of_irrliam_desc:0 "We should not be surprised that the sun elves have gripped hard to their hegemony over Bulwar since the collapse of the Phoenix Empire. The realm of Taelarios claims leadership in this, and it is with some justice that our fiercer matriarchs see men like him as the cause of many of our worst misfortunes. It is the most conservative element of the New Sun Cult clergy who have championed great raids against our people. In a hundred rural temples, they make monsters of us to their congregations. We do not wish to break the Bulwari way of life, for humans or for elves, but we will not leave in place a structure which threatens us. Irrliam and the temporal power of its priesthood must be crushed and scattered like seed. We dispose of such prizes as we will."

 f27_suran_under_wing_title:0 "Suran Under Wing"
 f27_suran_under_wing_desc:0 "We fly over a ribbon of turquoise, trimmed in mint and moss and chartreuse. Beyond is ochre, yellow and white. In places the ribbon tears, its scattered fabrics littering the emptiness. Thirty minutes do not pass before one again comes across a great geometric growth reaching out from the ribbon, flanking the turquoise in great studded wings of mud-brown. Here and there, deep jade and forest green speckle the feathers - the famous gardens of the Bulwari. Even now, landing towers and skytaverns shoot up at the centre of Bulwari market towns, linking the source of the Suran to its mouth so seamlessly that our strongest fliers can make the trip alone in under a week. It is said that sovereigns rule over their lands. We will make this unusually literal."

 f27_the_odd_hunters_title:0 "The Odd Hunters"
 f27_the_odd_hunters_desc:0 "We have feuded with the Hytiranyalen since long before their expulsion east by the hated Beastbane. Among ourselves, we sourly jest that the worst of his crimes was sticking us with this most baffling and irritant of flocks. The Queen’s vision sees beyond petty rivalry, however, to a future greater than pride. Thus the matriarchs of Hytiranlen were taken at their word when they mockingly demanded the city of knowledge itself. The joke will be on them, however. Aqatbar is no mere scholar’s garden; it is a path to the Divenhal and a difficult place to manage. Let these odd ducks rifle through their tomes, so long as they open the west for our queen."

 f27_harpys_road_title:0 "Harpies Road"
 f27_harpys_road_desc:0 "Since the opening of the archives of Aqatbar, the Hytiranyalen have delved eagerly and deeply into its reserves of knowledge, more and more of their senior matriarchs taking up permanent residence in spires close to the library itself. From such hallowed halls flow new ideas of governance and statecraft, new standards, new imperatives. The matriarchs are arguing that no true Harpy governance can flourish without a network of rest towers, without proper roads for our human freight caravans, without the adoption of standard weights and measures. No longer will the harpy lands be Bulwar’s backwater; from the Serpentspine to the Divenhal, the Queen’s peace will guarantee wealth."

 f27_links_to_the_north_and_east_title:0 "Links to the North and East"
 f27_links_to_the_north_and_east_desc:0 "We are people of the open sky, who nest by the mountains. Projecting power east over the Serpentspine is a pointless endeavour that would land us in neverending conflict with the Centaurs while stranding us far from home. The Serpentspine’s caves promise only claustrophobic misery and yet more death. Even the forests of the north offer only a sea of endless green in which to drown. No, these places are best appeased, by the greatest harpy diplomacy we can bring to bear. Goods, services, people, ideas; we will open to them all, and in doing so render ourselves all the richer."

 f27_the_first_of_the_temples_title:0 "The First of the Temples"
 f27_the_first_of_the_temples_desc:0 "It will be said that we harpies scorned the desert and brought order where even Surael’s chosen could not. Here in the holiest place in Bulwar, we send a message manifold and subtle in its variations. To our human and elven subjects, we assert ourselves as the only competent guardians of their ancient religious treasures. Jaddar and Zokka we denounce as petty warlords, fit only to spill blood where our Queen builds peace. The harpy spires at Eduz Vacyn will be the grandest ever seen, a record of our victory."

 f27_the_bulwari_under_wing_title:0 "The Bulwari Under Wing"
 f27_the_bulwari_under_wing_desc:0 "Even the most idealistic Harpy Queen must forgive their human subjects a little cynicism - the Bulwari, after all, have had one alien conqueror after another wash over them. Such conquerors have enslaved, patronised, enraptured, laid waste; resistance was thus to be expected when we swept in. No ruler of Bulwar has ever offered autonomy in the manner we have, however. The participation of humanity in the project of Harpylen is no platitude. Humans rise to genuine political influence with greater frequency than under any previous Bulwari administration, and disproportionately thrive in our officer corps and civil service. For Cannorians, Escanni, and Raheni alike, the face we show the world is now as often human as it is harpy - by design, of course."

 f27_many_ports_many_people_title:0 "Many Ports, Many People"
 f27_many_ports_many_people_desc:0 "Our human clerks know western Bahar well: it is a craggy outcrop which prefers the ferry to the cart, and which has been much assailed by revolution, struggle and invasion. But it is also a place of tragedy for we harpies, the peninsula from which the Hytiranyalen flock were once driven by the cruelties of Castan II Beastbane. Ovdal Tûngr, Crathano, Bal Ourd and Re-Uyel are as such barely foreign cities to us, tightly bound to the economic fortunes of the Bulwari Main and with great meaning for many of our people. Let us bring the Bahari in from the cold, and guard our western door even as we make new paths to the sea."

 f27_monsters_no_more_title:0 "Monsters no More"
 f27_monsters_no_more_desc:0 "Monstrousness is a question of perspective, and a question of tradition. What the Bulwari have been wont to call monstrous is related more to administration and organisation than true nature. We harpies, so often cast as the villains of bedtime stories, know this only too well. There are two true monsters left in the fairytale pages of the Salahad: the gnoll slavers, and our Siadunan sisters to the east. We will bring them under our sway and prove that old drawing room retort - civilisation is simply what happens when one learns to pay one’s taxes."

 f27_twin_rivers_bounty_title:0 "Twin Rivers Bounty"
 f27_twin_rivers_bounty_desc:0 "It is the harpy way to connect things. We move between spaces, filling them, mapping them. Is it so strange, then, that we seek to bring the same to our subjects? Humans believe that the key to prosperity is ambition, elves claim tradition, goblins cunning, gnomes technology; they are all wrong. Prosperity is logistics. Under Harpylen, the great arterial rivers of Bulwar have become superhighways for goods. Harpy couriers and entrepreneurs flit from city to city, resting in well-maintained skytaverns which now mark the horizon in every town for a thousand miles. Complex chains of industrial production are rendered trivial by fast-moving barges, human-manned delivery carpets and vertically integrated regional exchange hubs. Once we made great capitals of our roosts; now every town of Bulwar is such a roost."

 f27_the_matter_of_faith_title:0 "The Matter of Faith"
 f27_the_matter_of_faith_desc:0 "We call ourselves peacemakers, yet with our sovereignty over all-Bulwar, still the question of confession remains. As we struggled to unify the Harpy Hills, we brought the old believers into our alliance; since then, we have conquered great swathes of Bulwari territory, dethroned the sun elves and denied Jaddar his claimed destiny. Yet still the people roil and fight. There is nothing to be done but to call a conclave of our own, settle the debate and establish a religious settlement along the Twin Rivers."

 f27_twin_rivers_enlightenment_title:0 "Twin Rivers Enlightenment"
 f27_twin_rivers_enlightenment_desc:0 "We have been accused of mercenary faith, as if to value consensus and tolerance is a vice. The work of Surael is in the mending, and in our compromise position we have healed the worst scars of Bulwari religious discord, uniting the people in reverence. The Queen’s peace is not merely the absence of war; it is the harmony we see now, spreading out from the Suran and Baranun like the life-giving floods of spring."
