 rahen_corrupt_court:0 "The Corruption of the Dhenijansar Court"
 
 rahenraj.0.t:0 "The decadence of the Raj"
 rahenraj.0.d:0 "The court of the Raj has been growing more and more powerful and corrupt. At this point, the Raja has little control over the country and his feuding subjects have gone to war with one another trying to consolidate their power. If the court is not heavily reformed, then the Raja faces a continual downward spiral, until it is ultimately overthrown by one of its many power-hungry subjects."
 rahenraj.0.a:0 "We need reform"
 rahenraj.1.t:0 "The Raja Has Fallen!"
 rahenraj.1.da:0 "Dhenijansar has fallen, and with it, the old Raja! Across Rahen, former enemies and allies alike acknowledge us as the new leader of the harimraj. As much as things change, however, things stay the same, Prabhis and Senaptis bicker and squabble, harimari and Humans still struggle to get along, and trade still flows upon the Kharunyana, but for once, it is us who sit upon the throne in Dhenijansar."
 rahenraj.1.db:0 "Dhenijansar has fallen, and with it the Harimraj! Across the lands of Rahen, former Prabhis and Senaptis now stand as independent states, without the old Raja to tie them down. However, as much as things change, things stay the same, and across Rahen, various Raheni and harimari states are at each other’s throats, once more vying for supremacy over their corner of Rahen. However, with Dhenijansar in our hands, although we make ourselves a large target, they have no chance of defeating our mighty armies. One thing is for sure however; Rahen will never be the same again."
 rahenraj.1.aa:0 "We are the heirs to the Harimraj"
 rahenraj.1.ab:0 "An era comes to a close"
 rahenraj.2.t:0 "A Senapti Falls"
 rahenraj.2.d:0 "Though we have most loyally and faithfully served the Raj for many years, our nation simply isn’t what it once was. Over time, we have fulfilled less and less of a role in the Raj, and other Senapti have begun to take more and more of the stage. As such, the Raj has seen fit to demote our great nation.\n\nWe are no longer Senapti; now we are Prabhi."
 rahenraj.2.a:0 "We have truly fallen from grace"
 rahenraj.4.t:0 "A Potential Senapti"
 rahenraj.4.d:0 "The Harimraj is far from a static thing, and although stability would be preferable, internal conflicts are all too common. It seems, however, that through these conflicts, one of our Prabhis has grown in strength enough to rival the Senaptis, and it may be advantageous to recognise them as such."
 rahenraj.4.a:0 "Their strength shall be recognised"
 rahenraj.4.b:0 "We have enough Senapti already!"
 rahenraj.5.t:0 "A Harimari Ruler?"
 rahenraj.5.d:0 "As we are Senapti, one of the main expectations is that our nation is ruled by a Harimari. However, it seems that [Root.Monarch.GetName] does not fit the bill. If we were to replace them with a harimari, we would surely face instability, but if we were to keep them in power, we may lose the title of Senapti altogether!"
 rahenraj.5.a:0 "We must keep [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 rahenraj.5.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] must go!"
 rahenraj.6.t:0 "A Harimari Heir?"
 rahenraj.6.d:0 "As we are harimari, it is vital to ensure our nation remains ruled by harimari, in order to keep our delicate caste system in place. However, due to a variety of circumstances, it seems that our heir is not of the glorious harimari culture. We now face a choice; disinherit them, and put a proper harimari in their stead? Or keep them, and deal with the instability that follows?"
 rahenraj.6.a:0 "I don’t see what all this fuss is about"
 rahenraj.6.b:0 "Out with the old, in with the new!"
 rahenraj.7.a:0 "Sack all current commanders"
 rahenraj.7.t:0 "Reforming the Military"
 rahenraj.7.d:0 "The Raja has gathered the top military minds to discuss how to best reform the military. After a few hours of arguing, it occurs to [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the real problem here is the commanders themselves. Clearly, the best path forward is..."
 rahenraj.7.a:0 "Sack all current commanders"
 rahenraj.7.b:0 "Investigate each individual commander's loyalty"
 rahenraj.7.c:0 "Nevermind, this is too disruptive"
 rahenraj.8.t:0 "How Do We Want to Find New Officers?"
 rahenraj.8.d:0 "In order to remove the old, corrupt officiers, new talent will need to be found and vetted. How should the Raja proceed?"
 rahenraj.8.a:0 "Look for new commanders from the great families"
 rahenraj.8.b:0 "Host a public contest in exactly a year and recruit the best"
 rahenraj.9.t:0 "How Do We Want to Ensure the Loyalty of These New Officers?"
 rahenraj.9.d:0 "It's very easy for people to say they are loyal, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] would be foolish to immediately believe them. The Raja needs to figure out some way to determine whether these officers are truely loyal."
 rahenraj.9.a:0 "Soldiers are loyal to coin"
 rahenraj.9.b:0 "Hand pick them to ensure they are personally loyal to the Raja"
 rahenraj.10.t:0 "Noble Families Propose Candidates"
 rahenraj.10.d:0 "The noble families are quick to propose their favourite candidates, perhaps hoping to place a loyalist in charge. It is now up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide which candidate will serve the Raj best."
 rahenraj.10.a:0 "The great warrior"
 rahenraj.10.b:0 "The leader of troops"
 rahenraj.10.c:0 "The student of war"
 rahenraj.10.dd:0 "None are fitting, we will rely on the common soldier"
 rahenraj.11.t:0 "A Winner of the Great Contest"
 rahenraj.11.d:0 "The great contest displayed some truely impressive talent. While most entrants were fun to watch, only one can win. After a long day, one man stood victorius among the rest and we must now decide what to do with him."
 rahenraj.11.a:0 "We must have this man lead our armies!"
 rahenraj.11.b:0 "This man will lead the imperial bodyguard!"
 rahenraj.11.c:0 "His skill might be great, but his lack of noble blood is discouraging"
 rahenraj.12.t:0 "New General Organises the Military"
 rahenraj.12.d:0 "Our newly-appointed general has re-organized the military in record time and now can finally begin to see improvements."
 rahenraj.12.a:0 "Finally, structure!"
 rahenraj.13.t:0 "How Do We Want to Test Our Commanders' Loyalty?"
 rahenraj.13.d:0 "It's very easy for people to say they are loyal, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] would be foolish to immediately believe them. The Raja needs to figure out some way to determine whether these officers are truely loyal."
 rahenraj.13.a:0 "Gather intelligence on each commander"
 rahenraj.13.b:0 "Devise a test"
 rahenraj.14.t:0 "The Most Loyal Have Been Filtered Out and the Disloyal Have Been Put on a List"
 rahenraj.14.d:0 "Today, the Raja received a list which lists all commanders from most loyal to least loyal. Now, [Root.Monarch.GetName] must choose whether to use the carrot or the stick; whether to reward good behaviour or punish bad behaviour."
 rahenraj.14.a:0 "Reward the most loyal ones to promote good behaviour"
 rahenraj.14.b:0 "Sack the most disloyal and blackmail the other dissenters to have them fall in line"
 rahenraj.15.t:0 "The Test Preparations have been finished"
 rahenraj.15.d:0 "The ministers who were instructed to create a test of loyalty have returned to [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a finalized test."
 rahenraj.15.a:0 "Commence the tests"
 rahenraj.16.t:0 "The Test Has Been Concluded"
 rahenraj.16.d:0 "All the commanders and officers have taken the loyalty test. Some passed, some did not."
 rahenraj.16.a:0 "Make rank adjustments as appropriate"
 rahenraj.17.t:0 "Officers Have Fallen in Line"
 rahenraj.17.d:0 "After a rigorous program of reforms we have now managed to ensure the loyalty of our officer corps."
 rahenraj.17.a:0 "They better stay that way"
 rahenraj.20.t:0 "Reforming the Ministries"
 rahenraj.20.d:0 "The Ministries have long been ineffective and full of corrupt officials. The Raja is now in a position to begin reforming the ministries to stem the tide of corruption that infects every level of society."

 rahenraj.20.b:0 "Dismiss the ministries"
 rahenraj.21.t:0 "The Approach of the Board"
 rahenraj.21.d:0 "The Board of Inquiry has met for the first time and now faces a very large problem: what is the best way to reform the ministries? After lots of suggestions and debate, the Board of Inquiry finally presented their solution to the problem:"
 rahenraj.21.a:0 "Supervision of the ministries"
 rahenraj.21.b:0 "The purging of misbehaving ministers"
 rahenraj.22.t:0 "The First Steps"
 rahenraj.22.d:0 "At first, all large changes are resisted. It is more convienient to maintain the status quo than to adapt to a new and more accountable system. It may take some time yet, but the plan is in motion and has not been met with any active resistance so far."
 rahenraj.22.a:0 "It'll be a while"
 rahenraj.23.t:0 "We're Seeing Improvement"
 rahenraj.23.d:0 "The reforms are beginning to produce clear results and the ministries have begun to operate more efficiently and produce better results."
 rahenraj.23.a:0 "Good, good"
 rahenraj.24.t:0 "A High Level Suspect"
 rahenraj.24.d:0 "Among the Ministers, there is one that appears to be attempting to undermine the reforms. However, their resistance has become too much and today they were removed from their position and replaced with a loyalist."
 rahenraj.24.a:0 "Glad that's rooted out"
 rahenraj.25.t:0 "Functioning Ministries"
 rahenraj.25.d:0 "The reforms are approaching their full implementation and the Ministries are almost functioning as intended."
 rahenraj.25.a:0 "We're almost there"
 rahenraj.26.t:0 "The Ministries Have Been Cleansed"
 rahenraj.26.d:0 "At long last, the Minisitries have been reformed and can now function as intended. The corrupt Ministers have been replaced with loyal new ones who are most likely better at their job anyway."
 rahenraj.26.a:0 "Splendid"
 rahenraj.27.t:0 "Restoring the Ministry of Agriculture"
 rahenraj.27.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] needs to decide what to do with the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry has been a topic of conversation among the populous due to its incredible mismanagement of the food stocks. Some of the Raja's advisors advocate for removal of the Ministry entirely, instead giving the power to the local lords. Others think that the Ministry just needs a bit of a shakeup. All eyes now rest on the Raja, awaiting Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] decision."
 rahenraj.27.a:0 "Agriculture should be handled by the state, restore the Ministry!"
 rahenraj.27.b:0 "The local lords can handle this, no Ministry needed"
 rahenraj.28.t:0 "Restoring the Ministry of Philosophy"
 rahenraj.28.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] needs to decide what to do with the Ministry of Philosophy. The opponents of the Ministry reportedly told the Raja that all the Ministry does is 'think really hard and achieve zero results,' something that the Ministry of Philosophy took great offense to. The Ministry insists it does important work that is vital to the Harimari."
 rahenraj.28.a:0 "Restore the Ministry"
 rahenraj.28.b:0 "Let those old men go think really hard elsewhere"
 rahenraj.29.t:0 "Restoring the Ministry of Commerce"
 rahenraj.29.d:0 "The debate on what to do with the Ministry of Commerce is well underway by the time [Root.Monarch.GetName] makes it to the meeting. 'The economy, fools!' some old man has just yelled. However, the Raja is not in the mood to listen to their advisors squabble today and has already made up their mind."
 rahenraj.29.a:0 "Establish the Ministry of Commerce"
 rahenraj.29.b:0 "The economy is best left to the local lords"
 rahenraj.30.t:0 "Restoring the Ministry of Infrastructure"
 rahenraj.30.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] needs to decide what to do with the Ministry of Infrastructure. The Ministry has been a topic of conversation among the populous due to its inability to keep all the infrastructure working properly. Some of the Raja's advisors advocate for removal of the Ministry entirely, instead giving the power to the local lords. Others think that the Ministry just needs a bit of a shakeup. All eyes now rest on the Raja, awaiting Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] decision."
 rahenraj.30.a:0 "Let's build them up"
 rahenraj.30.b:0 "Let's tear them down"
 rahenraj.31.t:0 "Restoring the Ministry of Justice"
 rahenraj.31.d:0 "The Raja needs to decide what to do with the Ministry of Justice. While a central justice system is a neccessity for any sort of unified state, the current Ministry of Justice is known for picking and choosing who they want to charge. Perhaps it would then make more sense to decentralize the power of the Ministry of Justice."
 rahenraj.31.a:0 "Reform the judiciary"
 rahenraj.31.b:0 "We don't need them"
 rahenraj.32.t:0 "Collapse of the Raj"
 rahenraj.32.d:0 "The Raja has gutted so many of the Ministries there hardly seems to be anything left for the central government to do. The local lords have too much power now and many of them have decided to stop following the Raja altogether!"
 rahenraj.32.a:0 "Oh boy"
 rahenraj.40.t:0 "Reform the Foreign Office"
 rahenraj.40.d:0 "In a country with lots of squabbling nobles and potential friends and threats outside the borders, it is imperative that the Foreign Office be able to both charm and scare. However, currently, all the Foreign Office seems to be able to produce is babbling diplomats who fail everything they try and do. This must change."

 rahenraj.40.b:0 "Temporarily disestablish the foreign office"

 rahenraj.43.d:0 "The new trainees are smarter than they were when they arrived and some have quickly mastered the trade to the point where they can begin to be assigned to actual jobs."
 rahenraj.43.a:0 "Let's start sending out our first fully trained diplomats"
 rahenraj.44.t:0 "Now to develop the rest of our corps"

 rahenraj.44.a:0 "We want the best"
 rahenraj.45.t:0 "Talking to the world properly again"
 rahenraj.45.d:0 "After lots of hard work, the Foreign Office is once again filled with diplomats capable of both charming our friends and scaring our enemies, as well as negotiating with unreasonable countries."
 rahenraj.45.a:0 "Now we can return to a normal state of foreign relations"
 rahenraj.46.t:0 "The Raja speaks to the court of [raja_visiting_court.GetName]"
 rahenraj.46.d:0 "The Raja has arrived in our court and has begun to speak to our delegation. What should our goal be?"
 rahenraj.46.a:0 "Let's forge some relations"
 rahenraj.46.b:0 "I'd fuck them"
 rahenraj.46.c:0 "Time to show those idiots how you negotiate"
 rahenraj.46.dd:0 "Let's just go meet them"
 rahenraj.47.t:0 "Great diplomatic success in [raja_visiting_court.GetName]"
 rahenraj.47.d:0 "As expected, our wonderful diplomats expertly navigated through the meeting today and forged a stronger bonds with [raja_visiting_court.GetName]."
 rahenraj.47.a:0 "See, that's how you do it."
 rahenraj.48.t:0 "Diplomatic visit to [raja_visiting_court.GetName]"
 rahenraj.48.d:0 "The diplomatic delegation sent to [raja_visiting_court.GetName] will not go down in history as a great team, but at least they're better than what we used to have."
 rahenraj.48.a:0 "That went well enough."
 rahenraj.49.t:0 "Diplomatic blunder in [raja_visiting_court.GetName]"
 rahenraj.49.d:0 "The diplomat assigned to [raja_visiting_court.GetName] was clearly not prepared for the task. Everything was going just fine until our diplomat said something so offensive they were promptly removed from the area. Someone fire that diplomat!"
 rahenraj.49.a:0 "Whoops."
 rahenraj.50.t:0 "Reform the Nobility"
 rahenraj.50.d:0 "For far too long, the nobles of the Raj have ignored the Raja and exercised their own power. This unwillingness to fully submit to the Raja ends today, whether the nobility likes it or not."
 rahenraj.50.a:0 "Demand oaths of fealty and appoint loyal heirs"
 rahenraj.51.t:0 "Hosting a National Banquet and Demand Oaths of Fealty"
 rahenraj.51.d:0 "All the nobles of the Raj have been invited to a National Banquet to celebrate the greatness of the Raj and also to pledge their allegiance. It is an invitation that is not allowed to be refused."

 rahenraj.52.t:0 "An Invitation from the Raja"
 rahenraj.52.d:0 "The Raja demands we visit court to pledge our allegiance and they also wish to appoint our heir."
 rahenraj.52.a:0 "We will bow down to the Raja's will"
 rahenraj.52.b:0 "Who does the Raja think they are? They can come take our oath by force if they wants it!"
 rahenraj.53.t:0 "Nobility Curbed"

 rahenraj.93.a:0 "They better"
 rahenraj.98.t:0 "The Court is completely out of our control"
 rahenraj.98.d:0 "After years and years of slow decay, the state of the Raj has reached a tipping point. None of the Ministries are doing their jobs, the Foreign Office is creating only enemies, the military is in terrible shape, and the nobles are not listening to the Raja. Even the most clueless citizen is able to see that the Raj is not what it used to be."
 rahenraj.98.a:0 "How dare they disobey me!"
 rahenraj.97.t:0 "The Court has finally been reformed"
 rahenraj.97.d:0 "After a monumental amount of effort, the court has finally been reformed. The nobles are listening, the Ministries are governing, the Foreign Office are conferencing, and the military are preparing."
