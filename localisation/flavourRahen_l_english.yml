 rahen_corrupt_court:0 "The Corruption of the Dhenjinsar Court"
 
 rahenraj.0.t:0 "The decadence of the Raj"
 rahenraj.0.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER: The court of the Raj has been growing more and more powerful and corrupt. At this point the Raja has little control over the country and his subjects have gone to war with one another."
 rahenraj.0.a:0 "We need reform"
 rahenraj.1.t:0 "The Raja Has Fallen!"
 rahenraj.1.da:0 "Dhenjinsar has fallen, and with it, the old Raja! Across Rahen, former enemies and allies alike acknowledge us as the new leader of the harimraj. As much as things change, however, things stay the same, Prabhis and Senaptis bicker and squabble, harimari and Humans still struggle to get along, and trade still flows upon the Kharunyana, but for once, it is us who sit upon the throne in Dhenjinsar."
 rahenraj.1.db:0 "Dhenjinsar has fallen, and with it the Harimraj! Across the lands of Rahen, former Prabhis and Senaptis now stand as independent states, without the old Raja to tie them down. However, as much as things change, things stay the same, and across Rahen, various Raheni and harimari states are at each other’s throats, once more vying for supremacy over their corner of Rahen. However, with Dhenjinsar in our hands, although we make ourselves a large target, they have no chance of defeating our mighty armies. One thing is for sure however; Rahen will never be the same again."
 rahenraj.1.aa:0 "We are the heirs to the Harimraj"
 rahenraj.1.ab:0 "An era comes to a close"
 rahenraj.2.t:0 "A Senapti Falls"
 rahenraj.2.d:0 "Though we have most loyally and faithfully served the Raj for many years, our nation simply isn’t what it once was. Over time, we have fulfilled less and less of a role in the Raj, and other Senapti have begun to take more and more of the stage. As such, the Raj has seen fit to demote our great nation.\n\nWe are no longer Senapti; now we are Prabhi."
 rahenraj.2.a:0 "We have truly fallen from grace"
 rahenraj.4.t:0 "A Potential Senapti"
 rahenraj.4.d:0 "The Harimraj is far from a static thing, and although stability would be preferable, internal conflicts are all too common. It seems, however, that through these conflicts, one of our Prabhis has grown in strength enough to rival the Senaptis, and it may be advantageous to recognise them as such."
 rahenraj.4.a:0 "Their strength shall be recognised"
 rahenraj.4.b:0 "We have enough Senapti already!"
 rahenraj.5.t:0 "A Harimari Ruler?"
 rahenraj.5.d:0 "As we are Senapti, one of the main expectations is that our nation is ruled by a Harimari. However, it seems that [ruler name] does not fit the bill. If we were to replace them with a harimari, we would surely face instability, but if we were to keep them in power, we may lose the title of Senapti altogether!"
 rahenraj.5.a:0 "We must keep [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 rahenraj.5.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] must go!"
 rahenraj.6.t:0 "A Harimari Heir?"
 rahenraj.6.d:0 "As we are harimari, it is vital to ensure our nation remains ruled by harimari, in order to keep our delicate caste system in place. However, due to a variety of circumstances, it seems that our heir is not of the glorious harimari culture. We now face a choice; disinherit them, and put a proper harimari in their stead? Or keep them, and deal with the instability that follows?"
 rahenraj.6.a:0 "I don’t see what all this fuss is about"
