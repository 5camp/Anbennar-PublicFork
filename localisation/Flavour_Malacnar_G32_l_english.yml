 G32_rally_greatest_title: "Rally Our Greatest"
 G32_rally_greatest_desc: "Everybody in Malacnar needs to contribute. The noblest warriors descended from Levodas's companions need to set an example for newer ones; priests need to infuse the spirits of the population with courage and determination, and secure the favour of the holy Ynn River; merchant guilds need to secure money, equipment and new warriors from abroad. Do not fail, for history is not kind to those who fail."
 G32_deep_breath_title: "A Deep Breath Before War"
 G32_deep_breath_desc: "We have come far; farther than the ancient Kingdom of Malacnar at its apex. Perhaps even farther than Galadorn thought we would when he took up the sword of Varmeljon in 1377. To celebrate this moment our Battleking is doing something unprecedented: he declared a decade of peace; meaning cessation of wars, meaning we won't attack any of our neighbours.\n\nIf anybody is unhappy with this - the Battleking declared - they are free to sort things out with him by visiting his residence at the gardens of Grebniesth, where he and his companions will be tending to the flowers for the duration of the edict."
 G32_rebirth_sword_title: "Rebirth by the Sword"
 G32_rebirth_sword_desc: "The "Grebniesther Period", as it came to be known, has allowed us to take a step back and reflect on many things.\n\nFor one, even the City of Warriors can find itself short on fighters; it is important we launch recruitment campaigns across our conquered territories and teach the townspeople and village-goers a fraction of our military tradition.\n\nSecondly, our Battleking's prolonged residence in Grebniesth has helped further weaken what was once considered a taboo: that is, raising and training Malacnari warriors outside of Malacnar; we'd make good to capitalize on this, and normalize this practice."
 G32_life_spear_title: "Life by the Spear"
 G32_life_spear_desc: "For years new people have been climbing the southern cliffs to establish themselves all around the outskirts of the Ynn. Where there were once empty prairies and plains as far as the eye could see, towns and settlements have appeared and are growing at worrying rates. New nations, created overnight, are able to field armies of equal number to Ynnic hosts.\n\nBefore these people reverse into our Ynnic heartlands and drown us out - not that it wouldn't be a glorious spectacle to watch - we'd be good to discover their secret and use it for our own good."
 G32_death_iron_title: "Death by Iron"
 G32_death_iron_desc: "Malacnar controls one of the largest iron deposits in the Ynn, famously capable of arming more soldiers than an Emperor could gather. But now that we've taken the secrets of the Cannorians, their efficient army housings and advanced conscription techniques are letting us gather armies of unparalleled size, and our weaponsmiths are hard-pressed to keep up the pace. A development effort has thus been called by the Battleking, who will procure the smiths with all they need in order “to drown the world in weapons”."
 G32_wealth_upper_ynn_title: "Wealth of the Upper Ynn"
 G32_wealth_upper_ynn_desc: "The cities of Vareynn and Svemel, the dams of Mocbarja and Bosancovac. By now their people have gotten used to our rule, and to sharing part of their wealth with our warriors. As a reward, we will amplify their market squares, so that the wealth that passes through them is even greater."
 G32_malacnari_identity_title: "Malacnari Identity"
 G32_malacnari_identity_desc: "Malacnar's culture is one of the most ancient in the world after Flood. When Lukaus and his horseriders swept up the northern Ynn River Valley, they renamed it Dolindha and subdued Malacnar for a time, but we rose up again. When Vareynn and the Empire ruled over us, we kept our spirit and our way of life, or else we wouldn't stand here now as the masters of the Ynn.\n\nHowever, Malacnari language was gradually abandoned during the Imperial period, with even past Battlekings preferring to use Dolindhan in day-to-day life. Now that we have revived the glory of Malacnar, we will revive the beauty of Malacnari language."
 G32_southern_control_title: "Southern Control"
 G32_southern_control_desc: "The southron lordlings of Sarda always controlled a great deal of wealth: not only from the money they are able to extort for the passage of barges, but also from trading with visitors from beneath the Cliffs. Let the Sarda know: the days of playing bridge trolls with the dams are over. Let the Cannorians know: they will be speaking with our officers now.\n\nOur generals know just the place for a southern headquarters: the city of Arverynn. The decaying, decadent capital of the Ynnic Empire was founded by a great Emperor-General, Calrodiy I, and its central structure, the Teal Keep, still bears the solemnity to inspire a true army. From it, our generals will put the Jewel of the Ynn into shape, and keep an ample garrison ready to strike at the rest of Sarda."

 G32_school_of_war_title: "The School of War"
 G32_school_of_war_desc: ""
 

 G32_march_west_title: "March on the West Dam"
 G32_march_west_desc: "The last lordling of House yen Ceped hides within his last possessions - the swampy towns and ruins of Mocvare, all that remains of the house that once ruled half Dolindha. We will see if a cornered enemy truly fights best."
 G32_battlekings_passage_title: "Battleking's Passage"
 G32_battlekings_passage_desc: "House yen Ceped is no more. Once ruling over Malacnar, Galadorn overthrew their yoke, bested their knights and conquered their castle. Now that we've captured Mocvare the job is truly finished: a yen Ceped won't be ruling anywhere anytime soon, let alone in Malacnar."
 G32_heathen_host_title: "The Great Heathen Host"
 G32_heathen_host_desc: "To our west are the Drozma Tur, Followers of the Dragon. The oldest outsider group to become a subject of the Ynnic Empire, their fighting spirit was never fully extinguished and in 1367 it came back with a thunderous roar: thousands of them invaded Dolindha. An invasion which Malacnar's warriors regrettably missed out on; no matter, our showdown now will be glorious!"
 
 G32_values_title: "The Values of a Soldier"
 G32_values_desc: "Thirdly, is it enough to be strong? Aren't there times when two fighters who are loyal and well coordinated with each other can beat a much stronger warrior? Aren't there times when individualism falters against a wall of shields?\n\nIt might be time to take a page off Vareynn's book, and teach our citizens a series of virtues to champion and uphold, rather than leaving everything to the whims of the individual fighter."
 G32_discipline_title: "Discipline"
 G32_discipline_desc: "It is not enough to charge. A well-timed charge, coordinated with that of your fellow warriors, is like a crashing wave sent from the Ynn to wipe away infidels. A lonely charge, no matter how powerful, is like a bucket of water thrown in disperation. Let us drill discipline - the first tenet - into the heads of our warriors."
 G32_obedience_title: "Obedience"
 G32_obedience_desc: "Malacnar is ruled by the strongest. There is no need to doubt this as any weak Battleking will soon find a death in battle. And so will any unsubordinate warrior, if they try to sabotage him or question his orders.\n\nPunishments will be set: warriors who insult, unprovokedly attack or otherwise disobey their betters will be stripped of their main weapon, assigned spears and javelins, then sent to the forefront of the battle line where they will have to contend with the enemy's mouths of fire. This practice, known as "javelining", will in time ensure that only the most tough - or most obedient - of our soldiers will come out on top."
 G32_courage_title: "Courage"
 G32_courage_desc: "How could we forget the core quality of a warrior? When your companions are trembling, when you are facing a new enemy, a new weapon or a monster you've never seen before, courage is the quality that keeps you on the field, and allows you to win and prosper rather than turn tail and be ignobly cut down. In the worst case, you will have bought your companions precious time to escape, and you'll have kept high the fame of Malacnar. The Battlekings have always been champions of this virtue, and never asked of their warriors to do something they wouldn't do."
 G32_glory_title: "Glory"
 G32_glory_desc: "Every battle fought, every virtue followed, every sacrifice made, it all concurs to the pursuit of a greater dream. For many ancient warriors and Battlekings, this dream was glory: there is nothing better than being glorious, to be surrounded with oathsworn companions, loving wives, and cheering admirers. To be crowned Battleking of Malacnar, to have conquered it all and rule uncontested. And today, every step, every revolt, every battle we've fought concurs to the realization of their dream.\n\nEven if we may fall one day, like every warrior does eventually, and every Empire too, let us celebrate and rest today.\n\nWe may truly weep."
 
 
 G32_our_side_title: "Our Side of the River"
 G32_our_side_desc: "The Malacynn tributary of the Ynn River, running from Drevonbost to Amaceped, is one of the most fertile territories the Ynn River has blessed the land with. With its inhabitants being the strongest warriors to live, it is only a matter of time before we have an army ready to conquer Dolindha."
 G32_drenvosred_forest_title: "Drenvosred Forest"
 G32_drenvosred_forest_desc: "Dark, mysterious and full of perils... Malacnar's warriors have perhaps much to owe to the Drevonsred forest, for it is against its monsters, wandering out in an attempt to destroy all civilization, that the first inhabitants of Malacnar whetted their spirits in battle. It is time to impose our will on nature."
 G32_crossing_west_title: "Crossing to the West Bank"
 G32_crossing_west_desc: "The west bank of the Ynn is an undeveloped land, where you can't march an army a mile away from the Ynn River without getting harrassed by Epednar riders. Nonetheless, it is a crucial travel point towards Sarda; the only one, in fact, ever since Tromseloc on the Ynn's east bank fell to the Wendigos."
 G32_rule_north_title: "Our Rule of the North"
 G32_rule_north_desc: "The battler has felled the knight. Or perhaps he has integrated him into something greater. Whether the truth, Malacnar's victory over our old rival - the Dolindhans - is absolute and uncontested. Let our rule be a merciful one: the common elf, if he understands his place and wishes to serve our warriors or join them, will not be harmed and shall be treated well - barring a few jokes.\n\nAs for the lordlings who feasted on the corpse of the Ynnic Empire, they shall taste our fury, as we'll be coming for them and their supporters."

 G32_integrate_mage_title: "Integrate the Mage Lord"
 G32_integrate_mage_desc: "A short walk east of Malacnar, is the farmers town of Stantirshalas. Its people are timid and tame, they gladly send us money and grain so we can keep fighting in their stead.\n\nRecently however, the son of a local noble has distinguised himself as an exceptional battlemage - we want him in our army; and if we tighten our authority over Stantirshalas enough, we won't even have to humble ourselves asking his father."
 G32_old_score_title: "Settling the Old Score"
 G32_old_score_desc: "Everybody knows about the Battle of Drevonbost, where King Komerjon of Vareynn surrounded Battleking Vatrevid with the use of Brelari auxiliaries, and slew the Malacnari to the last elf. Let us burn into Vareynn's memory a defeat just as humbling."
 G32_bulwark_cursed_title: "Bulwark to the Cursed"
 G32_bulwark_cursed_desc: "The Amethyst Knights are by all means the ideal warrior - daring, determined, disciplined. They have to be, in order to fend off the greatest menace the Ynn has ever seen.\n\nOur warriors need to approach these masters with the due reverence, there is much they can learn by clashing arms with them. Perhaps, we will even be able to impress a few of them enough to make them join our ranks."

 G32_with_two_companions_title: "With Two §OCompanions§!"
 G32_with_two_companions_desc: "Contrasting with the hawkish policies of his precedessors, Alvarad Zabrmon was not only a mighty Battleking, but a charismatic one as well. Believing that strength in battle derived from strength in alliances, he strived to restore Malacnar's reputation from being "the Boogeyman of Dolindha" to once again a respected member of the Ynnic community, preventing a coalition and seeking in turn to establish a long-term triangular alliance with two Ynnic polities."
 G32_three_champions_title: "Three Champions"
 G32_three_champions_desc: "“You fortunate, happy few, thanks. Thanks. Thank you so much for being here today to write this moment, history will remember you forever. For choosing to be a part of a greater dream, a dream that will one day encompass the entire Ynn. Other lords and priests of the Ynn will look up to you as the lucky ones who chose companionship with Malacnar and thus won over all else; when they do, rebuke them: you chose to be here by an act of your will, pure and absolute, just like they chose to be on the side that just routed and fled.”\n-Alvarad's speech to his companions who had relieved him at the Battle of Badorn's Mound, 1447"
 G32_honor_friends_title: "Honor Your Friends"
 G32_honor_friends_desc: "While Alvarad's "Three Companions" plan came to fruition, it fell out of grace with the following Battlekings, who reverted to a "Malacnar First" policy and neglected their allies until the alliance was all but dissolved. This mustn't be allowed to happen."
 G32_companions_river_title: "§OCompanions§! of the River"
 G32_companions_river_desc: "It has been a long, beautiful journey. Who could've thought that people of other towns could make for such valiant, loyal companions to the Malacnari? And as they fought by our side, they came to respect us, admire us, and some even became like us. It is time to take our companionship a step further, and award their lords, knights and levies with honourary Malacnari citizenship."
