 gods_of_the_taychend_reform_2_desc: "The hero-cults are widespread and prominent in every corner of Taychend.

 gods_of_the_taychend_reform_3_desc: "The city is the cornerstone of Taychendi governance. Virtually all nobility gather in urban centers, and from these cities, collaborate with the urban poor to resist our rule. The great Taychendi empires of the past met their end due to the treachery of the urban elites, we must make sure history will not repeat again.

 gods_of_the_taychend_reform_4_desc: "The Taychendi script is disorganized, with every city seemingly having their own variant.

 #Events
 taychendi.1.t: "Death Of An Ally"
 taychendi.1.d: "Alliances are fickle things in the war torn land of Taychend. Bound by blood and personal relationships rather than treaties, alliances among the Taychendi rulers often end when one of the partners meets their demise. Unfortunately, we just received news of the death of the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName]. Thus, our alliance with them has come to an end."
 taychendi.1.a: "A sad day."
 taychendi.1.b: "This may effect the war..."
 taychend_no_stab_loss: "No §YStability§! is lost despite the alliance breaking during a war."
 taychend_kid_ruler_future_general: "When our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] ascends to the throne, [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] will also lead our armies."
 
 taychendi.2.t: "A Death, A Storm Brewing"
 taychendi.2.d: "Terrible news! The sovereign is dead! This can only bring horrible consequences for our realm. Whoever takes the empty throne must now navigate the fickle and unstable politics involved in the succession of the new monarch. Our provincial governors and local nobility grow disobedient, acting increasingly autonomous from our rule due to the weakness of the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nEven worse, the subject lords have made their move, taking full advantage of the current instability of our realm. They have raised their armies, seeking to gain freedom for themselves. A great storm is coming, we must act quickly."
 taychendi.2.a: "Rebels!"
 tayched_break_alliances: "All of our §YAlliances§! have §Rended§! along with our ruler's reign."
 
 taychendi.3.t: "A Death, A New Lord"
 taychendi.3.d: "Terrible news! The sovereign is dead! This can only bring horrible consequences for our realm. Whoever takes the empty throne must now navigate the fickle and unstable politics involved in the succession of the new monarch. Our provincial governors and local nobility grow disobedient, acting increasingly autonomous from our rule due to the weakness of the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nFortunately, our subjects have yet to show any sign of disloyalty. Whether they are truly loyal, or they have been sufficiently cowed into obedience by our previous lords, our vassals haven’t made a single move since our previous monarch’s death."
 taychendi.3.a: "They have made a wise choice."
 
 taychendi.4.t: "Disorder And Disobedience"
 taychendi.4.d: "Our new sovereign is untested, and is unable to wield the same authority as their predecessor. Local nobility refuse to submit to our rule, and the population grows restless. Our administration has become overburdened, and is unable to properly extract revenue from our lands. We will have to solve this problem, one way or another."
 taychendi.4.a: "Create new subjects from our lands."
 taychend_capacity_release_tt: "No longer existing tags whose cores we own shall be released as vassals until our §YGoverning Capacity§! is under §Y101%§!."
 taychendi.4.b: "Give land to our existing subjects."
 taychend_capacity_feed_tt: "Our subjects shall recieve provinces of our adjacent to them until our §YGoverning Capacity§! is under §Y101%§!. This shall prioritize their cores, and never cede a province in our Capital state."
 taychendi.4.c: "I will handle this personally."
 taychendi.4.dd: "My line need not concern itself with this."
 taychend_do_it_yourself: "§YThis event shall not fire again.§!"
 
 taychendi.5.t: "Buying Boats"
 taychendi.5.d: "The lords of Taychend never bothered much with the sea. They could never afford to, for their rivals on land were always a much bigger threat. Even the lords of Oremvand and Nagyar Vyechei focused their attention on inland matters rather than the lands beyond. Thus, naval affairs were left entirely in the hands of the merchant guilds, who held an exclusive monopoly on shipbuilding techniques and naval expertise.\n\nOur lord has reached out to the merchant guilds, seeking to purchase ships for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fleet. The merchant guilds are happy to accept, on the promise of more favorable treatment by our kingdom."
 taychendi.5.a: "Nevermind"
 taychendi.5.b: "Buy One Light Ship"

 taychendi.5.g: "Buy Five Galleys"
 taychendi.5.h: "Hire 500 Sailors"
 
 taychendi.6.t: "Outraged Enemies Attack Us!"
 taychendi.6.d: "In Taychend, the death of a ruler is always seen as a good opportunity to exploit the weaknesses of an enemy. When those weaknesses are great, the resulting opportunity can be too - and such has occured here. A terrible crisis has befallen our nation, as the death of our previous ruler has given those who despise us the confidence they need to declare war! Woe befalls the land, as every elf knows that dark days are ahead. However, if we can overcome this, we can shatter that false confidence of the enemy, sundering memories of our aggressive expansion alongside it - and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will surely benefit from a glorious victory."
 taychendi.6.a: "A terrible crisis and a terrific opportunity..."
 taychend_coalition_declared_on_ruler_death_tt: "All countries with §G>100§! §YAggressive Expansion§! against us have declared a §GCoalition War§!!"
 
 religious_reforms.6.t: "Taychendi Reform"
 religious_reforms.6.d5: "We have achieved the unthinkable, the impossible. The great cycle of warlordism, which had for so long plagued Taychend since the ruin, has been ended by us. The establishment of a Taychendi empire, centralized, stable, and united. Through the many trials and tribulations we faced, we have managed to form a state that stood firm against all resistance the peoples of Taychend formed against it. Our empire is The Empire of Taychend, and, gods willing, the final empire of Taychend."
 religious_reforms.6.d4: "The peoples of the provinces are not taking the standardization of the Taychendi writing system lying down. Loyalist governors have now started advocating greater autonomy from our rule, and in every sense have turned their backs on our kingdom. It seems as though the homogenizing of the Taychendi script was the final straw for many against our policies of centralization. Our agents report the formation of militias and armies all across the countryside, many organized by our own governors, clearly being used as a sword at our throats. It seems this is the final test, if we can outlast this crisis, Taychend will be ours for the taking."
 religious_reforms.6.d3: "The decision to destroy the autonomy of the cities has caused widespread anger and outrage. Both the urban elites and the urban poor have banded together, our governors and loyal officials having been defenestrated! The city militias have closed the gates to our armies, and now proclaim full independence from our rule! This is a true test of our strength, we must not falter, lest we fall like the empires that came before us."
 religious_reforms.6.d2: "The cults are not pleased with our recent attempts to control them. Already their leaders have begun organizing their members, stocking piling weapons and supplies, and calling upon other cults in our land to do the same. We knew it was not going to be easy to bring the cults to heel, yet it seems we underestimated their true power. We must mobilize the army, as a new period of religious strife is upon us."
 religious_reforms.6.d1: "The replacement of the local lords with loyalists has not gone perfectly, but in the end they all submitted. Our loyalists now rule on the ground, and we can safely say we have control of our own territory now. Still, the reorganization and redistribution of land ownership in our kingdom has caused some instability, but we will recover."
 religious_reforms.6.a: "We will continue with the current course, no matter what resistance we face."

 #Kamrayakvals War Events

 oren_nayiru.100.t: "Spite and Silver"
 oren_nayiru.100.d: "Elrandar Silverspite sat along the banks of the river, turning a blackened collar of precursor steel over and over in his hand, as the setting sun bathed the water in an orange glow. Behind him, the rest of the mercenary company he led were setting up their camp, pitching tents and setting a perimeter. He liked to set up camp early, fortify their position in case of ambush. Too many warlords were lax with camp security – he’d exploited that fact more times than he could count. Nothing more than undisciplined, upjumped bandits, as foolish as they were cruel. He refused to stoop to their level.\nAdventure. Money. Fortune. Was that all there was to his life? In his latest job, his forces had smashed some upstart warlord or other, all to help another upstart warlord expand his own power. Neither deserved his help. The job before that, he’d fought an Oren Nayiru revolt. He’d always had a soft spot for them, and so he’d let most of them escape, and even taken one of their “Kavalali” in.\n“I think there is more.” Silverspite said, plainly. He looked up, towards the setting sun. His father had been born amongst those flames, in a land far away, hundreds of years ago. An “Exemplar”. When he was young, his mother had told him stories of his father, of how he was off purging the world of the darkness, of evil, of how he’d come back eventually and save them from the dark. He never came back. And when the darkness set his village ablaze and murdered his mother, the Sun Elves were nowhere to be found. He had learnt that day what the Exemplars truly were. They were weak.\nHe scorned his father then – his purpose, his ideals, even his last name. He earned a new name, born from his hatred. A hatred of weakness, though truthfully he knew himself to suffer from the same disease. He knew the Exemplars to be a dead end. Doomed in their dissolution. What is purpose, after all, if you do not have the power to fulfil it? He did not claim purpose any more. Maybe that was a mistake.\nSilverspite looked once more to the black-iron collar in his lap. “I think there is more,” he repeated, as he opened the clasp at it’s back and slipped it on his neck. It closed with a satisfying click. “I think I do have a purpose.” Immediately, he felt the power surge through him, the magic and spite and rage. “And I think I have found my power.”"

 oren_nayiru.102.t: "Eclipse"
 oren_nayiru.102.d: "Silverspite knelt before the crowd, a hundred thousand strong, and before the High Kavalali. It had taken two years of political wrangling, spearheaded by the Uesrennu cell, to get to this point. The faith was divided no longer – a representative of each of the most powerful cells held a banded crown together in their hands. They spoke in turn. “In the name of Nayiru”, said Uesrennu’s High Kavalal. “We charge you,” said Katelperai’s. “To lead our armies,” said Clematar. “And guide our faith,” Nagar Vyechei. “From this day,” Gophira. “To your final day,” Sthanan. “A sword of dawn,” Rakkabuttai, “A voice of reason,” Royakottar. The Three of Nanru Nakar took one word each, Kilaeik, Kriadvai, then Mlerek. “As.” “Our.” “Kamrayakval.”\nThe High Kavalali, as one, lowered the crown onto Silverspite’s head, then stepped back. The elf rose, though all anyone could see was a dragon in armour-form. The crowd was silent – his crowning, after all, was not the main event. The Kamrayakval looked around, searching the crowd. Eventually, he found his old companions, from his company. He gave them a curt nod, of appreciation and gratitude he’d never been able to put into words, then began to speak.\n“People have been trod on, and subjugated, and enslaved, for a very, very long time The world cast into darkness, by the Kheionai, by the warlords, by the Slaver-Nobles, by the dragons I’m wearing on my back right now!” Anger crept into his voice – he caught it, then harnessed it. He’d never spoken like this before, except in battle. Silverspite unsheathed a sword, pointing it at those assembled. “But here that ends! That ends today, and it ends with you, and it ends with me! It ends when we take spear and sword and musket and we sweep over the world LIKE SUN CONQUERS NIGHT!” He spun as he cried out, watched as the eyes of his faithful lit up as his did, with dragonflame and spite and bloody desire. “Everyone here! Everyone who takes up the black banner of the Dawn! We are ALL born with purpose. To destroy chaos, to destroy destruction! To kill their servants and cast them back into the dark! To furrow our fields with the blood of the warlords and the tyrants, the slavers and invaders and colonisers! We bore that purpose, but for centuries, millenia, hundreds of thousands of years and more we have been weak! Weak! Well no longer – because now, we are powerful! Because now something has changed! Because I am here and I–! AM–! POWER! So follow me, brothers, sisters! Give your lives and your blood for DAWN! And to any who oppose us, who stand in our way, to the warlords and invaders and their lackeys, I DECLARE WAR! WAR FOR THE COMING OF THE DAY! WAR FOR THE DEATH OF DARKNESS!”\nSilverspite thrust his blade to the sky. For a short moment, the crowd was silent still. Then the cry of a man cut through it. “War!” He called. A second stillness, then “WAR!” came the cry of the crowd. “WAR!” They thrust their fists and sabres and muskets and spears into the air, and “WAR!” echoed the declaration, for the gods, for Nayiru themselves to hear. “WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR!”"
