 lake.30.t:0 "Role of the State"
 lake.30.d:0 "Perhaps the most fundamental question of statecraft is determining the proper role of government. The most ancient view is that governments exist to ensure the security of their citizens and borders from both internal and external threats. On the other hand, the rising classes of merchants and skilled artisans often see the government as primarily existing to secure the flow of commerce and ensure the efficient flow of trade. Newer, more radical groups believe that the government should take a more active role in managing industry and employing citizens in the production of goods. Which view do we favor?"
 lake.30.a:0 "The state has a monopoly on violence."

 lake.30.c:0 "The state exists to secure commerce."
 
 lake.31.t:0 "The Citizen"
 lake.31.d:0 "As we develop our government, we must ask ourselves who our citizens should aspire to be. Some advisors have proposed the propagation of a nationwide military spirit, in which each person sees themselves as part of the Federation's larger efforts to protect its borders and expand beyond them. Others suggest that we ought to be a nation of artisans and crafters, people who aspire toward excellency in their work. The wealthiest of our counselors propose that our citizens see themselves as merchants, trying to make good deals and earn glory through profit. We must choose one of these paths."
 lake.31.a:0 "All our citizens have a role in national security."
 lake.31.b:0 "The work of our citizens shall be the envy of the world!"
 lake.31.c:0 "A good citizen understands the value of wealth."
 
 lake.32.t:0 "Crime and Punishment"
 lake.32.d:0 "Sadly, some elements of our society will always commit crimes. Though most crimes are small and can be handled by a small fine or temporary incarceration. The gravest of crimes can only be dealt with by death or a lifetime in a dungeon. What should we do with those in the middle, the ones who commit serious offenses but might yet redeem themselves?"

 lake.36.t:0 "The Settling of Disputes"
 lake.36.d:0 "People will always try to defend their honor, so a stable government provides its citizens with ways to settle their disputes within the boundaries of the law. This promotes national cohesion, reduces violence, and avoids vigilante justice. How will our new state tackle this challenge?"
 lake.36.a:0 "A formal system of duels is all that is needed."
 lake.36.b:0 "Expand the system of guild arbitration."
 lake.36.c:0 "Courts may award monetary damages."
 
 lake.37.t:0 "Fate of the Conquered"
 lake.37.d:0 "Handling the fate of a newly conquered people is a difficult problem for governments. If you leave the population too well-off, they may have the resources to rebel. On the other hand, if you are too demanding of them, they may feel they must rebel anyway. What shall be our policy?"
 lake.37.a:0 "Place their communities under military supervision."
