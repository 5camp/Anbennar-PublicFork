 lake.1.t:0 "The Federation Linguistic Academy"
 lake.1.d:0 "Though the peoples of the Lake Federation share a common culture, and nominally a common language as well, different regions have developed their own dialects. This has unfortunately impeded the free flow of people, information, and goods. To reduce these barriers, the Federation Linguistic Academy was founded to create a standardized, 'proper' form of the language. Certain elements of the court believe speaking the same language as our neighbors will ease our future expansion into their lands, and so they encourage us to join it. Others, however, believe in maintaining our distinctive regional character."
 lake.1.a:0 "We shall join the academy!"
 lake.1.b:0 "Absolutely not!"
 
 lake.2.t:0 "The Islanders Declaration"
 lake.2.d:0 "The idea of recognizing a single national identity for all citizens of the Federation has been a long-term goal of the unification movement for some time now. With the creation of the Islanders Declaration, a document that recognizes the people of the Island as a single, united nation divided only by politics rather than by culture, the opportunity to lend institutional legitimacy to this notion has never been better. We must decide whether we will back the pro-unification tendencies in this matter or remember our unique ancestral roots from before we came to inhabit the Island."
 lake.2.a:0 "Sign it!"
 lake.2.b:0 "We must not abandon our roots."
 
 lake.3.t:0 "Universal Clothing Distribution"
 lake.3.d:0 "The environment of the Lakes is not kind to those who are ill-prepared to face the elements. Humidity, rain, and insects all detract from the productivity of poorly-clothed laborers. While providing clothing may incur a small expense on the part of the Federation, the gains in both public morale and production should far outweigh it."
 lake.3.a:0 "So long as they know who is giving it to them..."
 
 lake.4.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agricultural Reforms"
 lake.4.d:0 "With the application of modern agricultural techniques, we can harness our abundant supply of fresh water to feed our people without depleting the soil."
 lake.4.a:0 "Great!"
 
 lake.5.t:0 "Preservation Act"
 lake.5.d:0 "The long-term storage of food is in the national interest, lest the State be vulnerable to the public's ire during seasons of poor harvest. By maintaining the necessary stores of salt we can begin a program of food preservation. During the next time of hardship, our foresight will doubtlessly pay off in spades."
 lake.5.a:0 "I do so love salted meats..."
 
 lake.6.t:0 "Judiciary System"
 lake.6.d:0 "Convoluted, overlapping and redundant systems of law have led to arbitrary decisions, inequality, and a general sense of unfairness. A clearly written, universal law code will provide much-needed transparency. Of course, these convoluted systems have always given a certain edge to those in power, who are the only ones capable of navigating them. Successfully completing this reform will thus require an investment of political capital."
 lake.6.a:0 "A modern state requires modern laws"
 
 lake.7.t:0 "Artisans of the Federation"
 lake.7.d:0 "The beating heart of any advanced economy is the artisan class: those who give raw materials value by manufacturing beautiful and useful items out of them. The expanding middle class of our society has come to demand an ever-growing number of manufactured goods. With careful investment we can help our artisans meet this new demand, making them wealthier and more productive."
 lake.7.a:0 "It will make us wealthier, too."
 
 lake.8.t:0 "Federal Fishing Regulations"
 lake.8.d:0 "Since time immemorial the people of the Lakes have lived in large part off the bounty of the sea. Unfortunately, the uneven distribution of fishermen has led to certain areas being considerably less productive. New Federation regulations hope to address this by establishing specific fishing zones for each community, which should help keep the numbers of fish in any one area more consistent and improve their numbers overall. Controlling access to these zones is also a great opportunity to raise additional revenues."
 lake.8.a:0 "Fish are okay, but I love additional revenues."
 
 lake.9.t:0 "Every Man a Landlord"
 lake.9.d:0 "In the past, the average citizen has had to rent their homes and lands from large, wealthy landowners. This is an unfortunate state of affairs, since it not only keeps some of our citizens in poverty, but also obligates them to private citizens. Such conflicting loyalties are archaic, as every citizen's first duty must be to the State."
 lake.9.a:0 "Oh, their adorable little cottages!"
 
 lake.10.t:0 "The Administrative Supply"
 lake.10.d:0 "Great shortages of a critical good have hampered the easy and efficient administration of our territories. Fortunately, new investments should help ease that difficulty."
 lake.10.a:0 "Wait, you mean paper?"
 
 lake.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] Proposes Unification"
 lake.11.d:0 "[From.GetName] has laid out in painstaking detail the great inefficiencies of our current system. Their delegation makes a persuasive case that the Federation's future hinges on whether we can unify as one people under one administration. They point to the need for a united front against external threats, and, of course, the potential wealth that unification could bring."
 lake.11.a:0 "A necessity."
 
 lake.12.t:0 "Free Trade Agreement"
 lake.12.d:0 "A delegation from [From.GetName] has proposed a free trade agreement that would greatly relax the barriers impeding the free flow of goods across political boundaries. Theoretically, everyone should benefit. Of course, certain politically influential individuals may find the idea of new competition unappealing, and they could surely prove to be valuable allies if only we were to continue protecting them."
 lake.12.a:0 "Free trade will lead to cheaper goods and easier sales!"
 lake.12.b:0 "...but won't anyone think of the domestic industry?"
 
 lake.13.t:0 "The Twin Roles"
 lake.13.d:0 "There are two types of people: those who wield weapons and those who pay for them. Both contributions are equally valid, and the time has come to choose which service we will lend to the Federation as a whole."
 lake.13.a:0 "We shall fight!"
 lake.13.b:0 "We prefer the home front."
 lake.13.c:0 "Sounds like something for other people to do."
 
 lake.14.t:0 "The Gleaming Banners"
 lake.14.d:0 "The era of petty militias and loosely disciplined militaries is coming to an end. We now command a standing army of brave and faithful soldiers, but their patchwork armor and worn weapons are a sorry sight. Surely it is time for us to be faithful to them in turn and make sure they look the part?"
 lake.14.a:0 "Good equipment is both useful and fashionable."
 
 lake.15.t:0 "The [From.GetName] Military Reforms"
 lake.15.d:0 "[From.GetName], in the interest of the Federation as a whole, has developed a plan for standardizing our various fighting forces so that they might have an easier time coordinating on the battlefield. Along with these standardizations comes recommendations for new military practices which should help our military stand up against our many threats, both foreign and domestic."
 lake.15.a:0 "True power comes from soldier's steel"
 
 lake.16.t:0 "Mainland Colonization"
 lake.16.d:0 "Our ancestors once abandoned the mainland and fled to the islands on which we now make our homes. Recent developments have opened an opportunity for our people as a whole to begin the reclaimation of their ancestral homes, but many argue that doing so is entirely unnecessary."
 lake.16.a:0 "It is our birthright!"
 lake.16.b:0 "Personally, I just adore the islands."
 
 lake.17.t:0 "Our Navy"
 lake.17.d:0 "As a maritime nation, our shipyards are constantly at work repairing and building new vessels, whether those be private fishing vessels or grand warships. As a result, the time and labor of experienced shipbuilders is a precious commodity, and we must choose whether to dedicate it mostly to the construction of our great merchant fleets or to the construction of military vessels."
 lake.17.a:0 "Military ships command the waves!"
 lake.17.b:0 "Commercial vessels bring prosperity."
 
 lake.18.t:0 "The Piracy Question"
 lake.18.d:0 "Pirates have been preying on our vulnerable vessels for some time now, and the situation has become untenable. Our advisors have presented us with two solutions: either we can chase them down and give them the noose, or we can pay them to go bother someone else instead."
 lake.18.a:0 "Pirates? These fine gentlemen are privateers!"
 lake.18.b:0 "These criminals will receive nothing but death!"
 
 lake.19.t:0 "The Anti-Piracy Act"
 lake.19.d:0 "Having long been a scourge to the innocent merchant vessels of the Federation, recent legal developments have made sponsoring piracy a high crime. Pirate hunters have been commissioned to destroy the last of their criminal hideouts, and justice will finally be served."
 lake.19.a:0 "Our choices will always have consequences..."
 
 lake.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] ask for War Rights"
 lake.20.d:0 "A delegation from [From.GetName] came to us asking for War Rights. These would allow them to legally wage a military campaign against another member of the Federation."
 lake.20.a:0 "A shake-up is always good"
 lake.20.b:0 "And spill innocent blood? Of course not!"

 lake.21.a:0 "Great!"
 
 lake.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] Response"
 lake.22.d:0 "Our diplomats were greatly disrespected by their reception in [From.GetName], which has denied us the legal recognition we needed to wage war. A grave insult!"
 lake.22.a:0 "A slight we will not easily forget"
 
 lake.23.t:0 "Loss of War Rights"
 lake.23.d:0 "Having now declared war on another member of the Federation, the War Rights we had previously received are now nullified."
 lake.23.a:0 "Understood."
 
 lake.27.t:0 "Unification of the Federation"
 lake.27.d:0 "Having declared their intention to unify the Federation, [From.GetName] has built their new State. They wish for us to join it, and in so doing participate in the betterment of all our people. Of course, giving up our independence is not going to go over well with some..."
 lake.27.a:0 "We move forward as one!"
 lake.27.b:0 "We will not recognize their so-called 'unification'"
 
 lake.28.t:0 "Crisis in the Federation"
 lake.28.d:0 "The squabbling of petty power brokers in the Federation, without strong central leadership, has plunged it into a terrible political crisis. The institutions of the Federation have locked up as internecine conflict drives each group to seek to deny advantages to the others."
 lake.28.a:0 "We need to get out of here!"
 
 lake.29.t:0 "End of the Crisis"
 lake.29.d:0 "The emergence of a strong new order within the Federation has allowed business to return to normal, and now that the institutional gridlock has been resolved the crisis should soon abate."
 lake.29.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 lake.39.t:0 "End of the Federation"

 lake.40.a:0 "Our time to shine!"
 
 lake.41.t:0 "The Twin Cities of Zabyos and Tlar"
 lake.41.d:0 "As the city grows, the difference between the high and lower classes in Zabyos'tlar has become all too visible. The city has grown up and over the canal, bathing the lower districts in darkness while the Zabyos'tlaric elite thrive high above. With this divide the city has become known as two, the grand and opulent Sky Walk of Zabyos above and the filthy, darkened Undercity of Tlar below."

He has declared himself the prophet of 'Kaylin', the true and only Lake Goddess, the embodiment of everything and everyone. An ever-growing number of the common folk are listening to this so-called 'prophet', as the recent religious war weakened their faith in the Triunic Goddesses.

Believers claim that Enuuk, Kodave, and Yukel are but mere aspects of her singular divinity. Kaylin presents herself as the embodiment of all things and her followers preach unity and oneness in the Federation just as Kaylin herself represents oneness among the Divine. Her followers are not pacifists, however; they proclaim that it is the Federation's moral obligation to bring ruthless retribution to her enemies beyond its borders. With the strife and division of the religious war fresh in their minds, many have come to adhere to this idea, hoping that Kaylin represents an opportunity for peace and co-existence within the Federation.

 I89_the_burgeoning_storm_desc:0 "The storm has begun. Across the plains, more and more centaurs rally to our Caehn’s banner. Already, our armies are fighting with more zeal and determination than in all of our history. We are no longer a light breeze, now, we are a great wind!"
 I89_the_growing_storm_title:0 "The Growing Storm"

 I89_the_expanding_storm_title:0 "The Expanding Storm"
 I89_the_expanding_storm_desc:0 "Further and further, our armies march. All who would, or could, stand before us, fall in their hundreds, and then in their thousands. Our storm is far from over, no longer are we but rain, now, our rains are torrential!"
 I89_the_spreading_storm_title:0 "The Spreading Storm"
 I89_the_spreading_storm_desc:0 "Larger and larger, our empire grows. No longer constrained to the plains, our Caehnate’s rule can be felt in lands which were mere myth decades ago. Our conquests seem only to continue, as our storm is no longer just rain and wind, but joined by thunder and lightning. Our torrential rains are now a thunderstorm!"
 I89_the_thriving_storm_title:0 "The Thriving Storm"
 I89_the_thriving_storm_desc:0 "Greater and greater, our Caehnate becomes. Our storm not only survives, battering down its foes, but brings new life in its wake, new fields for our people to call home. We do not just conquer, we do not just make it one day after the other. Now, we thrive. Our storm has grown further, from a miniscule thunderstorm, to a towering cyclone!"
 I89_the_rampaging_storm_title:0 "The Rampaging Storm"
 I89_the_rampaging_storm_desc:0 "Stronger and stronger, our soldiers become, as entire empires bow down to the might of the Caehnate. We have truly become one of the greatest empires in the history of Halann, and yet, still there are more lands to conquer. No longer are we merely a cyclone, but a rampaging typhoon!"
 I89_the_eternal_storm_title:0 "The Eternal Storm"
 I89_the_eternal_storm_desc:0 "None stand before us. All who would have, have been slaughtered. There truly are no equals left to face the storm. Every army the world could throw at us has been sent, and it has been crushed in a relentless stampede. Our storm is no wind, no torrential rain, no thunder, no lightning, no cyclone, no typhoon. It is far, far more than that. It is eternal."
 I89_stallions_of_war_title:0 "Stallions of War"
 I89_stallions_of_war_desc:0 "In countless battles, across countless battles, time and time again our armies have emerged triumphant. Yet, it is not by the might of the common centaur alone that victory is attained. Rather, for our Caehnate to succeed, great commanders must be able to lead our armies with confidence and skill. Some, from amongst our ranks, have shown remarkable skill and ability, both as soldiers and commanders. We shall bring them into our Caehn’s inner circle, forming a trusted council of advisors; the Stallions of War."
 
 I89_just_a_lake_stories_title:0 "Just a Lake Story"
 I89_just_a_lake_stories_desc:0 "When we first came to these lands, exiled by the humans of the west, we found yet more humans to the east. These humans, however stood little chance before our clans on the wide, open plains. Fearful, they retreated to the islands of the north, leaving the plains to our ancestors. Yet now, a thousand years later, they think themselves safe. They think that their lakes and walls, their boats and soldiers, their so-called “federation” will protect them from the storm that is to come. We will happily show them the error of their ways."
 I89_wealth_requisition_title:0 "Wealth Requisition"
 I89_wealth_requisition_desc:0 "We must admit, the cities these humans have built certainly are grand, with their great buildings, and hoards of treasure. In fact, many of our warriors were amazed at the sheer scale of these monuments of humanity, especially in comparison to the vast emptiness of our current home. As such, efforts must be made to destroy these monuments immediately, and bring the treasures hidden within back to our Caehnate’s heartlands."
 I89_southern_submission_title:0 "The Southern Submission"
 I89_southern_submission_desc:0 "The southern half of the lands of the Triunic lakes are now firmly under our Caehn’s control. Whether subjugated, conquered, or slaughtered, all of the humans still alive in our lands have sworn fealty to us, leaving our armies free to turn northwards, and annihilate this federation once and for all."
 I89_disband_the_federation_title:0 "§ODisband the Federation§!"
 I89_disband_the_federation_desc:0 "It is done. These islanders, who have so long fought against our armies, have been brought to submission. All that remains is to destroy whatever dreams of their unity they once had. The flimsy paper which binds their federation together will be razed, just like their farms, their cities, and their people. The lake sought to fight against the storm, and instead, it was swept away."
 I89_bulwar_proper_title:0 "Bulwar Proper"
 I89_bulwar_proper_desc:0 "This land we march through, on our journey to our ancient home, is far richer and more prosperous than we expected. We must relieve them of this burden. Our armies shall march west as well as north, and bring what they call Bulwar under the centaur yoke. Their Sura’el shall not save them; the storm will blot out the sun."
 I89_under_the_sun_title:0 "§OUnder the Sun§!"
 I89_under_the_sun_desc:0 "These lands, from the hills in the north, to the deserts of the south, to the riverlands in between, all are ours. Their temples to false gods, their monuments to forgotten priests, their cities and metropolises, all have been crushed under our hooves. Yet, this is far from the end of our conquests. Beneath the heat of endless sun, the storm obtains new vigor."
 I89_divine_wind_title:0 "Divine Wind"
 I89_divine_wind_desc:0 "Our armies stand victorious in countless conflicts, unmarred by defeat even after all these years. Our Caehnate eclipses all others, leaving none to stand against us. Yet, we still abide by petty diplomacy, things like alliances, friendship, truces. But why should we? Why should scraps of paper and handshakes constrain our endless conquest? Well constrained our conquests shall be no more! After all, who needs diplomacy when you have an army like the Caehn’s?"
 
 I89_eye_of_the_storm_title:0 "Eye of the Storm"
 I89_eye_of_the_storm_desc:0 "From humble origins, our horde has grown. Once, we were but one of many clans roaming these lands, as we have done so for thousands of moons. Now, however, our hooves and hearts beat as one. We stand united under our great Caehn, as we stand united against all who would oppose us. The time is now, for the world to tremble, to fear us! A storm is coming, and soon, it shall engulf the world."
 I89_subjugate_the_ogre_title:0 "§OSubjugate the Ogres§!"
 I89_subjugate_the_ogre_desc:0 "To our west, clinging to their mountains as a calf clings to its mother, lie the lands of the ogres. These great, cannibalistic warriors have forever clashed with the clans who approach their lands, seeing themselves as somehow equal to us. We shall free them of their delusions, pounding their lands to dust in the process. Their villages will burn. Their children will be slaughtered. The Caehn will reign supreme. Our storm will grow."
 I89_a_lonely_oasis_title:0 "A Lonely Oasis"
 I89_a_lonely_oasis_desc:0 "To our south, where the plains give way to desert, lies a single oasis. The Serpent’s Gift. This land, though dry and barren beyond the oasis, is home to one crucial thing; a pass westwards. The great Serpentspine Mountains, which have so long separated us from our ancient homeland, will stop us no more. The storm moves south, so that it may move westward. "
 I89_way_back_home_title:0 "Way Back Home"
 I89_way_back_home_desc:0 "Go toward the Deepwoods"
 I89_ancestor_home_title:0 "§OAncestor's Home§!"
 I89_ancestor_home_desc:0 "This is it. We’re home. The fey, who once cast us out, now fear and respect us. Those orcs and elves, mere squatters, have been driven out or subjugated. As our armies march through the glades, memories of a time long past seem to wash through them. A time of peace, of coexistence. Yet, the world we have inherited is not one of peace, nor one of friendship. It is one of war, of death, of the Caehnate. The storm engulfs our homeland, and rages ever onwards."
 
 I89_consolidate_our_holdings_title:0 "§OConsolidate our Holdings§!"
 I89_consolidate_our_holdings_desc:0 "Though our Caehn has been named leader of all centaurs, there are still some of our people who resist his destiny. We must consolidate the plains, bringing what few independent centaur clans under our ever-expanding banner. Negeal is coming, whether they like it or not. For their destiny is forever intertwined with ours, and destiny, as they say, is inevitable."
 I89_back_on_our_track_title:0 "Back on Track"
 I89_back_on_our_track_desc:0 "A thousand years ago, our people arrived in Yyl Moista, the Northern Forest, little more than scattered refugees. Now, we return to this land, not as those fleeing conquest, but as conquerors. Our paths shall be retread, and our armies shall head north, to show all who once wronged us the fury of the storm."
 I89_the_northern_pass_title:0 "The Northern Pass"
 I89_the_northern_pass_desc:0 "The endless snows, the dense trees, the vile swamps. This land is far from desirable, and yet, it is where the hated Castan Beastbane once forced our ancestors to flee. Now, however, the pass shall serve a new purpose. A great highway, for our forces to march northwards, and to come down upon Castanor with a fury like no other. Remain ignorant, oh humans, in your precious towns and cities. The storm is coming, to leave only vengeance and destruction in its wake."
 I89_deja_vu_title:0 "Déjà Vu"
 I89_deja_vu_desc:0 "The time has come. Our revenge is at hand. Our armies have finally reached the very gates of Escann itself. Yet, what we find is not the empire that once drew us away, for it seems that Castanor is long dead, our vengeance stolen from us by these so-called orcs. No matter. Orc or human, they’ll all look the same once their bones have been trampled into dust."
 I89_break_castan_spine_title:0 "§OBreak Castan Spine§!"
 I89_break_castan_spine_desc:0 "The storm has descended upon Escann, and Escann has buckled and broken. We have, in mere decades, avenged a millenia-old injustice. Those who once oppressed us, who killed us, who expelled us, now look upon us with fear in their eyes. Their homes burn. Their cities crumble. Their people die. And yet, our vengeance is just beginning."
 I89_the_centaur_wrath_title:0 "§OThe Centaur Wrath§!"
 I89_the_centaur_wrath_desc:0 "Burn it. All of it. The cities, the towns, the fields, the forests, the hills, all of it. Only then, once the land has been swept clean, will it be returned to its proper place. Under the dominion of centaurkind. Through fire and blood, in Escann, the storm shall be reborn anew."
 
 I89_face_the_desert_elves_title:0 "§OFace the Desert Elves§!"
 I89_face_the_desert_elves_desc:0 "It seems we are not the only rising empire in these lands. Beyond the southern mountains, lie a group who call themselves the Jadd, whose cavalry hordes seem almost a match for our own. Almost. We will train, we will drill, and ensure our armies the mightiest the world has yet seen. Then, we shall ride south, and overwhelm the Jaddari in endless storm."
 I89_twilight_title:0 "Twilight"
 I89_twilight_desc:0 "The light of the Jadd has been extinguished. The last of the desert elves have been subjugated. The golden highway is now trod upon by endless centaur legions. WIth the crossroads of the world under our control, our Caehnate is free to march ever onwards. The storm engulfs the light, and it is far from satisfied."
 I89_the_tiger_pride_title:0 "§OThe Tiger Pride§!"
 I89_the_tiger_pride_desc:0 "To the east, beyond the deserts, lies Rahen, an empire greater than any other we have yet seen, at least in terms of size and wealth. Practically, however, it is mired in corruption, internal conflict, and disunity. In other words, ripe for conquest. Our armies shall cross into their jungles in untold numbers, and soon enough, our Caehn shall stand before a palace in Dhenjinsar. Then they shall raze it to rubble. For soon enough, the storm will destroy the tiger."
 I89_under_one_khan_title:0 "Under One Caehn"
 I89_under_one_khan_desc:0 "Finally, after a millennia of wars and skirmishes, we are united. Every centaur, in every corner of the world, has sworn fealty to our Caehn. The dust kicked up by our hooves blot out the sky, and the sounds of our charge deafens any standing ahead of us, before they are pounded into dust. The storm has coalesced, and now, the world will face its fury."
 I89_the_more_the_merrier_title:0 "The More the Merrier"
 I89_the_more_the_merrier_desc:0 "The nations around us, these puny, pitiful nations, seek to band together against us. It would almost be cute if it weren’t so pitiful. All that they have done is provide more targets for our endless tide of war.Together or alone, all shall be swept away by the endless storm. "
 I89_the_ever_growing_hoof_title:0 "§OThe Ever-Growing Hoof§!"
 I89_the_ever_growing_hoof_desc:0 "It seems that our conquests are only speeding up. Each and every day, more land is brought within the Caehnate’s grasp. Who cares if some is not full accounted for by bureaucrats? Who cares if not all our subjects are visited by tax collectors? There are wars to be one, lands to be conquered, armies to be defeated, and a storm to lead."
 
 I89_four_legged_tide_title:0 "Four Legged Tide"
 I89_four_legged_tide_desc:0 "The orcs have long been the terror of the humans of the west, destroying our ancient foe of Castanor. They are a warlike race, relishing in the thrill of battle and the glory of war. In many ways they are kindred spirits to centaurkind. As such, they will surely present a worthy foe! May the battlefields run red with the blood of centaur and orc blood, as their tide clashes with our own! Of course, the victor of these conflicts will obviously be us."
 I89_failed_race_title:0 "Failed Race"
 I89_failed_race_desc:0 "What have goblins ever accomplished? Little more than nuisances to the rest of the races, they pose little threat to the Caehn’s empire. Yet, these upstarts seem to think that they can face us on equal footing, throw us off as they have thrown off the dwarves and orcs. No matter. They will learn their place as their faces are pounded in by the stampede."
 I89_slow_target_title:0 "Slow Target"
 I89_slow_target_desc:0 "The ogres, mighty as they may be, are nonetheless little more than lumbering brutes, mere target practice for our archers. That is not to underestimate their raw strength, of course, but no matter how strong they may be, it won't matter at all when our forces cannot even be touched."
 I89_everything_in_the_brain_title:0 "Everything in the Brain"
 I89_everything_in_the_brain_desc:0 "It seems the gnomes consider themselves the most intelligent race on Halann, and that they may well be, with their fancy artifice and tactics. Yet, what else do they have? Their bodies are short and frail, not even capable of taking on a halfling, let alone a mighty centaur. We will teach them the greatest and last lesson they will ever learn; brawn beats brains."
 I89_years_of_age_title:0 "Years of Age"
 I89_years_of_age_desc:0 "The elves are by far the longest-lived, and most magically gifted, of the mortal races, and with age, they tell us, comes wisdom. It is clear to us, however, that all that comes of age and elven magic is decadence. We must put these decrepit old fools in their place once and for all, and teach them that wisdom and magic are nothing in comparison to the thunder of hooves."
 I89_with_one_hoof_title:0 "With Just One Hoof"
 I89_with_one_hoof_desc:0 "The kobolds, of all races, seek to defeat us! When we can crush each one underfoot with barely any effort, the only advantage they seem to have is numbers. Yet, is that truly an advantage, when each new kobold sent to the battlefield will simply be yet another corpse beneath the stampede? Therefore, kobolds will continue to do what they’ve always done; get themselves killed."
 I89_stay_in_your_mountains_title:0 "Stay in Your Mountains"
 I89_stay_in_your_mountains_desc:0 "The Serpentspine, with its cramped tunnels and dark caves, are far from ideal for the Caehnate. The dwarves can have their tunnels, all we require is that they stay in them. Any dwarvern incursion into the surface world, which rightfully belongs to the centaurs, will be met with overwhelming and unstoppable force."
 I89_rumble_in_the_jungle_title:0 "Rumble in the Jungle"
 I89_rumble_in_the_jungle_desc:0 "Once, the harimari arose from beasts to great warriors. Once, they conquered a continent in a single generation. Once, they lead the greatest empires Haless has ever seen. Yet, all that is now in the past; the harimari are a mere shadow of their former selves, their empires crumbling with age. Where there empires once stood, we shall build a new one, to make the empire of Harimar’s empire a mere footnote in the history of the centaur conquest of Haless."
 I89_by_the_halberd_title:0 "By the Halberd"
 I89_by_the_halberd_desc:0 "The humans are by far the most populous race of Halann, and have plagued centaurkind for millenia, driving us further and further away from our ancestral home, tormenting us even in our exile in the plains of the east. No more! For every centaur life taken, for every piece of land seized, the humans will pay a hundredfold."
 I89_army_without_state_title:0 "Army Without a State"
 I89_army_without_state_desc:0 "The hobgoblins. Perhaps the only race to build a military anywhere near as powerful as ours. Yet, they insist on enslaving their subjects, growing stagnant on the fat of their conquests. Their armies, though mighty, will represent a mere speedbump on the road to the Caehn’s domination of all of Haless."
