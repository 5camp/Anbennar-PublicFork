 high_philosophy_events.0.t:0 "The Schools of High Philosophy"
 high_philosophy_events.0.d:0 "We have recently seen the wisdom of the philosophers of Rahen. Their insight in the best way to live our lives and society, so that we might ascend to the heights of the high gods, is clearly of vital importance. However now that we have joined their ranks of philosophers, it's clear that, among their ways of thought, they are also quite divided as to what certain key reliefs and friezes mean that have been found in the High Temples. Several different schools of learning have appeared at our court. To whom should we turn for their wisdom?"

 high_philosophy_events.1.t:0 "Mutual Respect between the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool]"
 high_philosophy_events.1.d:0 "There have never been any theological differences worth a real conflict between the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool] schools and both customs often exist side by side.\nThe long-lasting cooperation between the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and the [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool] [school_opinion_increase_country.GetAdjective] states has, however, lead to a new era of mutual understanding and respect."

 high_philosophy_events.2.t:0 "[Root.GetReligiousSchool] and [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool] Normalize Relations"
 high_philosophy_events.2.d:0 "For some time the relationship between the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and the [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool] have been strongly colored by distrust and conflict. Some scholars have gone as far as to denounce the theologians of the other school and their followers.\nHowever, tensions have been greatly lessened in recent years and with [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and [school_opinion_increase_country.GetAdjective] [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool] scholars leading the way towards tolerance and coexistence."

 high_philosophy_events.3.t:0 "The philosophers and the [Root.GetAdjective] - [school_opinion_decrease_country.GetAdjective] War"
 high_philosophy_events.3.d:0 "The prolonged conflict between the [school_opinion_decrease_country.GetAdjective] and the [Root.GetAdjective] is starting to spill into the philosophical realm. Mutual respect and tolerance is on an all time low and [school_opinion_decrease_country.GetReligiousSchool] thought is being marginalized in [Root.GetAdjective] society."
