 rogieria_crown_farranean_title:0 "The Crown of Farraneán"
 rogieria_crown_farranean_desc:0 "Farraneán was once a realm which existed where Rogieria now stands. The march of the Greentide did not slaughter every Escanni in its wake, especially here along the borders with the Empire of Anbennar and Ibevar.\n\nIn the mountains of Valefort live the surviving members of the Síl na Eán family, the former rulers of Farraneán. If Rogier could take one as a wife, it would make the Silmuna the rightful monarchs of this land and give the returning Farrani good reasons to accept our rule."
 
 rogieria_black_tree_title:0 "The Black Tree"
 rogieria_black_tree_desc:0 "Whistlevale was once the beating heart of Farraneán, center of its realm. While many Farrani have returned to their former realm and original homes, the cities are mostly in ruins. As per the deal with Margery, Rogier agreed to restore Farraneán to its former glory, and Whistlevale is the first step.\n\nBy restoring the cities and populating the countryside, we will attract more than just Farrani refugees to our realm, but sellswords and businessmen alike -- future allies and pawns for Rogier to use in his plans."
 
 rogieria_restore_caseans_title:0 "Restore the Caseáns"
 rogieria_restore_caseans_desc:0 "The Caseáns originated as  a type of fortified location, similar to a castle or fortress, designed with the intention of combatting the victims of the White Pestilence. Later, they became key strongpoints in defense of Farraneán .\n\nRestoring these landmarks  will keep much of Rogieria’s core territory safe, and grant us a strong position to launch further expansion and reclamation."

 rogieria_cogauluis_ball_title:0 "The Cogaulúis Ball"
 rogieria_cogauluis_ball_desc:0 "After decades of hard work, the lands of Farraneán enjoy a prosperity that even surpasses the pre-Greentide times. The cities were rebuilt bigger than before, the roads are safe and the farmlands produced a record harvest.\n\nIn order to celebrate the restoration of Farraneán, Margery proposed to celebrate a Cogaulúis Ball, a custom that the first Farrani, from Esmari origin, brought to their new homes. A river party where the waters of the Cogaulúis become filled with light, laughter and music. And, of course, Margery’s wishes are Rogier's commands."
 
 rogieria_vincen_body_title:0 "Exhume Vincen"
 rogieria_vincen_body_desc:0 "With the darkness of the night as their veil, our Imperial allies and agents will sneak into an Istralorian cemetery in the search of Vincen's grave, hidden after the end of the fourth Lilac war. It seems strange that Vincen, former Grand Duke of Dameria and Emperor of Anbennar would rest eternally here, and yet perhaps hiding his corpse in plain sight was the best decision.\n\nIn a grave marked for ‘Aldowle síl Dameria’ lies the great Old Owl. Now let our agents retrieve his body and be off into the night, to return him to his family."
 
 rogieria_crown_dameria_title:0 "The Crown of Dameria"
 rogieria_crown_dameria_desc:0 "Many treasures were lost with the fall of the Silmuna and the sack of Anbenncóst. One of them was the crown of the Kingdom of Dameria, made by elven artisans for Marion Silmuna, the founder of the Silmuna dynasty.\n\nOne of our supporters gave us information that although the crown was stolen by Rose Party soldiers, it never left Anbenncóst. We need to send spies to the city to verify this information, and if possible, recover a shard of our legacy."
 
 rogieria_emulant_vincen_title:0 "Emulant of Vincen"
 rogieria_emulant_vincen_desc:0 "Among the heroes of house Silmuna Vincen is perhaps the one who understood most deeply what Anbennar -- unity -- truly stands for. A master diplomat, his sincere words brought more allies to his side than Lorentish treachery could ever hope to take away.\n\nThere wasn't a court in Cannor unhappy to greet him as a guest. Even the Lorentish nobles wished to gain his favor, as he wed Eilís Siloriel to end the First Lilac War. After the death of Queen Reanna III Siloriel, Vincen vowed to enforce the rightful succession according to Lorentish law, first by pushing his wife Eilis' claim, then his son Adenn's.\n\nHad it not been for the treachery of the roses, he would have succeeded, finally defeated Dameria's greatest rival, and brought all of Anbennar and Lencenor to heights of prosperity hitherto unknown. We will set our sights just as high, and not fail."
 
 rogieria_right_hand_title:0 "The Right Hand"
 rogieria_right_hand_desc:0 "The Wexonards unlawfully annexed the provinces of Varivar and Eargate after the Invasion of Damesear. Ever since, the loyal subjects of the Silmuna have been living under tyrants.\n\nIf we are going to reclaim our rightful place on the throne, it is imperative that we secure this vital defensive position against the mainland. It should be straightforward enough to contact the old Damerian loyalists, and a network among them will make claiming our rightful lands easier."
 
 rogieria_the_soul_title:0 "The Soul"
 rogieria_the_soul_desc:0 "On the southern side of the Damesear is the foremost temple of the cult of the Dame. The Silmuna are direct descendants of Auci, an avatar of the Dame, so in a sense her continued worship is both a source of national pride, and legitimizes the Silmuna bloodline.\n\nWe should do our utmost to ensure the loyalty of those who control this sacred landmark, and if we can’t, we can at least ensure that safe travel to and from the area is guaranteed."

 rogieria_rogierian_nobility_desc:0 "The Sons of Dameria were in no small part composed of nobles who lost everything when Dameria was butchered by the traitors. As we marched against the Greentide, former lords stood no higher than commoners.\n\nNow, Rogier sees fit to grant these loyal nobles new fiefs in the northern lands of the former kingdom of Adenica, but their time as brothers-in-arms with the common man has had a particular effect on the nobles of Rogieria.\n\nThey do not view themselves as superior – how could they, when they stood and fought and died side-by-side – and in their new fiefdoms they conduct themselves not so much as rulers, but as leaders, making common cause with their people."
 
 rogieria_heart_valley_title:0 "The Heart of the Valley"
 rogieria_heart_valley_desc:0 "Queen Margery was raised on stories of Farranean’s prestigious capital, a prosperous city, a nexus of trade between East and West. When she and the king saw Escin themselves, it was little more than collapsing ruins and burnt-out shells.\n\nIt is of great importance to her majesty that it be restored without delay. So it shall be! Call for the workmen, the settlers, the returning Farrani! Escin shall be Farranean’s beating heart once again!"
 
 rogieria_for_young_owl_title:0 "For the Young Owl!"
 rogieria_for_young_owl_desc:0 "Many Damerians came to Escann before and after the Greentide, from crowded Anbenncóst, the old woods of East Dameria or the bountiful farmlands of West Dameria. Pioneers, fortune-seekers and Marcher Lords. Loyalists and traitors, but Damerians nevertheless.\n\nIf we want to see a Silmuna ruling from Anbenncóst again, we need to remind them of our common origin to make them fight for our just cause. As per Rogier’s command, we will give special attention to their lands, to remind them of the benevolent rule of the Silmunas."
 
 rogieria_fate_silmuna_title:0 "Fate of the Silmuna"
 rogieria_fate_silmuna_desc:0 "It was not so long ago that the Silumnas ruled Dameria from the Imperial Palace in Annbencost, and now where are they? Dead? Exiled? The fate of so many of our kin has been left to the records of traitors and usurpers.\n\nIt is no wonder then that our lost are  so hard to find. Let us begin our hunt where it ended, the city of Annbencóst: Where the Fourth Lilac war ended, where Silmuna dominion over the empire ended."
 
 rogieria_adenns_body_title:0 "Exhume Adenn"
 rogieria_adenns_body_desc:0 "On some obscure cliff lies a clumsily marked grave in Old Damenath that overlooks the South Dameshead. Our findings in Anbenncóst have led us here, to this somber scene.\n\nSuch a tragedy is enough to bring tears to the eye of a Silmuna, but not today. Today we have come with a purpose, not to mourn, but to exhume the corpse of Adénn "Skylance" Silmuna. Father of Rogier the Exiled, son of Vincen "The Old Owl" Silmuna, and the last Grand Duke of Dameria. Now, let us take him far from this sorrowful sight and give him a proper burial worthy of his stature."

 rogieria_left_hand_desc:0 "The Magisterium has a strong hold over the western gate of the Damesear. Despite having strong ties with our family, they ultimately remained neutral in the Lilac Wars.\n\nIf we could convince them to support our return, it would make the transition of power once we enact our plans much easier. Otherwise, perhaps we could use some old claims to force them into accepting our hegemony."
 
 rogieria_the_heart_title:0 "The Heart"
 rogieria_the_heart_desc:0 "Anbenncost was - no, is the capital of Dameria, the location of the Imperial Palace, and the former seat of the Silmuna. Even after its sack in 144, the city remains by far the most important in Anbennar, and certainly the largest in all of Cannor.\n\nThe Anbenncoster peoples have enjoyed their time in the sun as a free city, but they know their true loyalties lie with the moon. It is time for them to return to the fold."
 
 rogieria_loyalist_waiting_title:0 "Loyalists Waiting"
 rogieria_loyalist_waiting_desc:0 "Thousands of true Damerians across the empire now know of our resurgence, and we have consolidated the base of our power. Our influence is so pronounced, people are publically holding festivals in our honor, holding rallies to further support for us, and making preparations for the day our banner flies above the Imperial Palace once more.\n\nThe Silmuna name has never been more celebrated, and we haven’t even made our proper return yet. The time is soon nigh. It won’t be much longer until we shall march to the Damesear with a grand reception, we simply must convince a final few nations of the righteousness of our cause."
 
 #Third Slot
 
 rogieria_last_silmuna_title:0 "The Last Silmuna"
 rogieria_last_silmuna_desc:0 "Our bloodline goes back to the origins of the Empire itself. From Auci of Dameria and Munas Moonsinger we are descended. Now, standing at the helm of this venerable lineage is Rogier 'The Young Owl' Silmuna.\n\nAlthough he is not the child of Rogier 'the Exiled', none is more deserving than him to bear that name, as he is the son of the Greentide hero Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna. With such a worthy ruler leading our nation, great things are in our future! But it is a future shaped by deeds, not merely words -- what legacy will we create?"
 
 rogieria_sons_of_dameria_title:0 "Sons of Dameria"
 rogieria_sons_of_dameria_desc:0 "When Rogier the Exiled fled from our homeland, he went in pursuit of his sister Eilís, and he did it with his loyal subjects and friends, veterans of the Lilac wars all of them. Though many years have passed since he left for Escann and he now rests in peace, many of his followers remain alive in our new nation.\n\nThose who were squires when they left Dameria became great warriors fighting the Greentide. The experience of these nobles-turned-adventurers should not go to waste, let us have them train our army and restore their ranks as our new nobility, to reward and ensure loyalty in generations to come."
 
 rogieria_young_owl_ambition_title:0 "The Young Owl's Ambition"
 rogieria_young_owl_ambition_desc:0 "During his time with the Corintar, Rogier was always eclipsed by his father and older brother. Neither physically strong nor pious, his strength lay in his sharp mind and his charisma, but he had resigned himself to always being in the shadow.\n\nBut now that has changed. In the moment that the crown was offered to him a flame grew in him. He will not only recover what is his birthright, he will make a name of his own, a name that will cast a shadow upon the rest of his family, a legacy for the ages. The Young Owl's legacy."
 
 rogieria_kingdom_rogier_title:0 "A Kingdom for Rogier"
 rogieria_kingdom_rogier_desc:0 "The former lands of Adenica lie in a fertile plain irrigated by the waters of the Tarescker. Formerly inhabited by the Adennerknight-lords, it is now divided between Cannorian adventurers and settlers and the Escanni survivors.\n\nRogier has decided that the former Kingdom of Adenica will become the heart of the new Kingdom of Rogieria, and the first step is to claim and consolidate the Taran plains. Nevertheless, his main concern is not the land, but the people who inhabit it, since the core of his kingdom must be people loyal to him and the Silmuna family."
 
 rogieria_city_rogier_title:0 "The City of Rogier"
 rogieria_city_rogier_desc:0 "Taranton was the capital of the knightly Kingdom of Adenica but now lies in ruins. It is not the same smoldering, goblin-infested, ruin we reclaimed, but the city has seen better days.\n\nIts past history, its position in the center of Rogier’s domains and its access to the swift Tarescker river makes the city an excellent site for Rogieria’s capital. Rogier himself has taken the project under his wing, designing the new city in the outskirts of Taraton on the eastern bank of the Tarescker. He spends his free time tracing roads, designing buildings and demarcating the districts of his legacy, the shining beacon of West Castanor, the city of Rogier."
 
 rogieria_reclamation_army_title:0 "Reclamation Army"
 rogieria_reclamation_army_desc:0 "We must establish a magnificent army, one fit for our glorious nascent kingdom, to strike fear into the hearts of the traitors both in Escann and Anbennar as we march across the land. But while many of our citizens cry out to return to our forefather's homeland in Dameria, just as many wish to stay in the land of second chances, fearful that an invasion of the Empire will leave their Escanni homes defenseless. The Young Owl himself is not an exception, as his newly founded kingdom is as precious to him as Dameria was for Rogier the Exiled."

And though he could not find r his sister Eilís the Blue, he found a nephew, and forged a nation..\n\nTruly, Rogier was a valiant man, never seeking glory or fame but  instead survival for his family and the noble bloodline of the Silumnas. Let us honor him, as his heirs, and celebrate both his life and death equal to that of other great Silmunas before him."

The remains of the Lilac War heroes have been recovered, from the Old Owl to Rogier the Exiled. Now we must give them a burial worthy of their legacy.\n\nAs we carry on the torch we must not forget the fire from which we lit it. To that purpose, [Root.GetCapitalName] will serve us well. A mausoleum must be built to house the great rulers of the past and it shall be built with the magnificence and care that these rulers put into our people.

Yet how can we rest when so many of our people still dream of returning home, to the rolling hills of the Damesear. To sail in the waters of the Dameshead or to walk the bustling streets of Anbenncóst.\n\nOur people will not be ignored for we have the tools at our disposal. The might of Escann and loyal allies that support our return. The road home will be flanked with the Silmuna emblem!"

 rogieria_challenge_made_desc:0 "In 1443 the Grand Duke Adenn "Skylance" Silmuna was murdered in the Imperial Palace of Anbenncost by the treacherous Erlan of Wesdam. How ironic that the slaughter of our forefathers served only to bring about a brighter future upon our house.\n\nBeyond Anbennar, we have twice-proven our rightful claim to an empire, making it clear as moonlight.We have revived Escann and left behind a legacy that will eclipse Castanor, and who could deny that our subjects have better lives under our rule? We saved Escann from anarchy, we will now save the Empire from unrightful rulership."

But what use is legacy with nobody to whom it can be passed on?\n\nThe Silmunas were all but wiped out in the Lilac Wars, save the king's uncle, Rogier 'the Exiled', and his great father, Lothane 'Bluetusk'.

Just as Adénn was a great guardian to his people, so shall his tower forever guard Rogieria."

 rogieria_rogierian_tea_title:0 "Lothane's Blue"
 rogieria_rogierian_tea_desc:0 "Though originally introduced to Cannor by the elves, tea has become synonymous with Damerian culture. It is only natural that we carry on such treasured traditions in our new home.\n\nFurthermore, the difficulty of imports from Anbennar has encouraged some farmers to develop new varieties; indeed, one known as Lothane’s Blue has gained particular popularity amongst our people – gaining its unusual hue by the same magical means as the traditional Elven Silver."

Furthermore, as one of our line, his life forged a bond between us and the knightly order unique in Escann.

And so I invite you to my domain of Valefort, for her, and so that the people of Farraneán can know their future king, if Ryala wishes it."\n\nRogier was rarely nervous before even the fiercest battle, but he was nervous as he entered the Caseán's reception feast. Despite appearing human-like than his father and brother, it didn't change the fact that orc blood ran through his veins. While the Corintari saw in him the son of the Grandmaster Lothane Bluetusk, and the Rogierians see in him the heir of Rogier the Exiled, he know how his kind was seen in most Escann.\n\nMargery was sitting on the other side of a table. Tall and regal, with her long brown hair tied up in a braid, she made a gesture with the hand, indicating to Rogier to sit. And then she talked. And Roger was stunned. She had deduced Rogier's designs, and she didn't want to be a mere pawn in his plans, so she proposed a deal. She would accept the marriage proposal if Rogier promised to restore Farraneán, his people and culture to its former glory.\n\nRogier left for the trip with a plan. He returned with a plan, and the woman who would be the love of his life."

Their expeditions into the nooks and crannies which line that great city have uncovered many things, the newest of which is a handsome find indeed - the handsomest of all.\n\nFor the Crown of Dameria, once thought lost, is now found. Once a circlet of the purest silver, adorned with various precious stones, it was made for Marion Silmuna, the son of Auci Eightborn and Munas Moonsinger - the first dynast of the House of Silmuna.\n\nIt came into our hands splintered, for it was broken when Anbenncóst fell - by who, none know. Nevertheless, through several long and trying ordeals, our spies were able to retrieve all of its fragments as well as a few of the jewels. The next logical step, then, is to decide what is to be done with it."

The Young Owl turned his attention back to the maps spread out on the table: A map of Dameria, a map of the old kingdoms of Escann, and a map of the new adventurer kingdoms.\n\nHe focused his gaze on Dameria, the land of his ancestors: her reconquest would make sure that his name will never be forgotten. But he couldn't invade the Empire, not yet at least. Although Rogieria was born with a strength never seen in Escann since the Greentide, thanks to the efforts of his uncle and the Sons of Dameria, it's not enough. Rogier needs a plan if he wants to recover his birthright and ensure his legacy. A plan to fulfill his ambition.\n\nRogier shifted his eyes to the Escann maps. He grabbed a quill and marked three points on the map.\n\nIn the western vale, the former kingdom of Farraneán. The Síl na Eán family still rules a remnant in the mountains of Valefort. A royal marriage with the family will make Rogier the legitimate ruler of the Forlorn Vale, giving him an edge with the other adventurer kingdoms.\n\nIn the core of his realm, the former lands of Adenica. A new capital needs to be designed and erected to act as the heart of the new kingdom. Cities need to be built and fields to be plowed.\n\nIn the northern woods and swamps, the lands of Balmire. The shores of the Alen are dangerous and represent a weekness in Rogieria’s defenses. Restoring the former Castanorian Citadel would secure Rogier’s kingdom while allowing the riches of the north to flow south.\n\nRogier left the quill, and contemplated the map. He dreamed of his future kingdom, and smiled."

A thousand soldiers, armed with spears and swords, bows and crossbows, shields and banners, all wearing the emblem of the exiles. All bearing it with pride.\n\nA thousand men and women, humans and half-orcs, bearing the weapons of their ancestors. The same weapons that protected all of Cannor in Rottenstep; that followed Corin into battle; that conquered the old kingdoms of Farraneán, Adenica and Bal Mire; that heard the speech of the Young Owl in the ruins of Taraton.\n\nMore shouts: ”The Emperors have returned! The Silmuna have returned home! Long live Dameria!” With their silver coffins carried by the Sons, and escorted by all the loyal friends and subjects of Dameria, Vincen and Adéen, Rogier and Lothane, and all the former kings of Rogieria marched through the street, with the people cheering them as if they were alive, returning victorious to home from battle. Marching to their final resting place, a new Mausoleum near the Imperial Palace, forever guarded by the Sons, and the sons of the Sons.\n\nBut there was someone missing in the celebration. In the city that He founded, under the soil of the kingdom that He raised, guarded by the Knight-Kings of old, and in company of his beloved wife, the Young Owl rests.

There they found their grandfather Vincen talking with his father Aldres; their brothers, Reán and Maurise were laughing at the expenses of young Tomar; And they were his fathers, near two empty chairs.
