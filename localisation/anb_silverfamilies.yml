   silverfamilies.silmuna.t:0 "The House of Silmuna"
   silverfamilies.silmuna.d:0 "The House of Silmuna is one of the greatest of the Silver Families, originating with the marriage of Munas Moonsinger, who led the Remnant Fleet to Cannor and later led the League of Free Realms against the Sorcerer-King, and Auci Damerid, the Queen of Dameria and avatar of the Dame; goddess of the harvest, knowledge and magic. The Silmunas were the Grand Dukes of Dameria joining the Empire of Anbennar, and were the dynasty most frequently on the imperial throne - some even viewed the Silmunas as the only rightful rulers of Anbennar. The dynasty was destroyed following the Lilac Wars, when the Grand Duchy of Dameria was dissolved after the victory of the Rose Party and the Silmunas lost their territories save for a Rose-aligned branch in Wesdam. Of the dynastic branch that once ruled the Grand Duchy, only Rogier Silmuna survived as Captain of the Sons of Dameria adventurer company. The House of Silmuna is known for its magical power, patronage of the arts, and political ambition."

This would result in a victory for Lorent’s Rose Party, though several duchies under cadet houses in the Bay of Wines would break away from the Kingdom’s control.
