 castes_estate_events.1.d:0 "A human playwright, going by the name Dhanneh Leihner, is rapidly gaining fame among the common folk. His plays are tactless vernacular pieces of garbage, yet the humans in the [Root.GetMiddle CastesName] and [Root.GetLower CastesName] love them!\n\nIt is an outrage! The plays are cheap comedy and aim to make a mockery of the [Root.GetUpper CastesName]. Contemptuous titles range from "The Mind of a Married Harimari" to "Harimar & Manava Go to White Castle", and his most recent play "Dude, Where's My Horse?" makes a mockery of all the virtues we hold in respect. \n\nWe must take control of the situation!"
