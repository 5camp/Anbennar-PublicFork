 estate_adventurers_spirit_hunters:0 "Spirit Hunters"
 estate_adventurers_spirit_hunters_desc:0 "Adventurers are all proficient at monster-slaying and quest-completing, that is their trade. But a select few are able to handle the trickiest challenges of Haless: spirits. With enchanted blade and well-studied ritual, hostile spirits can be driven back, if not banished entirely. If we fund these adventurers, the spirit world will undoubtedly be less of a threat."
 estate_adventurers_temple_quest_licenses:0 "Temple Quest Licenses"
 estate_adventurers_temple_quest_licenses_desc:0 "The High Temples of Haless have always been a font of mystery, but one highly resilient to exploration. Now, with the invention of the Korashi Drill, we can bypass the temples' magical wards and delve into their secret chambers and hidden passages. It will not be cheap to sponsor adventurers on such an expedition, and it may offend some, but we cannot even begin to imagine the value of what might be waiting within."
 estate_mages_spirit_speakers:0 "Spirit Speakers"
 estate_mages_spirit_speakers_desc:0 "Mystics across Haless claim to have ways of connecting directly to the spirit world and speaking to its denizens. Some use elaborate rituals, others intense hallucinogenics, yet others a unique spell passed down through generations. Such behavior is rare in court, but if we task our mages with figuring out a true way to commune with our ancestors, who knows what we may learn?\n\n§YEnables Ancestral Communion events§!"

 estate_mages_temple_desecrators_desc:0 "The High Temples are filled with traps, guardians, and defenses meant to keep those not meant to be there out. To overcome these trials, powerful and specialized dark magic is required. Let's train our sorcerers in these techniques and send them on expeditions."
 artifice_invention_korashi_drills:0 "Korashi Drills"
 artifice_invention_korashi_drills_desc:0 "Magic-forged steel. A nugget of damestear as power-source. And at the tip, a sharp point of black damestear, long known to the Halessi as Korashi. These are the components of the Korashi Drill, and with it, we can nullify the High Temples' wards and defenses, and begin excavation of these ancient Precursor complexes..."

 spirits.008.a:0 "Brilliant!"
 spirits.010.t:0 "The Plundering of [Root.GetName]"
 spirits.010.d:0 "Having recently conquered the province of [Root.GetName], we have made a discovery of potentially great magnitude concerning the local Temple Complex! We have learned that those who previously had control of the Temple Complex were using Korashi Drills to plunder and pillage its ancient relics.\n\nWhile such actions will surely be frowned upon by some, it cannot be denied that they also present great opportunities for ancient riches and wisdom to be attained.\nHow should we proceed?"

 spirits.012.t:0 "Temple Heart Discovered!"
 spirits.012.da:0 "Deep, deep within the great Temple Complex of [Root.GetName], where our excavation teams have been searching for relics and valuables to extract, we have found something!\n\nAt the very heart of the Temple Complex there lies a massive chamber; ornate designs decorate the walls and ancient reliefs depict the great spirits of the past.\nHowever, when they first entered the room, it was not the walls that drew our people’s attention, but the core. The immense orb gently hovers in the middle of the room and slowly pulses with energy, almost as if it were a beating heart.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the core is made of Damestear and is most likely the source of power for the Complex’s defenses. It is undoubtedly important for the Temple Complex and its functions, but our Artificers and Mages are both clamoring for access to the artifact. Furthermore, the core presents a practical treasure trove of Damestear and could fetch us a high price if mined.\n\nWhat should we do with this Heart of the Temple?"

 spirits.014.d:0 "A gnomish master artificer at the institute of [temple_inquiry_institute_target.GetName] has published a paper which outlines a potential method of bypassing the defenses of High Temples. They hypothesize that, through the use of an exotic material recovered from Oni settlements, the potent magical defenses surrounding the High Temples might be breached, allowing access to whatever terrible wonders lie within. While this so-called Korashi material is scarce, gnomes at the institute have already begun work on a reliable method of production."

After numerous unsuccessful tests resulting in the nullification of some rather expensive magical equipment, the Mk. 5 DOLG Korashi drill has penetrated the Temple Complex of [korashi_drill_test_province.GetName]’s entry wards. Already the temple’s antechambers are filled with enterprising gnomish archaeologists, although further exploration into the antediluvian structure has been prevented by some truly devious trapmaking."

Already reports have reached us of small wonders in the complex’s superficial chambers and the spirits only know what miracles lie deeper within."

While many are repulsed by the still potent temple defences, their efforts have been growing more and more successful. Now, as they plumb the deepest reaches of the temples, there are whispers of unimaginably powerful ancient artefacts, grand structures made entirely of damesTear, and huge hoards of lesser precursor relics."

How this will affect us remains to be seen."

 spirits.101.d:0 "Taking a short but needed break from their duties, our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] recently went out for a quiet stroll in a nearby forest. There, among the lush greenery where shadows danced from the setting sun, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] caught a glimpse of something white out of the corner of their eye. To get a better look, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] turned and found themself eye to eye with the ethereal White Tiger standing some distance away. After staring at each other for a while, the White Tiger left and could no longer be found.\n\nThe rumors spread quickly throughout the realm and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]’s guards and attendants were able to give testimony and credibility to the story: that our great [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] was visited by the elusive White Tiger. After all, the White Tiger is a spirit that is only rarely seen by mortals and is said to only reveal itself to the just and virtuous. Thus, our subjects all rejoice at the thought of their [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] having been chosen by the White Tiger."

All across the countryside there were sightings of the red horse spirits as they danced across the clouds, bringing luck and prosperity to all who saw their auroral drovings. We have also received reports from our horse breeders that several of their mares are mysteriously pregnant, confirming the rumours of their couplings with mortal horses."

Already teams of prospectors have set out to exploit this new wealth, setting up shrines to the unknown spirit in their new mineshafts. Meanwhile, the broken earth has caused some dismay amongst our surveyors, and they predict some difficulties developing the land until everything settles down."

 spirits.104.d:0 "While sneaking away from town to find a secluded place to cavort, a young couple in [Root.GetName] discovered a pristine hot spring, seemingly having appeared out of nowhere. The springs are guarded by a kindly turtle spirit, who, while voiceless, has been accepting offerings of coin and food from the people of the nearby towns in exchange for rejuvenating baths in the sulphurous springs. While we cannot begin to guess why they are here or when they will once again return to the spirit realm, the people of the region seem refreshed and content."

 spirits.107.d:0 "Yakshini or Jazaoni, depending on whether you are in Rahen or the Yanshen, are nature spirits that appear in the shape of women. They are mostly associated with the Saraco Raheni or Saraka plant. This plant is used across all of Haless in rituals as burning the plant gives off a sweet smell that is said to ward off evil spirits. Legends say that this sometimes attracts Yakshini spirits, who, loving the smell of the plant will hang around the place that burned it and bless the area with luck and fortune.\n\nThis has now seemed to have happened in the province of [spirit_province.GetName] after a burning ritual was performed. The locals ask if they may expand their shrines and request funds to increase the burning of Saraka in the hopes of keeping the spirit around."

 spirits.110.t:0 "Talented Shaman"
 spirits.110.d:0 "A travelling shaman has visited our court after having been rescued from bandits by our soldiers and offers their services to us as a thank you. They claim to be able to communicate with certain spirits and ask them to bless our nation with wisdom. They claim to have travelled many lands and have met many spirits, but that they have forged a unique bond with the following spirits:\n\nThe spirit of the Boabang peak. The Boabang peak is a mountain atop the Phokhao Range and the shaman has met this spirit while travelling to the Dwarven hold of Verkal Ozovar. When he got lost, it was the spirit who helped him find the way back to the right trail in exchange for keeping the lonely spirit company by travelling a longer route. They bonded and formed a unique kind of friendship with the shaman claiming to speak with the Boabang spirit regularly. They may ask the spirit to give us insight in mapping and pathfinding, which we can use to improve the functioning of our bureaucracy and taxation.\n\nThe spirit of the watersnake. When travelling across the rivers of the Lupulan rainforest in search of people to guide on spiritual matters. While originating from the region, they again got lost. That was until they encountered a wounded snake in the water. While locals would have seen the watersnake as dangerous and killed it, the shaman instead felt that something was different about the critter and decided to help it by removing a sharp tooth from its side and bandaging the wound. The watersnake then thanked the shaman by leaving an egg. When the shaman opened the egg, it contained some coins and a small bottle of liquor. And sometimes, the shaman claims, sometimes they find pieces of cloth, just like the bandage, as if the spirit is trying to return the "borrowed" bandage. The shaman may try to ask the watersnake for wisdom regarding water travel.\n\nThe White Tiger spirit. When traversing the jungles of Bomban, the shaman got lost again… Being desperate, the shaman tried multiple rituals to appease spirits and get help, yet nothing seemed to work until he heard something. In the distance they heard a faint cry from a tiger cub and decided to investigate it. They found the cub trapped in an old hunting trap and without a second thought decided to help the poor cub get out of the trap. Only then did they notice that the cub was all white with golden stripes. Not long after helping it did its mother appear, which was not only white, but a forest spirit herself. The tiger spirit helped the shaman by guiding them out of the jungle and claims to hear the tigers roar regularly when he is experiencing fear or doubt. The shaman hopes to communicate with the tiger spirit in the hopes of helping us attain a braver and nobler soldiery."\n\n The shaman gives us the option of one spirit to communicate with and gain their blessing"

 spirits.111.d:0 "The shamans of the Mystical Accord faith are well liked and respected as intermediaries between the corporeal and the spiritual. And sadly this trust is sometimes misused by frauds and tricksters as has now happened to us. A shaman claimed to be able to communicate with a great yet unknown spirit who could not only bless our court, but our whole nation. Our advisors were sceptical until the shaman performed a spirit summoning in front of our ruler themselves! In hindsight, it seems to have been a simple magic trick without any spiritual involvement to speak of. After having agreed to a ritual, the shaman requested preparation time and a private room. They then snuck away and stole money from our coffers, not having been seen ever since.\n\nWhat should be done about this embarrassing incident?"

These waterbirds are not treated well and some even see them as pests that should be eliminated. It now seems that a spirit has taken up the role of avenging them and is causing chaos in a small hamlet not far from the capital. The locals report that a goose is attacking any villager it comes across. We initially didn’t suspect a spirit yet the fact that this goose is using farming tools and small knives as weapons has given us a different perspective and we now suspect that the goose is either a spirit themselves or that a spirit has taken possession of a goose and is using it to spread chaos in the hamlet.

Their baying echoed through burning towns as they tore fleeing civilians limb from limb, watering the fields with blood. They have left several towns in ruin, and many homeless and poverty stricken. Then, just as quickly as they arrived, they vanished into the night. We do not know why these beasts have chosen to attack us, or if they will return."

Our guards in the region have reported familiar faces on the figures that walk within, old comrades slain in battle, great leaders from our nation’s past, all bearing the grisly wounds of war.

While it is usually used as a folk tale to scare children into behaving, it now seems to have manifested itself into reality. It appears that a spirit has taken on the identity of the folktale and is actually abducting children, good and bad alike. Many parents are afraid that their children will be taken away as well. This paranoia, combined with the disappearing children will hurt our population numbers in the area for the foreseeable future."

 spirits.153.d:0 "Haless is a continent with different spiritual and ritual practices in every hamlet, city or region. But all share some sort of veneration or respect for grandmothers, as they are the mothers of mother. This is done through either rituals, storytelling or unique traditions. Examples are a group of hamlets, deep in the Lupulan rainforest who mix the ashes of the deceased women into their farming soil so they can metaphorically give birth to food for the younger generations or the Phokhao sky cemeteries, where deceased grandmothers get mummified through the cold air and are regularly redressed and offered food, flowers, liquor and other goods so their ancestral spirits may look over the future generations.\n\nSamshimoni is a spirit who represents the grandmothers that are venerated and has been spotted regularly around cemeteries, ancestral shrines or other places of veneration, and sometimes repays the common people for their devotion as has happened now. It now seems that the province is blessed by Samshimoni as there is a spike in pregnancies and healthy births together with an increased amount of sightings of the Grandmother spirit.

This by itself is not surprising, as funerals are as much social events for communities as they are an opportunity to mourn for the people of [Root.GetName]. What was shocking was the sheer number of guests who came to pay their respects. A parade of unfamiliar faces, often wearing clothing that was decades, sometimes even centuries out of fashion. \n\nIt wasn’t until a few days later had the people realised what had happened. Ancestral spirits from across the lands had come to pay their respects. Generations upon generations of elders were in attendance.

This malevolent entity has been launching attacks and abducting people, with young women being the primary targets. These attacks occur during the night when most people are asleep. Orang Minyak seems to possess the uncanny ability to elude patrols and guards by moving silently on walls and ceilings.\n\nThe spirit incapacitates its victims by dripping oil into their mouths, causing them to fall into a coma-like state, and then carries them away into the darkness. Although most of the abducted individuals eventually return, they are deeply traumatized and refuse to communicate with anyone. Our suspicions about the intentions of this oily man are unclear, and as of now, there is no apparent solution to put an end to these horrifying attacks.

Strangely, they seem incapable of causing physical harm, as reports suggest they pass right through people without any tangible impact. Nevertheless, the terror they instill in the residents is genuine, leaving them demanding urgent action to expel these ghostly figures from the forest.\n\nThe fear and anxiety gripping the village have reached a breaking point, as the eerie nightly visits persist. The community seeks respite and a solution to end the haunting.

 spirits.167.d:0 "Harpies are an uncommon sight in the Xianjie, and many may never encounter one in their entire lives. Nonetheless, everyone is familiar with the tale of Blackfang, a story passed down to children to instill a clear lesson. Legend has it that Blackfang served as a guardian of a small shrine in [Root.GetName] until an angry mob, fueled by baseless accusations of baby-eating, ended her life. The truth of these allegations is highly doubtful, but the outcome was tragically real. According to the lore, Blackfang's spirit now roams the Xianjie, seeking retribution against those who falsely accuse others of crimes they did not commit. While many consider this tale a cautionary fable, it seems that Blackfang has manifested herself in [Root.GetName].\n\nA notoriously unpopular magistrate, known for making false accusations and sentencing locals to boost personal revenue, met a gruesome fate. Snatched by a harpy adorned with dark green wings, black claws, and fangs, the magistrate was dropped from an astonishing height of around 100 meters onto the pavement of a bustling townsquare. The impact turned the once-corrupt magistrate into a puddle of remains, leaving no doubt about the severity of the strike. In the aftermath, Blackfang swiftly flew away.\n\nDespite the sudden and brutal nature of the attack, the locals have not shied away from showing their gratitude. Offerings have been left at a local shrine to honor and thank the spirit for her actions. While some may view it as a mere tale, the occurrence in [Root.GetName] has sparked belief in the vengeful presence of Blackfang. Her legendary pursuit of justice against false accusations seems to have manifested in a truly unsettling manner, sending a powerful message that resonates with the people."

Many in the region proudly assert that their love has grown and deepened with the passage of time. This exceptional state of affairs is widely attributed to the benevolent influence of the lovespirit Shennong. It is believed that Shennong actively works to nurture and strengthen relationships, resulting in a robust social fabric and enduring bonds among the people of [Root.GetName].\n\nThe presence of Shennong's favor is evident in the flourishing love and unity that permeate the province.

Thanks to the guidance of Shennong, love blossoms, and the people of [Root.GetName] cherish a profound sense of contentment in their loving unions.

Regrettably, in [Root.GetName], this has become more of a norm than an exception, and suspicions point towards the involvement of the spirit called Shennong. Though formless, Shennong is known to wield influence over people's relationships and behaviors, both in positive and negative ways. Unfortunately, it appears that [Root.GetName] has experienced the negative consequences, with people now engaging in adultery almost openly.\n\nThis epidemic of infidelity is wreaking havoc on the province, tearing apart the social fabric and undermining its core values and norms. The widespread indulgence in adultery is profoundly damaging to the community, leading to fractured relationships, broken trust, and emotional turmoil. The province is facing a crisis as the bonds that once held people together are being strained, and the repercussions are far-reaching."

Some turn to magic, others to science, and a few venture into the realm of the unnatural. Our ruler has taken such a path, attempting to forge a pact with Ngoho, a spirit renowned in tales for bestowing immortality upon those who seek it.\n\nThe ceremony was conducted with great solemnity, involving ritual chanting by shamans and the burning of incense. In the midst of this sacred atmosphere, our ruler fervently called upon the spirit to grant them immortality. The room fell into a profound silence, and abruptly, all light vanished, replaced by a faint murmuring. During this moment of uncertainty, our ruler collapsed to the ground, while the shamans continued their chant.\n\nA few seconds later, [Root.Monarch.GetName] regained consciousness seemingly unchanged.

During this mysterious interlude, our ruler collapsed to the ground, while the shamans continued their chant.\n\nAfter a few seconds, [Root.Monarch.GetName] regained consciousness but complained of a powerful and sharp headache. The significance of this symptom remains uncertain, leaving us to ponder whether it heralds a foreshadowing of impending death or if our ruler narrowly escaped the clutches of mortality.

 spirits.173.d:0 "The usual tale of Pyolsong depicts her as an old lady who arrives unannounced in villages to aid the sick. However, in a horrifying twist of fate, a village in [Root.GetName] experienced the rare opposite. Pyolsong appeared to be on a vengeful mission as she entered the village and unleashed a sinister black smoke that swiftly spread throughout the entire community. As a consequence, nearly all the villagers fell ill with the pox, leaving them in a dire and desperate state.\n\nThe gravity of the situation necessitated urgent action, prompting the dispatch of the army to quarantine the province and prevent any further outbreak. Now, the fate of the villagers rests on the hands of time and the power of prayer. The once serene village now stands in the shadow of a dark and uncertain future, as they grapple with the devastating consequences of Pyolsong's wrathful visit. The people can only hope that their prayers and the efforts of the authorities will prove effective in containing the outbreak and alleviating the suffering of the afflicted."

 spirits.174.d:0 "Trade serves as the lifeblood of many Rahenni cities, and the commerce of porcelain, silk, and spices sustains their world. According to legend, these cities are protected by Vanyaras, benevolent spirits who watch over and safeguard merchants during their business endeavors. Recently, it appears that multiple merchants in [Root.GetName] have been blessed by the Vanyaras, experiencing a remarkable surge in profits and sales. The merchants believe that this sudden prosperity is a result of their unwavering honesty and honorable dealings with their customers, which may have been inspired by the influence of the Vanyaras.\n\nThis flourishing trade has not only benefitted the merchants but also brought about additional revenue for the state. The increased economic activity has brought prosperity to the region, fostering hope for a sustained period of growth. The people are hopeful that the favor of the Vanyaras will continue to bless their endeavors, ensuring a bright and prosperous future for the city and its inhabitants. As the cycle of virtuous commerce and divine protection intertwines, the spirit of honesty and honor in business dealings continues to strengthen, nurturing a harmonious relationship between the merchants and the spirits that watch over them."
 spirits.174.a:0 "As blood flows, so shall trade."
 spirits.175.t:0 "Vanyara, Protector of Quacksalvers"
 spirits.175.d:0 "Trade indeed serves as the lifeblood of many Rahenni cities, encompassing the exchange of prized commodities such as porcelain, silk, and spices that keep their world thriving. However, within this bustling commerce, the honesty of some merchants can be compromised due to factors like personal greed, misfortune, or naivete. Moreover, the spirit of Vanyara, the protector of merchants, is known to employ punishment as a means to address a wide range of misdeeds related to fair trade and honest dealings.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the province of [Root.GetName] seems to be facing such challenges. An alarming rise in quacksalvers has emerged, comprising fake doctors, dentists, faulty tool salesmen, and spice merchants peddling colored sand. This proliferation has caused significant financial strain as we endeavor to suppress these dishonest traders and provide compensation to those who have suffered due to their deceitful practices.\n\nThere are strong suspicions that Vanyara's influence may be at play in this distressing situation. Many of the quacksalvers we apprehended were once well-known and respected merchants who now express remorse for their unlawful activities, attributing their transgressions to the influence of the Vanyaras. This complex predicament calls for a concerted effort to restore integrity and ethics in trade within the province. It is crucial to address these issues to maintain the trust and prosperity that trade brings to Rahenni cities while upholding the spirit of Vanyara's protection over honest merchants."

 spirits.176.d:0 "The arrival of a crying child at birth is cause for celebration, as it signifies the gift of health. In the province of [Root.GetName], this joyous occasion has been amplified by a remarkable phenomenon: a prolonged period without any stillbirths or miscarriages. The absence of such tragedies has led to a rising population and filled the hearts of parents with happiness and joy. The people firmly believe that they are under the protective watch of Yinti, the guardian of the pregnant.\n\nThis divine protection has brought about not only the blessing of a growing population but also an abundance of joy and hope among the people. As the province experiences this period of sustained prosperity, it promises a bright and promising future ahead. The increased population is indeed a boon for the region, contributing to its growth and development. This providential intervention by Yinti has fostered a sense of gratitude and reverence among the people, reaffirming their faith in the benevolent forces that safeguard and nurture life."

 spirits.177.d:0 "The silence of a newborn is always a bad sign, but when a whole province is experiencing a dramatic increase in stillbirths and crib deaths, something is deeply wrong. This has happened in [Root.GetName], and the population is deeply disturbed and fearful of what is going on. Despite efforts, we have not been able to identify any poisoned water sources, disease-ridden crops, or any material causes. Thus, we believe that it is Yinti who is punishing the province. The reason behind this remains uncertain, but some elders in the province speak of infidelity and broken love as the possible cause."

 spirits.178.d:0 "The hungry are fed, the famished are strong. In multiple villages of [Root.GetName], which have long struggled with food shortages, a curious phenomenon has occurred—a kind of 'anti-famine'. We suspect that it is Preta, a spirit known for transforming the hungry into the satiated. According to some locals, the spirit has manifested itself as a happy, plump peasant. Interestingly, this blessing seems to be limited to those who reside in the area, and we are unsure how long it will last. Undoubtedly, this miracle will strengthen the province and its people."
 spirits.178.a:0 "Being fed on an empty stomach it seems?"
 spirits.179.t:0 "Preta, Eater of Saturation"
 spirits.179.d:0 "Stews turn to ash, soup to sand, and flesh to rock. In several villages of [Root.GetName], an inexplicable phenomenon has taken place – the inability to eat or find satiation. The suspected cause is the spirit called Preta, whose spiritual influence can alternately make the hungry satiated and the satiated hungry again. Although mostly invisible, Preta occasionally takes on the form of either a malnourished noble or a plump peasant. Tragically, many have already succumbed to this affliction, and we fear more will perish in the days to come.\n\nInterestingly, it seems that Preta's impact is confined to a specific area, as those who have left the affected region regain their ability to eat. The duration of this hunger plague remains uncertain, but it undoubtedly threatens devastation and depopulation in the affected area for a considerable period."

 spirits.180.d:0 "Sleeplessness is an experience that everyone encounters at times. While it may be a source of frustration for many, for Phi Am, it serves as a source of energy. This unique spirit thrives on the sleeplessness of others and, in turn, grants them a restful night's sleep. As Phi Am travels through Southern Haless, its powers have a widespread effect, benefiting a whole area simultaneously. Remarkably, our nation has now been touched by Phi Am's influence, and our citizens and soldiers feel revitalized and rejuvenated every single morning. The overall discipline of our people has significantly improved, and our nation is now well-rested. Let us hope that Phi Am remains with us for a considerable time, so we may continue to enjoy peaceful and refreshing slumbers."

No birds were chirping yet it was dawn, no wind chimes from the garding were singing yet you felt the wind on your face and there was no noise coming from the rest of the residential complex, yet it was to be a normal busy morning. And at that moment, while scratching an itch it dawned on you, that it was you who could not hear it./n/nShocked and terrified you screamed for the guards but they did not come and when you in fear and anger stormed out of your room, there were no guards, there were not even maids or servants in the hallways. Then all of a sudden you were touched by a sweaty palm and lunged back. It was the first minister who in panic handed you a note that reads: "Since last night, the whole city seems to have gone deaf, including you, me and even the animals." Panicked, you gather your advisors and generals and hold a meeting in deafening silence via writing you pass around to each other. News comes in that the whole nation is affected and chaos is boiling. We cannot hear them but the common folk scream for an explanation and action. We suspect that spirits are at play and that we must increase our devotion. But how are we even going to spread an explanation if more than half of the population can’t read, write or hear? And even then, how are we going to convey that sacrifices and prayer are to increase? This operation will cost us a fortune while our nation slips into chaos and our enemies may even take advantage of this, we must act quick and while it may be costly, it may also save our nation."

You hear wind chimes clinging in the breeze singing as well and scratching an itch, you hear your nails on your skin. You let out an almost deafening scream of happiness and storm out of the room, finding your guards smiling that they too have regained their hearing. You go to your first minister who also hears again and so it seems does everybody in the nation. The nightmare is over, whether by the increased piety of the nation or just out of luck, but it is over. The nightingale sings again!"

They reek, a foul and poignant smell of salt fills the air on the beach, sometimes even terrorising the interior when the winds point west. People get sick and lethargic over the smell and it hampers with everyday life on the coast, on top of the pollution of the beaches and the dangers some extremely venomous jellyfishes like the Cobalt Dragon or the Feiten Great Junk pose to those that accidentally step on them.

It's still there, the spirits still walk upon the same earth as the Godlost and the masses slowly start doing various old traditions and rituals in the hopes to shield themselves from the spirits and the rending.

Looking for any sliver of information on The Spirits and their magical might and such rumors quickly spread to many people across and even beyond the country till one slow day, around a slow evening a scholar requested a meeting with the ruler, The soldiers delivered a simple message to him which says "I can teach you how to become as Great as the Spirits themselves"

But during one such festival, just as midnight rolled in, when people were dancing, giant dark shadows quickly followed up dancing with the people and even Harimari, their moves imitating their dances, and soon the dark shades were replaced with colors as the citizens continued with the ritual. Oni´s both Red and Blue, participating in this festival, also hoping that this might appease the spirits.

The heir´s eyes sharpen up before meeting with the governors and his son's eyes making some side remarks towards him. Even playing victim saying that the heir keeps giving them the "bad eye". The heir does not enjoy being lied to and he's gonna make sure that they don´t mess around with a little tea party…"
 spirits.233.d:0 "Such humiliating governor! Gonna make sure that he works twice as hard for that disaster and ruined my outfit!"
 spirits.234.t:0 "Should I stay or should I go?"
 spirits.234.d:0 "The Heir takes a deep breath of air after the months of his "resurrection" From a small hill overlooking the palace from a distance. A small stone grave looking upon the capital with him standing underneath a chrysanth tree. The scars are fully healed but he was not called back to the spirit realm. It only made him ponder what was the right course of action now? He had the full freedom to take over one his "father" passes on and all the bad apples have been taken care off in the course. He could simply leave a younger but promising cousin to become the heir and leave him some incredible teachings before returning to the spirit realm. On the other hand he could live on leaving a mark upon the world, maybe leave a better life for himself and the people of this nation? "
 spirits.234.a:0 "I will not make the same mistakes like in my past!" 
 spirits.234.b:0 "I leave the torch to the next in line"
 spirits.235.t:0 "Possessed Warriors"
 spirits.235.d:0 "My Monarch! The general's report of a strange event! As the army was training they said that a sudden formation of ghosts formed opposite of them and charged at the soldiers!. The soldiers act and speak differently with some long forgotten accents but still follow orders with no questions or remarks, though they seem to struggle somewhat with the fire weapons and guns but their skills with classic weapons, spears and swords are suddenly second to none! They say that the soldiers are possessed but otherwise there is no harm."
 spirits.235.a:0 "As long as they follow my  and my general's orders they may fight on!"
 spirits.236.t:0 "Not to my Standards"
 spirits.236.d:0 "My Lord! The soldiers report having problems with the officers! They say that they are possessed, forcing them to train and spar to impossible standards! There were already accidents and even lives lost as the officers force on their commands! Their training styles reminded some soldiers and court members of old records from Xia, such training practices were stopped for the sheer amount of strain it gives to the soldiers but those that go through them are quick developed and trained beyond any normal standard. What shall we do?"
 spirits.236.a:0 "We can't sadly exorcise them but we might as well try to learn a thing or two from the past"
 spirits.237.t:0 "Thy ancestors smile upon thee"
 spirits.237.d:0 "While the ruler was initiating the meeting with the local governors and nobility, suddenly above him and the rest of the courtroom, shapes and faces of the past ruler suddenly emerged. Some of the older members quickly gasped in panic at the sight of the deceased now watching over them and the theme quickly changed as they gestured to speak first. Speechless as the court was, the ruler nervously nodded, gesturing them to talk which turned the mood in the room from shock to a pleasant moment as not only they praised the ruler but also accepted the nobility's conduct. Overall it ended with a great note. The royal advisors could only bow to the blessed current ruler knowing the ancestors' blessing that he was going to lead them to a brighter future."
 spirits.237.a:0 "And I shall not disappoint!"
 spirits.238.t:0 "Thy ancestors are not satisfied"
 spirits.238.d:0 "While the ruler was initiating the meeting with the local governors and nobility, suddenly above him and the rest of the courtroom, shapes and faces of the past ruler suddenly emerged. Some of the older members quickly gasped in panic at the sight of the deceased now watching over them and the theme quickly changed as they gestured to speak first. As speechless as the court was, the ruler nervously nodded, gesturing them to talk which turned the mood in the room from shock to an unpleasant moment as the spirits of the past speak from one bad not to the other. Pretty much an hour passing by before the spirits spoke out their takes on the ruler before disappearing. That left a bad taste in the court who look like they lost some hope with how the nation might fare in the future"
 spirits.238.a:0 "I hope that I can prove them wrong in the future…"
 spirits.239.t:0 "Not yet done"
 spirits.239.d:0 "It was during one of the tea ceremonies with the local governors attending and discussing the local policies and how the real fares. A common event for the court tho during the meeting the ruler dropped his tea, staining his precious outfit. The servants quickly rush for the ruler, making sure that he is fine before he simply raises his hands and tells them to go back to their posts before he eyes the rest of the court. Everyone else is suddenly nervous at the tense and strict way the ruler spoke before requesting to repeat the state of the nation during the Times of Rending. What previously was an unsure tone on how to deal with the Rending and the Temple, now is a firm and confident tone as almost as he speaks with experience or knowledge about this. Whatever it may be he knows what he does"
 spirits.239.a:0 "There is no time to waste, bring me some paper, we got many project to finish!"
 spirits.240.t:0 "The Glowing Paths"
 spirits.240.d:0 "We got reports of unusual spirit sightings, to be more precise our scouts reported herds of spirit elephants walking day and night through the countryside. What we assumed first to be some ill omen or them potentially attacking our citizens quickly turned out that it was no such thing. The Spirits were traveling older paths forgotten through time and wars. Though they might be dirt paths they still give us a big tactical advantage incase we need to move our armies swiftly across the country"
 spirits.240.a:0 "We need to make sure to honor such gentle spirits for their gift."

In a mad rage, $MONARCH$ began attacking the nearest courtiers before they could realize what was going on.\n\nA wise old advisor yelled out that the $MONARCHTITLE$ had been possessed by a wrathful spirit. At that point, $MONARCH$ had already attacked and bloodied three courtiers, so those present had no choice but to subdue their $MONARCHTITLE$. In the struggle, $MONARCH$ sadly died. Their last words were curses and threats yelled in an ancient dialect.\n\nLater, out wisemen, philosophers and mages concluded that it must have been one of $MONARCH$’s ancestors who, for unknown reasons, must have held a bitter grudge even in death. A grudge that just so happened to rear its wrathful and hateful head today of all days."

Our court mages and revered priests have done everything in their power but have been unable to exorcise this malevolent spirit. $HEIR$ grows more violent and uncontrollable every day, and since we cannot be rid of this mad ancestor, we unfortunately have no choice but to put poor $HEIR$ out of $HEIR_ADJ$ misery."

 spirits.401.t:0 "Philosophers Demand Restoration"
 spirits.401.d:0 "The Temple Complex of [Root.GetName] has seen better days, and the Philosophers know it. Those in the province have demanded that the state fund the restoration of the Temples. This would be a huge drain on the treasury and our resources, for little immediate gain. But perhaps it might be worth it, if only to appease the Philosophers."
 spirits.401.a:0 "Very well"
 spirits.401.b:0 "They're only buildings..."
 spirits.402.t:0 "Riot at the Temples!"
 spirits.402.d:0 "It appears our continued neglect of the Temple Complex of [Root.GetName] has culminated into violence, as some firebrand Philosophers have incited a riot among the local High Philosophy faithful. They demand the state do something about the damage to the temple or there will be \"dire consequences\"."
 spirits.402.a:0 "Damn rabble-rousers!"
 spirits.402.b:0 "Send in the troops"
 spirits.403.t:0 "Temple Complex Neglected"
 spirits.403.d:0 "The Temple Complex of [Root.GetName]  has been in disrepair for some time now, and those who regularly visit it are requesting that the state do something about it. The restoration of the temple would require years of labor and funds that could be used elsewhere. On the other hand, doing so would get these people off our backs, and perhaps even bring in some revenue from those who wish to see its majesty."
 spirits.403.a:0 "Fund restoration efforts"
 spirits.403.b:0 "They're only buildings..."
 spirits.404.t:0 "Earthquake!"
 spirits.404.d:0 "An earthquake has struck the province of [Root.GetName], severely damaging its Temple Complex. Entire chambers have been destroyed, and it appears the entire complex itself is now at risk of collapsing. Temple keepers are requesting aid in looking for survivors and repairing damaged structures."
 spirits.404.a:0 "Fund immediate restoration efforts"
 spirits.404.b:0 "Send relief"
 spirits.404.c:0 "Damn"
 spirits.405.t:0 "Surge of Pilgrims"
 spirits.405.d:0 "In [Root.GetName], an unexpected influx of pilgrims has arrived earlier than usual this season, creating a clamour as they gather to pray and make offerings at the temples. Surprisingly, our infrastructure is already struggling to cope with the sheer number of visitors, and the pilgrimage season has not even officially started yet. The arrival of pilgrims not only brings increased footfall to the temples but also attracts merchants and encourages generous donations to the local religious establishments. However, what is perhaps most significant for us is the thriving economic activity resulting from the exchange of money during this pilgrimage.\n\nWith the pilgrimage season yet to reach its peak, we can anticipate a substantial and sustained boost to the local economy in the foreseeable future."
 spirits.405.a:0 "Silence is golden, piety is silver…"
 spirits.406.t:0 "Fantastic Festival"
 spirits.406.d:0 "The temple complex in [Root.GetName] is a sight to behold as priests of all cloth and colour launch into a celebration around the base of one of the High Temples. The festival has drawn people from all across the province and even some beyond as priests give alms to the poor, games are held, and laughter rings out in joyous jubilation. It is surely a sign of prosperity and plenty in [Root.GetName] under our rule."
 spirits.406.a:0 "Celebration time indeed."
 spirits.407.t:0 "Scholars Gather at Temple"
 spirits.407.d:0 "Throngs of men and women gather in [Root.GetName] as a great  debate has erupted. What started as an impromptu event between three scholars under the eaves of the High Temple in [Root.GetName] has grown into a conclave that is rapidly drawing independent scholars from across the region into a surprisingly productive debate that has seen several interesting lines of thought our magistrates, merchants, and tacticians may be able to make use of."
 spirits.407.a:0 "Take heed of our Magistrates"
 spirits.407.b:0 "Our merchants could use the aid."
 spirits.407.c:0 "There is always war to wage."
 spirits.408.t:0 "Loaded with Chi"
 spirits.408.d:0 "It happened during a routine patrol by the local temple guard, which are usually done by soldiers in pairs and are normally uneventful. Though it's not uncommon that soldiers are spooked or "See things'' as they do patrols,  happening mostly after the sun settles and the area is bathed in moonlight. That's when one curious soldier wandered off into the temple, claiming he saw some faint yellow glow or aura leading into the temple, only to fall unconscious and wake up again in an outer courtyard of the temple. What really happened he can't recall, no matter how hard he tries, and not even mages could help him recover his memory. He does however know that he ventured deep into the temple, through the impenetrable darkness of the temple's heart before it all turned black. And whatever happened there, it loaded his body with chi and opened his inner chi gates. Gaining not only strength but also a wealth of knowledge. We suggest that he is made into a wizard general as he can be a powerful and loyal officer to our realm and ruler"
 spirits.408.a:0 "Bless the Spirits!"
 spirits.409.t:0 "Quarrelling Sides"
 spirits.409.d:0 "It's not too uncommon that priests and preachers come from all across Haless towards the High temples, seeking knowledge, guidance or answers to their faith. But every so often some religious figures tend to spark a heated debate among the priests and worshippers around the temple complex and even across the whole province. In Fact some of the local populace called for the army to stop this nonsense as a few sides and event cults started to get physical upon each other! Such fights are easily stopped since thes Quarrelling Sides are rarely as armed as our soldiers but they remember the fights and insults for quite some time."
 spirits.409.a:0 "I hope a comet Enlightens them"
 spirits.410.t:0 "Ever Growing Attraction"
 spirits.410.d:0 "The high temples are a sight to behold, such massive intriguing and yet mysterious structures standing for gods know how long upon our lands. Ever so often attracts a surge of people to come and settle in such provinces. Sadly at the cost of the growth of surrounding provinces, nevertheless such growth will surely benefit us in the long term if not even attract people and potentially influential people to our court."
 spirits.410.a:0 "As long they pay their taxes it's fine"
 spirits.411.t:0 "Ever growing piety"
 spirits.411.d:0 "One of the unique things about the temples, besides their intimidating size and height, is their ability to invoke the spiritual side of people in the province of a high temple. Soldiers are known after guarding the High Temples for a decent amount of time or after their service time to lay down their arms and join the local priesthood in the temple. Mostly describe it as a religious call within themselves but many officers and court members suggest that the temples do influence the people in a way but don´t know why or how"
 spirits.411.a:0 "As long as only a few change their way it should be fine, No?"
 spirits.412.t:0 "Center of Faith, Center of Trade"
 spirits.412.d:0 "With the High Temple finally standing tall, restored to its previous previous radiating glory, like aeons before it started to attract the masses across of Haless, halessi, Harimari, even dwarves and kobolds flock towards the Temple Complex in search for inspiration and faith. Tho such large influx of visitors quickly brought the attention of the Merchant class and traders too as culture and religion are being exchanged and studied, along with that plenty of exotic trade goods as well, and so a mayor of [Root.GetName] came forth asking for the Ruler to invest some funds to the local province so they may set up a Trade Center in the province"
 spirits.412.a:0 "Seems like the Temples attract not just faith"
 spirits.413.t:0 "Desperate push"
 spirits.413.d:0 "Without a warning one starry night. The local Oni minority for unknown reasons stormed the temple complex. Overwhelming the local sentry before storming into the temple. Alarms were raised and the local militia quickly assembled and rushed into the temple which the Oni started to tear through the deep chambers of the temples, walls torn down, gates and doors smashed as if they were looking for something. Though what specifically they were looking for, we did not find out as the local militia heroically fought and slayed the huge demons as fast as they could to stop the desecration of the temple, which sadly was not enough. Through the ruins we did find some strange artifacts belonging to the Oni and some which did not…"
 spirits.413.a:0 "This gonna be expensive…"
 spirits.413.b:0 "But to push deeper?"
 spirits.414.t:0 "But to push deeper?"
 spirits.414.d:0 "As ordered, the local militia at the orders of our ruler, went deeper into the temple, after the path of destruction left by the demons. Which was easy to notice by the devastation they left behind though judging by the path they systematically plundered through the deep chambers of the Temple Complex. In fact at the very end of the trail we found a group of them, standing in a moderate sized room. All standing on their feet but with their eyes missing their pupils, nothing not even stabbing them caused a reaction, almost like they were unconscious or dead. The militia men moved them as quickly as possible out of the temple, trying to interrogate them later. As for the room where they stopped, its corners and walls were engravings and strange trinkets decorating the walls belonging to none of the religions or people that we know. What shall we do with them Sire?"
 spirits.414.a:0 "After so much damage we might as well sell them to restore the temple, hopefully…"
 spirits.415.t:0 "Sponsored treasure hunters?"
 spirits.415.d:0 "The High Temples, despite their age, are often big targets of adventurers to explore their interiors and find treasures and map out the endless amounts of rooms that they have. Even after so many centuries adventurers still find all kinds of artefacts and trinkets inside them or various and mysterious notes and writing on the wall or old parchments. Today my lord you received a message of a known adventurer band, requesting your permission and some investment to search through one of your High Temples my liege. Tho be aware, sometimes they may do more harm than good"
 spirits.415.a:0 "I´ll take my chances. Prepare the adventurers!"
 spirits.415.b:0 "I´d rather not risk them damaging the High Temples"
 spirits.416.t:0 "The Carvings of the Ancestors: The Monkey?"
 spirits.416.d:0 "High Temples generally abound with embellishments in the form of murals, each narrating its unique tale. While certain paintings find clear and easily interpretable explanations, others remain enigmatic, defying decipherment. Among these enigmatic artworks, one holds the centre stage in an impassioned discourse—what is the nature of this creature? The majority of onlookers and scholars perceive it as a simian entity, yet an assertive faction contends that it is, in fact, a Goblin. The debate has now escalated to a point where these groups have taken to labelling each other as "apelovers" and "Goblingrouppies". At this juncture, our sovereign's intervention is sought to adjudicate and ascertain the true subject of the depiction."
 spirits.416.a:0 "That is clearly a monkey"
 spirits.416.b:0 "A goblin most definitely"
 spirits.416.c:0 "It’s neither you buffoons, get your eyes checked!"
 spirits.417.t:0 "The Carvings of the Ancestors: The Moon"
 spirits.417.d:0 "An ordinarily unobtrusive wall within the High Temple of [Root.GetName] bears carvings that have endured the passage of epochs. During a visit to the High Temple, our esteemed ruler paused, contemplative. What could that semicircle symbolise? Is it an empty vessel, evoking hunger's grip? Does it encapsulate the Moon's sway over tides? Might it form part of a ritual, a vestige of a bygone custom enshrouded in the mists of antiquity? Or does it harbour an altogether distinct significance, a riddle yet unsolved? Its import cannot be denied! Casting a discerning gaze around, they sought the insights of a groundskeeper, an individual deeply attuned to the temple's essence. As the groundskeeper's gaze alights upon the carving, a moment of contemplative silence passes, and then, with a sudden burst of certainty, they exclaim:"
 spirits.417.a:0 "That’s a bowl, for fruit probably"
 spirits.417.b:0 "That’s the Moon, sometimes at least"

 spirits.418.d:0 "High Temples are typically sanctuaries subject to vigilant oversight by authorities; however, on occasion, unforeseen incidents transpire. A dispute between two merchants within the revered High Temple of [Root.GetName] escalated into a chaotic fight, involving into a clash of at least twenty individuals. Projectiles were hurled, heads bashed, and bodies smashed. While the prompt intervention of local guards ultimately quelled the brawl, tragically, two lives were lost and multiple participants sustained grave injuries. Compounding the distress is the lamentable fact that the temple itself incurred some measure of damage, fortunately not extensive enough to necessitate extensive restorative efforts."

 spirits.418.c:0 "Demand both parties to pay for the repairs."
 spirits.419.t:0 "Cult of the Evil Moon"
 spirits.419.d:0 "The High Temples are like a puzzle we can't solve. Even though we've been near them for ages, we still don't know why they were built or who specifically built them. We know that it was a precursor realm, but the reasons behind them remain a mystery. This mystery has led to some strange ideas over time, like the thought that ancient aliens made them or that they were built by a kingdom that got submerged. Even though these ideas might sound a bit crazy, they've attracted quite a few people. Unfortunately, another idea has caused trouble. A group, more like a cult, has taken control of the High Temple in [Root.GetName]. The cult claims to know the real purpose of the temples. They say the temples, especially their centre, are actually powerful weapons that can be used to destroy what they call the ultimate source of evil: the moon.It might sound really weird and hard to believe, but we need to act and get the temple back from them before they cause serious damage."
 spirits.419.a:0 "Crush those moonies!"
 spirits.420.t:0 "Cult of Sacred Love"
 spirits.420.d:0 "The true purpose of the temples remains a mystery to us. However, this hasn't prevented people from concocting peculiar theories. Whether it's suggestions of a hidden indoor pool that heals all ailments or assertions that it once served as a refuge for an ancient Chickendeity, each theory seems more outlandish than the last. \n\nRecently, a new theory has surfaced, involving a High Temple in [Root.GetName]. A group known as the "Freelovers'' has seized control of the temple, transforming it into an open-air brothel where all are encouraged to indulge in worldly desires, or so they profess. According to their belief, the High Temples were sacred places where the precursors engaged in almost ritualistic acts of love. And while their theory is undoubtedly absurd and probably won’t take hold, many are calling for the expulsion of these "Freelovers" from the temple before their actions tarnish the sanctity of the entire site."
 spirits.420.a:0 "Give the soldiers some gloves and expel them"
 spirits.421.t:0 "Plundering of the High Temple"
 spirits.421.d:0 "War means devastation and pillaging of holy sites, including the High Temples. And even their profound importance doesn't shield them from being ravaged in times of conflict. The High Temple located in [Root.GetName] fell victim to plundering, resulting in the loss of both ancient relics and more contemporary artefacts. Moreover, the structure itself sustained extensive damage from the ravages of fire. The timeline for reclaiming the province remains uncertain, yet it is evident that substantial repairs are imperative. Our informants embedded within the city report concerning findings: cracked walls, the burning of wooden elements within, and a shroud of soot covering the entire complex. While our aspiration is to regain authority over the structure, we cannot afford complacency until [spirit_temple_plunderer.GetName] takes responsibility and bears the cost of the repairs."

 spirits.426.d:0 "The Ruler, being on the throne for so long and always hears all kinds of stories or events happening around the High Temple Complexes decided to visit them, perhaps out of curiosity or perhaps out of an inner calling. And So with a small elite escort he makes way, guided by a high priest as he tours the ruler through it. Explaining to him what they know about it and the many theories and practices around the temple. Though as the guide continues diligently telling the stories the lord gets distracted, his pace slowing down as he and his guard follow the guide till at one point even the elite guard got distracted by the leading priest, leaving the lord to look what appears to be a faint yellowísh color in the air, like some steam leading him to one of the many side chambers, his ears deaf as he follows the faith yellow fog path towards an empty room only to be suddenly stricken by lightning! Or was it something else? Looking around and waking up from the trance he does not recall anything else, just a small and empty golden chamber. The guards soon after rush towards the Ruler and bring him out, to be taken care by trained doctors."

 spirits.427.t:0 "Spark of Wisdom afterall"
 spirits.427.d:0 "After a year of recovering the injury at the High Temple the doctors perform one last check for the Ruler. Making sure that his body is in perfect shape, along with an Acupuncture session. Hitting all chi points and making sure no bad chi is left in his body after the incident from the Temple, though as the final needle is put inside him he suddenly jolts on the table, almost as if he was hit by lightning his body shook! His fists clench and the doctors quickly remove the needles before The Ruler slowly gets up unhindered by any injury, in fact he never felt better before! The doctors are rather stunned how fast the Ruler moved as he tended to lag behind in movement. They ask him to lay down to check once more only to find out that nothing was wrong? While the doctors spoke and checked with each other the Ruler was already out on his throne, leading the nation anew into a better direction"
 spirits.427.a:0 "Well, at least I understand why I am not a powerful mage."
 spirits.428.t:0 "An audience for all"
 spirits.428.d:0 "No matter how powerful or knowledgeable someone is, everyone needs a moment to rest and gather their thoughts. Even our glorious Ruler needs a breather if not gather some inspiration. And so he settled for a hill top underneath a chrysanthe tree with a perfect view of the High Temple on the other side of the province. And with a simple bamboo flute he played. Soft tunes playing out his whole life up to this point, the harsh yought, the ever threatening coronation as the new ruler. All the decisions, be it good or bad that brought him to this point under this chrysanthe tree. At that moment only he could be heard, across the small valley, attracting citizens to check the source of the soothing sounds. Gathering people by the hundreds, even smaller spirits appeared around the Tree, everyone listening quietly to the story of his flute."
 spirits.428.a:0 "Once he was done he bows to the crowd and silently ventures back to his Palace"
 spirits.429.t:0 "Not just Adventurers"
 spirits.429.d:0 "My lord! We got a report of wild animals attacking The High Temples and the towns around it! We are not sure what happened but all kinds of creatures attacked, from wild dogs, to tigers, even an elephant herd have been seen trampling and attacking the buildings in the High Temple province! We are not sure what attracted them there but we must do something quickly!"
 spirits.429.a:0 "Dispatch the army!"
 spirits.430.t:0 "Wisdom of a merchant"
 spirits.430.d:0 "During one trip to the High Temples the ruler got approached by a merchant of renown. Asking him what's the difference between Faith and Trade? The obvious point was, one was a spiritual matter and the other one a material. "No! But also yes" was the merchant's reply "Both are in principle the same. Exchange one to gain something else, in this case we exchange our time and dedication into faith to get the blessings of Spirits, gods or even oneselves. Trade does that too, exchanging our time and dedication to gain goods, money and wealth. That does not mean that they have to be separate, no? In the end we merchants do also exchange our wealth and goods to enrich ourselves in faith and piety. But there are exceptions on both sides, no? If you are interested I like to discuss some more with you"

 spirits.801.d:0 "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have received an exponential amount of messages from our governors and officials regarding strange "incidents" in the High Temples in our country. And while issues or disturbances have occurred before, this is something different...Read this report from a local girl for example: \n\n"Filthy Hobgoblin, not again!" My friends gave me a wary look as the ball ominously descended the dark and claustrophobic spiral staircase. This was not our first time losing the ball inside the temple, but each time was a nerve-wracking ordeal with the chilling darkness below. Despite the trepidation, we ventured into the foreboding High Temple to reclaim our lost ball. Deep within the dimly lit hall, we finally spotted the ball and hastily turned to leave. But this time, something felt terribly amiss. An unsettling feeling crept up my spine, but before I could ponder it further, I rushed to catch up with my friends, climbing the stairs frantically.\n\nJust as I was about to escape the last of the shadows, a sharp pain shot through my ankle. I spun around in horror, only to catch a fleeting glimpse of a malevolent grin retreating into the darkness. My heart pounded in my chest, and a primal fear overcame me. I let out a blood-curdling scream and sprinted up the stairs, not daring to look back. My breath was ragged as I raced straight home.\n\nWhen I arrived, panting and terrified, my mother brushed off my claims, dismissing them as childish imagination. My father scoffed, attributing the scratch to a stray animal. But my grandmother, her eyes hollow and distant, whispered with an eerie certainty, "They are coming, and our time is running out." And while my grandmother has always been a bit scary, there was something really wrong about how she said it…"

 spirits.830.d:0 "All Spirits bear some resentment towards the world, but none as much as Hokuma. For centuries, he was imprisoned and kept weak by the monstrous Oni’s of the Left Hand Path. Relentlessly drained of his powers by the Ogres for their malevolent, dark intentions, he knows no respite, no peace—only bitterness and rage. After centuries of captivity, the time for revenge has come, a moment to forever rid the sickly infection of the Left Hand Path and the Onis. Only then can Hokuma finally find solace./n/nHokuma's appearance is that of a black mist, so deep and dark that no mage or artist has been able to replicate it. Within this mist lies Hokuma's strength, and above all, his rage—rage towards the Onis who have exploited him for ages, milking him for magic and power. But not only is he a spirit of anger, he is a spirit of the earth as well and cares deeply for its wellbeing./n/nIn truth, Hokuma desires only one thing: tranquillity and peace in his hilly domain. He first and foremost wishes to purge the Demonhills of the Ogres. Additionally, Hokuma aims to vacate the Jademines of Goblins and Hobgoblins, for as an earth spirit, he despises the constant digging beside and underneath his domain."

In the Era of Many Kingdoms, Yanhe held the status of absolute authority. Each dynasty claimed descent from this revered dragon spirit, striving to mirror its dominance through displays of unwavering and ruthless rule./n/nYanhe appears as a colossal spectral rendition of the mythical Yanshen dragon. In truth, all dragons are modelled after Yanhe himself. Beyond embodying absolute power and control, Yanhe also represents an insatiable hunger for power, an ambition akin to Camiran, and the ability to maintain dominion through sheer ruthlessness./n/nNo longer constrained by the High Temples, Yanhe now harbours grand ambitions to reclaim his role as the wellspring of power in Yanshen. His demands include tribute, submission, and a return to absolutist governance above all else. Additionally, he seeks the purification of his realm from those who oppose either him or absolute rule itself. While many aspire to rule the world, Yanhe desires it the most."

 spirits.832.d:0 "The sun breaks over the Kharunyana and a pearlescent rainbow erupts through the river, as its guardian stretches his glistening splendour from bank to bank. While the first rumbling of the ground and roiling of the water brought terror to the folk of the river, the drenched and starry-eyed denizens now rush to the banks to seek out Kharyunyana, bearing banners and all the trappings of festivities as their beloved guardian returns. The protestations of the Philosophers mean nothing to the people, as the great catfish serves them a feast of his children, and all the fruits of the river upon their tables as the meek and mighty of the river flop up into boats to flee his terrific approach./n/nAppearing as a great catfish clad in white scales and an unfathomable length beyond that of the prow and bow of Rahen’s greatest warships, Kharunyana is as splendorous as the river it embodies and inhabits. It symbolises the wealth of the eponymous Kharunyana, the trade thereon and the development of nations on its banks. Those who follow Kharunyana can expect to receive wealth beyond their imagination and desire./n/nKharunyana wants nothing more than to once again swim the rivers unchecked and return its once unfathomable wealth back to the denizens of its rich merchant cities. But to do this would require drowning out the High Philosophies stranglehold over the region and river."
 spirits.832.a:0 "The tide of spirits will bring glory to the Kharunyana!"
 spirits.833.t:0 "Phokhao, Proud Peacock of the Phokhao"
 spirits.833.d:0 "In Haless, there's a saying that goes: 'proud as a peacock.' It's not hard to understand why, just by looking at a peacock - its enormous feathers spread out with magnificent colours and patterns, truly something to take pride in. And Phokhao is the proudest and most magnificent peacock and spirit that exists. His feathers are not only the largest, but also the most colourful, adorned with gemstones more splendid than those of the wealthiest merchants and the mightiest kings. Residing in the Phokhao mountain range, far above both human and beast, Phokhao embodies splendour and grandeur, vanity and artistry, while simultaneously embodying generosity, nobility, and benevolence. These traits are not contradictory for Phokhao; instead, they enhance one another. Phokhao's demands and desires are unique, expensive, but above all, noble - something to take pride in. The peacock spirit aspires to envelop the Phokhao in opulence and riches, and as a noble creature, to aid anyone in need of assistance."
 spirits.833.a:0 "Let us find and provide aid to the proudest peacock of the Phokhao"
 spirits.834.t:0 "Hengdu Bowu, Frog of Serene Winter"
 spirits.834.d:0 "The seasons of Haless represent one of life's few certainties for humans, harimari, or otherwise. Spring ushers in new life and a symphony of novel sounds. Summer brings warmth and the harvest, yet it also brings thunderstorms that shake the heavens. Autumn adorns the world with a tapestry of colours and fragrances, carried by harsh and loud winds. Winter, however, lays forth a satin shroud of coolness and currents of peace and serenity. It is within this very serenity that Hengdu Bowu takes form – the embodiment of winter's spirit, self improvement, and the harmonious unity of body and mind./n/nHengdu Bowu's initial manifestation arrives through snow and chill, transforming the entire province into a winter tableau in anticipation of its presence. Hengdu itself appears akin to a colossal spectral and blue frog, perfectly attuned to its own essence. This harmony of body and spirit inspires Xianjie's warriors to retreat into seclusion amid the winter landscape, seeking the tranquillity that cultivates both mind and body's perfection./n/nHengdu Bowu harbours no ambitions of conquest, yet he does demand the safeguarding of his domain against any threat to the spirits and peace. To preserve the peace and harmony between body and spirit, his dominion must persist as a realm of tranquillity, cooled and shielded."

 spirits.835.d:0 "In times immemorial, there existed a fisherman who, amidst a tempest, lost his ship and nearly his life to the tumultuous waves. He washed ashore onto the back of the whale spirit Cinulau, upon which a lush forest had taken root. The fisherman, determined to survive, aided Cinulau by removing barnacles, fending off sharks, and tending to the vegetation on Cinulau's back. In return, Cinulau set course towards the mainland, allowing the fisherman to journey homeward. After this encounter, Cinulau pledged to assist honourable and brave sailors who respect the sea, its inhabitants and its magnificent power. This commitment has earned Cinulau a revered role as the protector of the sea and those who navigate its depth./n/nCinulau takes the form of a majestic whale. The term "colossal" fails to capture the true expanse of this spirit, for it spans the size of an entire island and seamlessly blends among the myriad isles of the Ringlet Isles. This gentle giant of the seas assumes the role of protector, guarding the sea, its inhabitants, and the courageous, noble sailors./n/nTo Cinulau, the sea isn't merely a barrier dividing continents; it's a liquid highway, and it truly desires for both the Mystic Accord and Halessi maritime tradition to spread across the entirety of Halann. Those who claim authority over the sea act as Cinulau's stewards, a reality that sailors and rulers are wise to acknowledge.."

 spirits.836.d:0 "The Lupulan is the most popular spirit among the Mystic Accord, due to the Lupulan Rainforest being the last major stronghold of the faith. The Lupulan is the spirit who gives Yanglam kings their right to rule their lands and wage wars, and has thousands of small temples dedicated to it./n/nIt takes the shape of a massive monitor lizard who stalks the deep jungles, and whose sightings have been scarce since the formation of Arawkelin and the revival of the temples. They are also the jailer and guardian of Semat Tiditkuhai; the wretched and destructive spirit who cannot, in any case, be released upon the world for she would destroy it. But the Lupulan has always had a more important and positive role in Lupulan society. In times of yore, the sight of Lupulan was an omen of good fortune and prosperity and the Lupulan symbolises the safeguarding of nature and the harmonious order between humankind and the natural world./n/nAnd that is precisely the order that he desires to restore within his domain. An order that rekindles natural harmony and spiritual vigour to Southern Haless. Let the kings and rulers of Haless demonstrate their worthiness of blessing and approval, reigning with a mandate from the Lupulan!"

 spirits.837.d:0 "Quick-witted, agile, and, if one must muster the hubris to say it, foolhardy, the impish charm of Rahen’s keeper can hardly be resisted. Credited with many of the innovations that have sprouted from and reached the region, it's nearly impossible to separate the truth of Dhenbasana from the innumerable, outrageous stories of his debauchery. At this point, a long nose is said to be a sign of his favor, taken to mean one has inherited their patriarch’s guile, from one of his many trunk-in-hand trysts with the lovely men and ladies of his domain. Though the truth or feasibility of this is debatable, brilliant advisors appear and vanish on a whim in the courts of Rahen, leaving trails of innovation and scandal in equal measure in their wake. While one can talk all they want of their wisdom and restraint… that sly grin will win out in the end./n/nThe spectacle known as Dhenbasana doesn't cease with his actions. Emerging like a grand yet agile and athletic elephant, Dhenbasana is a charmer of prime allure. His arms and body adorned with the most exquisite jewellery, his trunk embellished with the finest tattoos, and his laughter, unadorned, stands as the world's most exquisite and irresistible. When Dhenbasana graces the court with his presence, a magnificent celebration and spectacle inevitably unfolds, sparing no expenses or efforts. Dhenbasana embodies intellect over strength, hedonism over piety, and even intrigues over sincerity and corruption over honour, because according to Dhenbasana, a sealed, candid, and uncomplicated life is simply tedious, boring and monotonous./n/nDhenbasana's true desire from us is rather simple: a state that personifies hedonism. Away with the rigid and pious followers of High Philosophy, it's time for Rahen to bask in a golden era of pleasure! By gathering the greatest intellects, the most agile acrobats, the finest dwarf brewers, and the most sought-after courtesans, we can transform our court into a hub of delight, debauchery and Dhenbasanic pleasure!"

 spirits.838.d:0 "It has long been a tradition for the kings of the arid north to venture out into the dust and sand, to find their strength, and prove worthy of their crown… Hardly a soul could say why, until the temples waned. The sands surged forth, scouring the flesh of the craven and cruel, a lion’s roar echoing across the dust-veiled heavens as tyrants were ripped from their thrones. Those few who have reached the eye of the storm can attest to his true manifestation. A writhing cloud coalescing at a single point, a visage rippling between the menacing maw of a regal lion, and the wise gaze of a monarch just as magnificent. Only a princeling’s heart can say if they will return from the storm bearing a swirling crown of sand and dust, or if their pale, sand-scoured bones will lie beneath the desert forevermore./n/nMarutha, a noble and regal beast, exudes a simplicity in its appearance, mirroring the inherent majesty of a lion, the paragon of regality itself. Its image adorns countless heraldries and banners, emanating royal power and honour unparalleled by any other creature. With a crown of golden hair and a stature befitting a monarch beyond compare, Marutha embodies the essence of nobility and royal grandeur. A ruler who aligns themselves with Marutha exudes unmatched potency, strength, and magnificence./n/nA noble and splendid court is what Marutha deems as the hallmark of a court that is befitting of his approval. And so, this is the mission bestowed upon us by the mighty spirit lion. And our task is not only to prove to ourselves and Marutha the grandeur of our court, but to showcase it to the entire world!"

 spirits.839.d:0 "Lost in dreams, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wandered through a fatally dry desert for weeks, with neither sustenance nor succour. As their dream-self began to finally collapse from thirst, they collapsed beneath a dry, shadeless tree, its branches clutching like gnarled hands towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s painfully slow death. From the stones before their eyes emerged a scorpion, a small creature with a bulbous tail swaying under its own weight. It crept across the broken earth, crawling onto the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s hand. There, it paused for a moment, staring with its many implacable eyes, stinger hanging over bare skin. Is this a sign? Is the scorpion a symbol and the desert an allegory of sorts? Waking up from the dream our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows it to be true: it is a message of the great spirit of the sands, the king of scorpions, dominion lord of the Naymak Kuwatai, Gehet Ketine./n/nThe kingscorpion, Gehet Ketine shows itself as a larger than life desert scorpion but with some "differences' '. As while Gehet has a potent poison, their pincers aren’t smaller or less sharp because of this. Despite its imposing stature, the scorpion adeptly conceals itself within the shifting sands and dark shadows. Gehet Ketine embodies the essence of espionage, intrigue, and covert operations, its affinity for obscurity allowing it to embody the role of an assassin. With unparalleled finesse, Gehet operates from the concealment of darkness, its marks falling before they even notice, a testament to its mastery in the art of stealth./n/nThe desert scorpion yearns for the arid expanse to reclaim its status as a haven for nomads and enigmatic assassins. No longer shall it tolerate the dominance of deceitful creeds or those who seek to malign and subjugate the spirits that dwell within. It is our sacred duty to fulfil this mission for Gehet Ketine. From the darkness of the shadows, we shall strike, swift as the desert tempests, and unrelenting as the scorpion's sting."

 spirits.840.d:0 "United like twin rivers, yet separated by the land between them, the river siblings Hukai and Telebei form a symbiosis within Bomdan, bridging the north and south, the rivers that bear their names, and the cities that grace their shores. In their respective territories, these two spirits are viewed as auspicious omens. When a swan herder welcomes new cygnets, it is tradition to invoke the name of the darker Hukai as a tribute to the river. And when a turtle traverses a path along the Telebei, it is deemed an obligation for people to either allow the creature safe passage or aid it in crossing, safeguarding it from harm./n/nThough dissimilar in appearance, the twin sisters are bound by an unbreakable connection. One is a magnificent black Halless swan, while the other is a steadfast freshwater turtle. This bond symbolises the deep unity among the peoples of these two rivers—forever intertwined in art, craftsmanship, and culture, much like the inseparable twins themselves./n/nHukai and Telebei yearn for a resurgence of the arts and crafts within their domains. A time where craftsmanship and the arts reclaim their honourable positions, surpassing fleeting trends from distant lands. It rests upon us to reunite the swan and the turtle once more, nurturing the flourishing of the arts. While the glory of war may be transient, the essence of art endures eternally."

 spirits.841.d:0 "Long ago, the Vulpine Lady of Yinquan, the queen of spirits, met her demise, not through murder, but through being fragmented into hundreds of fox spirits, a result of the machinations of the Precursors. As she passed, her devoted followers made a singular promise: that she would one day be reborn and subsequently return to her rightful place, and that day has arrived.Upon her resurrection, the Vulpine Lady will take the form of a fox with nine hundred and ninety-nine tails, symbolising the ambiguity between good and evil, the vast realm of moral greyness, and the allure of magic and the arcane. Just as her tails number a thousand, so do choices and interpretations of which none are true good or evil/n/nIf we want to succeed in resurrecting the Vulpine Lady, it will be paramount to ready ourselves for a new era, one where Huszien reigns over both spirits and humans. And so it falls upon us to make the necessary preparations for the resurrection ritual. Let the grand fox spirit rise from the realm of the departed and onto her rightful throne!"

 spirits.842.d:0 "The all-seeing eye of Tughayasa stands as a unique spirit, distinct from all others. While some possess vast powers that rend the earth or ensnare the acts of debauchery, Tughayasa simply observes, seeing it all. This great Oracle spirit peers into the future and the past, casting its gaze upon lands both near and far. It perceives the seen and the unseen, culminating as the very essence that bestows its name and symbol upon the Oracle of Tughayasa./n/nThis sublime Oracle spirit assumes the form of eyes, floating like paper talismans. When blinking it sounds like the shredding of paper and hovers above the world, ever-watchful and contemplative. It epitomises foresight, divination, and the profound philosophical insights and wisdom of the Oracle Order./n/nTo garner its favour, we embark upon the sacred task of looking into the future, refining the Oracle of Tughayasa to greater heights and stature, and demonstrating to the spirit of unparalleled clarity our worthiness of its gift—the unbroken vision over all the entire expanse of Halann in past, present and future. Let us reveal our merit, inviting all to be seen through the discerning eyes of Tughayasa!"

 #Temple Quest Encounter descriptions TODO: Can rewrite or just fluff them up - up to a paragraph or two at max, basically describing a fight with golems or a trap encounter with associated outcomes of either coming out fine or getting 1 party member wounded/killed - could whip up a custom loca string to reference the party leader (the Storied Bard/Veteran Fighter etc) if desired. Every killed string should end with "a party member was §Rwounded§!/§Rkilled§!" or a variation of that, as a Necromancer might raise them, adding " Fortunately for them, they were §RRaised§! from death by the Necromancer." at the end of the description string

One member decided it was smart to dip their toe in it. They now lack a toe and are §Rwounded§!, as it was acid."
 trap_wounded_key_desc12:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across an oddly featureless hallway. One member cautiously decided to scout ahead, but unfortunately triggered a hidden blade trap coming from the wall. The tip of their nose was cut off and they are now §Rwounded§!."
 trap_wounded_key_desc13:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party passed by a dark room with what seemed like a little girl inside, whispering a nursery rhyme. Someone thought it would be funny to tell it to "Shut up". In response, the mouth of the "girl" opened and the party member in question was knocked down and §Rwounded§! by a concussion spell that could have killed them if they had been any closer."
 trap_wounded_key_desc14:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nOne of our members was scouting ahead and walked into a room with many statues. The statues each had open mouths at around eye level. Upon walking past the statues, one fired an arrow at them, and now they are §Rwounded§! with an arrow stuck in their cheek."
 trap_wounded_key_desc15:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across a room with three different exits, each with writing above their entrances. Our translator claims to have an extensive knowledge of folklore, but they weren’t confident they could solve the riddle behind this room. Knowing they might be wrong, the translator volunteered to go first, and almost slipped into a pit with spikes. They were slightly §Rwounded§! from falling, but luckily only sustained minor injuries."
 trap_wounded_key_desc16:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe found a rickety rope bridge over a dark, seemingly bottomless chasm. The party decided to go one by one, very slowly, but one of the party members was still §Rwounded§! from a muscle rupture anyway when they fell through a broken plank."
 trap_wounded_key_desc17:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe discovered a room filled with little statues made of gemstones, gold and even damestear. Despite promising to ignore them, one of our members wasn’t able to control their curiosity and greed, and tried to take a gold statue. It turns out they were extremely hot, and they were §Rwounded§! by a nasty burn."
 trap_wounded_key_desc18:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe happened upon a large door with the inscription "Treasure Room" written above it. Most of the group decided to ignore this obvious trap, but one member couldn’t help themselves and peeked inside. They were subsequently clawed in the face by a feral beast, leaving them §Rwounded§!."
 trap_killed_key_desc1:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nOne of the party members clumsily hit a tripwire. It didn’t activate a trap, but they landed straight on their head, and died by §Rcracking their skull§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc2:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWithout thinking, a party member decided to touch an odd-looking relic, as there were no obvious traps in the room. Moments later, they were §Rincinerated§! by a magical trap."
 trap_killed_key_desc3:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nOne of our members ran ahead of the group to loot the next room. A moment later, they vanished after falling through the solid floor. It turns out it was an illusionary floor, and they §Rfell into a pit of spikes§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc4:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe encountered a room with lots of blood and crushed bones on the floor. One member decided to get a closer look at one of the skeletons, causing the roof come down, §Rcrushing their head into a fine red paste§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc5:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a chamber where we found a large imposing statue pointing towards one of the rooms adjacent to us. Thinking it led to a treasure room, one of the party members decided to run in to take all the loot for themselves, and was §Rkilled by a hail of arrows§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc6:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe encountered a room that had a tile-patterned floor. Thinking the designs were just for decoration, one of the party members began to walk across, broke through the floor, and §Rfell into a dark abyss§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc7:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party encountered a large room with some strange wind streams flowing across it from two different directions. While we attempted to avoid contact with them, one of the party members went into a stream accidentally and got §Rpierced in the head by an arrow§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc8:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large corridor with multiple rooms along both sides. The rooms seemed to contain horrifying statues of demons, monsters, and evil spirits. One of the party members went to investigate one of the statues, went mad within seconds, and §Rslit their own throat to escape the agony§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc9:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party decided to camp in a large room with a small hole in the roof. During the night, the group was woken up suddenly by the screams of a party member who was being bitten by dozens of snakes. While the rest of us were able to get away safely, the one on watch §Rsuccumbed to the bites of dozens of angry snakes§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc10:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe happened along a long hallway that was overrun with vines. One of the party members decided to try to hack through them with a machete, releasing a lethal cloud of gas. Seconds later, they §Rdied to poison§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc11:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party entered a large room with a pool of what seemed like fresh water. One of the party members decided to go for a swim, and was §Rdissolved into nothingness by acid§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc12:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across a featureless hallway. One of our members didn’t think twice about the lack of traps, and decided to walk ahead of the group. Moments later, they were §Rsliced in two§! by a large blade coming out from the wall!"
 trap_killed_key_desc13:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party passed by a dark room with what seemed like a little girl inside, whispering a nursery rhyme. Trying to help, one of the party members approached it when the mouth of the "girl" opened and the party member was §Rblown into the wall by a concussion spell§!, dying instantly on impact!"
 trap_killed_key_desc14:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nThe party found a room of statues with open mouths at eye height. One of us decided to peer into one of the mouths, hoping for some loot, but all they found was §Ran arrow impaling their head§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc15:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe came across a room with three different exits, each with writing above their entrances. Our translator read the writing aloud, and one party member claimed it was a riddle, and they knew the answer. They walked confidently through one of the doorways, and proceeded to §Rfall into a pit of spikes§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc16:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe found a rickety rope bridge over a seemingly bottomless chasm. The party decided to go one by one, but the last member to cross broke through a rotten wood plank, and §Rfell into the deep and misty abyss§!!"
 trap_killed_key_desc17:0 "[GetMonthName] [GetYear] Expedition of the [temple_quest_target.GetName] Temple Complex\n\nWe discovered a room filled with little statues made of gemstones, gold and even damestear. Despite promising to ignore them, one of our members gave in to their greed, and pocketed a damestear statue. Upon taking it off its pedestal, they activated a trapdoor, and §Rfell into a  deep shaft with magma at the bottom§!!"
