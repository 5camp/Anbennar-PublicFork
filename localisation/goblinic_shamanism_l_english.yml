 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.2.d:0 "Of the many peoples we allied or subjegated one follows a faith from the West which believes the gods don't interfere directly in the mortal plane, but instead use 'avatars' to execute their will in the world. Despite these people clearly not understanding theology (as everyone can see their 'dame' and 'Castellos' are but aspects of our moongoddes), some of our people have begon to take over this idea."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.2.a:0 "Well, that would explain why nobody sees the gods."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.3.t:0 "The importance of the thought"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.3.d:0 "We recently heard of a philoposophy, originally invented by Gnomes, which claims to be above theology and to be compitable with all beliefs in gods. Its followers say it is the best way to reach enlightnment."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.20.d:0 "We currently find ourselves forging ties with a realm still venerating the oldest of all gods: Grandmother Earth, the first being who stepped out of the primordial chaos and mother of uncountable gods. She is so old she has more names (ranging from Teerdi to Soilide) then any other deity.\nMillenia ago our people were thrown out of their original underground homes and dismissed her as but a minor god as she failed to help them, but perhaps our ancestors should have given her a second chance, as they did for their later gods."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.20.a:0 "Maybe it's time our religion returns to its roots."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.21.t:0 "Kroozbuto Nubo"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.21.d:0 "Recently some of our people have come back from listening to the herdsmen of a nearby country: they now say we don't give enough veneration to the lord of the sky. According to the herdsmen they visited he's one of the most important spirits being the father of all stars, the maker of clouds, the bringer of rain and the ruler of the Milkyway."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.21.a:0 "The father of all stars, that's a lot of children!"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.22.t:0 "Tewaka Sunka"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.22.d:0 "Today we were visited by traders from one of our neighbouring countries. They claim that their nation considers to sun to be the most powerfull and clever of all gods, despite being imprisoned by her sister. They claim the many contradictions in our mythologies are caused by her plots, which can span centuries, and that someday she'll succeed in breaking free and take back her rightfull place as ruler of all stars begining an age which shall be named after the metal of the sun, gold.\nShe previously already helped the mortals by spreading the arts of medicine and shamanism and now is using her schemes to prepare the conquest of Earth by our kind."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.24.d:0 "Even a goblin child knows Gaurd Thunder, whether no matter whether he is known as Blexim or Eragurd in our realm: He's the morning star who circles the sun in order to fight against the hordes of evil spirits, who want to kidnap her, with his lighning arrows.\nHowever some know him as much more: according to traveling fanatics he once liberated the other gods known by our people from slavery by the evil deity followed by the brutish orcs, 'Great Dookan', when Dookan was distracted fighting other gods.\nNow he's fighting both Dookan and the other gods alien to our kind, and he's calling on his followers to help him by fighting their henchmen on Earth."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.24.a:0 "Wait, he claims our gods once were enslaved by Dookan? That's heresy!"

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.28.d:0 "There have always have been a few outcasts in goblin society who worship 'controversial' gods, however amongst the privateers employed by our government this is becoming commonplace: They have started to follow the rogue star, the pirate under the gods, 'Lord Water' himself. Whilst they justify this by claiming he commited great services to the world in his fights against sea monster, this nonetheless disturbs the more conservative of our population."
