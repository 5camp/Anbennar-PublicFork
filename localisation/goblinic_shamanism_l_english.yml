 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.2.d:0 "Of the many peoples we allied or subjugated one follows a faith from the West which believes the gods don't interfere directly in the mortal plane, but instead use 'avatars' to execute their will in the world. Despite these people clearly not understanding theology (as everyone can see their 'Dame' and 'Castellos' are but aspects of our moon-goddess), some of our people have begun to take over this idea."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.2.a:0 "Well, that would explain why nobody sees the gods."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.3.d:0 "The gnomes value intelligence over all else. They pay homage to neither gods nor spirits, preferring to develop an understanding of the physical world. A group of our shamans have donned gnomish thinking caps and now demand recognition as the Cult of Reason. They have begun debating, experimenting and recording every major and minor discovery they have made. While they are eccentric even by goblin standards and the majority of their findings have been useless at best, occasionally they produce actionable ideas."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.4.d:0 "The dwarves we have conquered seem to possess a strange way of venerating their ancestors.

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.20.d:0 "We currently find ourselves forging ties with a realm still venerating the oldest of all gods: Grandmother Earth, the first being who stepped out of the primordial chaos and mother of uncountable gods. She is so old she has more names (ranging from Teerdi to Soilide) then any other deity.\n\nMillennia ago our people were thrown out of their original underground homes and dismissed her as but a minor god as she failed to help them, but perhaps our ancestors should have given her a second chance, as they did for their later gods."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.21.d:0 "Recently some of our people have come back from listening to the herdsmen of a nearby country: they now say we don't give enough veneration to the lord of the sky. According to the herdsmen they visited he's one of the most important spirits being the father of all stars, the maker of clouds, the bringer of rain and the ruler of the Milkyway."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.21.a:0 "The father of all stars, that's a lot of children!"

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.22.d:0 "Today we were visited by traders from one of our neighbouring countries. They claim that their nation considers to sun to be the most powerful and clever of all gods, despite being imprisoned by her sister. They claim the many contradictions in our mythologies are caused by her plots, which can span centuries, and that someday she'll succeed in breaking free and take back her rightful place as ruler of all stars beginning an age which shall be named after the metal of the sun, gold.\n\nShe previously already helped the mortals by spreading the arts of medicine and shamanism and now is using her schemes to prepare the conquest of Earth by our kind."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.23.t:0 "Muta Mestika"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.23.d:0 "Our shamans tell us of an old goddess, who is newly demanding of attention. Mother Moon: The goddess of justice and rulership. According to the exodus goblins she became the current head of the pantheon, after overthrowing her older sister and forcing her to become the sun by chaining her to a flying chariot. It is said she only speaks in puns and double entendres, regarded by learned shamans as the highest form of poetry."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.24.d:0 "Even a goblin child knows Guard Thunder, whether no matter whether he is known as Blexim or Eragurd in our realm: He's the morning star who circles the sun in order to fight against the hordes of evil spirits, who want to kidnap her, with his lighning arrows.\n\nHowever some know him as much more: according to traveling fanatics he once liberated the other gods known by our people from slavery by the evil deity followed by the brutish orcs, 'Great Dookan', when Dookan was distracted fighting other gods.\n\nNow he's fighting both Dookan and the other gods alien to our kind, and he's calling on his followers to help him by fighting their henchmen on Earth."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.24.a:0 "Wait, he claims our gods once were enslaved by Dookan? That's heresy!"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.25.t:0 "Vortza Lesa"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.25.d:0 "A shaman has returned from a quest into the woods with a profound appreciation of Vortza Lesa, Lady Forest, and would demand we all pay her equal respect. She is mainly seen as a mediator between goblinkind and all the forest spirits, but the forest goblins in the Deepwoods go much further and see her as the personification of all nature and thus the only deity worthy of worship"

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.26.t:0 "Vortzo Laukuno"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.26.d:0 "A farmer tending the field had a vision, and has been welcomed by the shamans as one of them given the profundity of her vision. She brings with her teachings of Vortzo Laukuno, Lord Agriculture: He isn't normally regarded as an important god, however an exception are the Exodus Goblins with whom he has highly risen in rank after having conquered a fertile agricultural region as homeland. Thanks to a deal between the gods he has to spend a third of the year in the underworld, so he can only spend the rest of the year with his wife the forest goddess, above ground. The time spends in the underworld is generally referred to as 'winter'."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.27.t:0 "Vortza Krpa"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.27.d:0 "A weaver fell into a trance while at a loom, and when he emerged, he had created an incredible picture of Vortz Krpa, Lady Cloth. This omen certainly means we will have to pay her respect in the future. She is, after all, the goddess of weaving, trade and many other crafts. As the daughter of Strahllena and Blexim, she was raised by the other gods who tossed her around like a hot potato. However this allowed her to learn many trades. She ended up marrying Wezariff for business reasons. (i.e. in exchange for him stopping to constantly rob her.)"

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.28.t:0 "Zvaiko Udenzo"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.28.d:0 "There have always have been a few outcasts in goblin society who worship 'controversial' gods, however amongst the privateers employed by our government this is becoming commonplace: They have started to follow the rogue star, the pirate under the gods, 'Lord Water' himself. Whilst they justify this by claiming he committed great services to the world in his fights against sea monster, this nonetheless disturbs the more conservative of our population."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.28.a:0 "Fascinating..."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.29.t:0 "Zvaika Kirba"
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.29.d:0 "A half-drowned goblin, after the water was pumped from her lungs, has shared with our shamans the conversation she had while drowning with the god Star Water. A rogue star, when the other gods were busy fighting each other, he carved out his own domain in the seas, he ended up wounded in the fighting and now wears an eye patch and wooden leg. He acts as the protector of pirates and fishers. It is also believed he causes floods when he's drunk, so it is forbidden to sacrifice alcohol to him."
 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.29.a:0 "We shall not sacrifice alcohol, and instead will drink it all!"

The only survivor is a small child, whose eyes have been seared red, and speaks only of Vortzo Liezmo, Lord Fire. As the god of fire, furnaces and industry, he is the protector of smiths and also the miners who supply them with material. It is said managed to trick Kroozmuta Zemna into allowing the those who plundered the Earth, her realm, into the good parts of the afterlife. He is therefore highly regarded by the miners among the cave goblins."

But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has a much better idea that listening to their advisors' disparate voices — why not reach out to the clan's founders, to be certain we are following in their footsteps?

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.50.d:0 "Your country is at war, and to a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], war is a family business. Your son, [Root.Heir.GetName] has been appointed general and will lead the [Root.GetAdjective] armies to victory. Your daughter has also taken a keen interest in the war, studying warfare alongside her religious education.\n\nOne night, the courts storyteller retells the story of how Muta Mestika once led the divine army against the demons. Your daughter listens, transfixed. When she later approaches you, you already know her request."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavor.51.d:0 "Maintaining marriage bonds with other countries has helped [Root.GetName] diplomatically and in a recent meeting with the ruler of such an ally, you also discussed the spiritual significance of the bonds of marriage.\n\nThe ruler and many ambassadors were followers of Vortza Lesa, and knew our god as Vortza Lesa's consort Vortzo Laukuno. You took this opportunity to speak to them about the importance of our god as a medium to the divine and the bringer of prosperity.

Our feral kinsmen followed their commands and cries with a fervor unnatural to goblins, riding forward on spiders fuelled by the promise of a glorious afterlife. The ensuing battle leveled the town, and had left hundreds dead, along with their leader.\n\nThough dead, they remain immortal, with war-dogs and spider jockeys charging in their name before crashing into glorious combat, fighting to enter that same glorious afterlife that they and their shamans--the survivors of that great battle--wished to enter."

 goblinic_shamanism_flavour.413.d:0 "To the goblins, the kobolds were an interesting people. Like them they stood in a hostile land surrounding by invaders come to retake their land, but unlike them they were driven by a strong religious and social urge that united them all, HOARDING. This concept of an eternal greed for riches was quite familiar to goblins, but the display of it in massive piles was entirely new… and enticing. If goblinkind was to borrow this idea however they were going to do it their way, not through private hoards within their homes but through massive displays available for all to see. The shamans would accept the "donations" and in turn keep a running tally of everyone’s hoards and guarantee bragging rights to any goblin that wishes to flaunt his wealth."
