 rinta_seeker_events.60.t:0 "Conflict On The Streets"
 rinta_seeker_events.60.desc:0 "In a country where Mwalim and Darwiiz are supposed to be in tandem, it is only natural that many of their opposing ideals would come into conflict. An undignified episode has made this clear in recent days, with Darwiiz and Mwalim breaking into sometimes near-physical arguments in the street over a current debate of unusual controversy. Many citizens have witnessed the unprofessionalism of the supposed greatest minds of the country, and are deeply disappointed. We must take action to make sure this doesn’t happen again."
 rinta_seeker_events.60.a:0 "Favor the Mwalim"
 rinta_seeker_events.60.b:0 "Pick No Sides"
 rinta_seeker_events.60.c:0 "Favor The Darwiiz"

 rinta_seeker_events.61.t:0 "Divided Scholars"
 rinta_seeker_events.61.desc:0 "It’s not often that circles of Mwalim feel the need to beseech a secular ruler for their opinion on a matter of religious practice, as they generally settle debates within their own scholarly associations. However, the resident community of Mwalim in our capital have come to a disagreement on proper religious practice that seems to be so intractable that they’ve sought the ruler’s opinion as the ultimate source of law within the realm. When raced to the [root.monarch.GetTitle], the topic of debate is impossibly arcane and theoretical, leaving most of the court entirely perplexed. At the end of it all, both sides look to the [root.monarch.GetTitle] expectantly..."
 rinta_seeker_events.61.a:0 "They waste our time coming here with this nonsense!"
 rinta_seeker_events.61.b:0 "Pay for them to meet with other regional scholars to solve the debate"
 rinta_seeker_events.61.c:0 "Defer to your advisor on the topic"
 rinta_seeker_events.61.d:0 "Explain a profound reason as to why one side is correct"

 rinta_seeker_events.62.t:0 "Star Gazing"
 rinta_seeker_events.62.desc:0 "Late last night, [root.monarch.GetTitle] found themselves gazing up at the stars, puzzling over the configuration of the sky’s constellations, when they were suddenly struck by the realization of a complex pattern hidden deep within the positions of the stars. They rushed to sketch a copy of the pattern so that they could more closely examine its meaning yet, after a night of frenzied study, could not decipher anything of note. To this, the court steward offered to summon a learned individual who would be able to provide an alternative perspective."
 rinta_seeker_events.62.a:0 "Bring me the most knowledgeable Mwalim from the nearest observatory"
 rinta_seeker_events.62.b:0 "Only a true mystic can discern the hidden truth of this observation"

 rinta_seeker_events.80.t:0 "Studies Afar"
 rinta_seeker_events.80.desc:0 "The faith of Rinta Seekers teaches its followers to seek knowledge. Our people have done so, but many look to pursue such even further. More and more of our young have decided to study abroad, in hopes of bringing back the knowledge they learn and passing it on. This leaves us without manpower, as able-bodied peoples travel away from our lands. Our [root.monarch.GetTitle] must take action to decide whether to stop this trend or to let it continue in hopes of good returns."
 rinta_seeker_events.80.a:0 "Let it be"
 rinta_seeker_events.80.b:0 "Restrict it to only those who are worthy may go."
 rinta_seeker_events.80.c:0 "Don’t Let Them Leave!"

 rinta_seeker_events.81.t:0 "Returning Students"
 rinta_seeker_events.81.desc:0 "Students of the Rinta Seekers faith are constantly seeking out knowledge, even if that means going out to study abroad. Recently, we’ve had a massive influx of students returning and bringing knowledge from across Sarhal and even further afield. One of the most notable of these is a young scholar who is coming back from studying in Tianlou. He brings with him many new ideas, some of which have intrigued even the greatest minds of our country.\n\nUnfortunately for us, these ideas come along with certain mystical aspects that many consider fraudulent and heretical. The scholar claims that this is just the nature of what he has learned, and there is proof of his ideas being correct. Many are divisive on whether to accept these teachings or to send him back to Haless to confer with other heretics."
 rinta_seeker_events.81.a:0 "Let him stay"
 rinta_seeker_events.81.b:0 "Kick him out!"
 rinta_seeker_events.81.c:0 "Keep him, but make sure he doesn’t say anything too crazy"

 rinta_seeker_events.82.t:0 "A Puzzling Discovery"
 rinta_seeker_events.82.desc:0 "Today, a herald brought news to the court of the findings of an expedition within lizardfolk territory. While delving deep within a lizardfolk temple, they happened upon a glyph that exactly resembled one of the most sacred of geometries, the 8-segmented circle surrounded by inward facing triangles. The work is so distinctly in a Baashidi style that it seems like it could not possibly have been made by any other group, yet it bears the same level of wear as the surrounding ancient glyphs. The finding has mystified scholars at home, with some claiming it as a sign of the timeless truth of our teachings. Regardless, they have taken to searching for any logical explanation as to the glyph’s existence."
 rinta_seeker_events.82.a:0 "Logic is unnecessary, it is enough to meditate on another what is merely another emanation of truth"
 rinta_seeker_events.82.b:0 "This geometry has a very particular meaning, if we outfit a team to study the surrounding glyphs, they will likely show that the glyph was used to express a similar concept."
 rinta_seeker_events.82.c:0 "Have some members of our court lead an inquiry; if we delve further into the geometry itself, the underlying connection will surely be revealed"

 rinta_seeker_events.100.t:0 "Government Sponsored Studies"
 rinta_seeker_events.100.desc:0 "Recently, a famous organization of Mwalim from a college have asked for government funding in a study that they are doing. They state that they seek to use the money to delve into new experiments and ideas through the expansion of the school. Many Mwalim have shown support for this idea, despite its price. What should we do?"
 rinta_seeker_events.100.a:0 "Give them a generous donation"
 rinta_seeker_events.100.b:0 "Give them a small donation"
 rinta_seeker_events.100.c:0 "We’re spending too much money!"

 rinta_seeker_events.101.t:0 "Knowledgeable Leaders"
 rinta_seeker_events.101.desc:0 "Leaders amongst the Baashidi have often proven themselves some of the most knowledgeable in the world. Unfortunately for [root.monarch.GetName], people have begun to doubt [root.monarch.GetHerHis] knowledge. A group of Mwalim have appeared to [root.monarch.GetName] in court, antagonizing [root.monarch.GetHerHim]. This is obviously heresy of the highest degree, but [root.monarch.GetName] fears that if [root.monarch.GetSheHe] rids them from [root.monarch.GetHerHis] presence, then it will confirm their beliefs. What should [root.monarch.GetName] do?"
 rinta_seeker_events.101.a:0 "Maybe a “donation” would keep them quiet?"
 rinta_seeker_events.101.b:0 "I may not be the wisest, but I am always willing to learn."

 rinta_seeker_events.102.t:0 "Time To Study"
 rinta_seeker_events.102.desc:0 "[root.monarch.GetName] is often considered a fairly studious ruler. He has taken interest in many different subjects. Unfortunately for [root.monarch.GetHerHim], the obligations of rulership provide strain to the amount of time a ruler has available. It has noticeably taken a toll on [root.monarch.GetName], who seems to be longing to delve into a new study.\n\nThis has been coming to a head recently - with [root.monarch.GetHerHis] obligations taking up the entirety of the day, [root.monarch.GetSheHe] has been assigning more of them to [root.monarch.GetHerHis] advisors. Close friends of [root.monarch.GetName] have seen [root.monarch.GetHerHim] reading literature, while [root.monarch.GetHerHis] advisors have poorly managed the country, and have even taken bribes to enact things without [root.monarch.GetName]’s permission! What should be done?"
 rinta_seeker_events.102.a:0 "We need a leader, not a reader."
 rinta_seeker_events.102.b:0 "Moderation is key."
 rinta_seeker_events.102.c:0 "Let [root.monarch.GetName] do what [root.monarch.GetSheHe] wants"

 rinta_seeker_events.103.t:0 "Stagnation in the Abodes of Knowledge"
 rinta_seeker_events.103.desc:0 "Much of our scholarly society is organized into technical and academic associations, and local guilds of architects, astronomers, mathematicians and the like can be found in cities throughout the realm. These guilds are headed by bodies of their most learned individuals, who have studied and practiced for decades before holding their positions. Yet advancement in the guilds can often be as determined by one’s social aptitude as their intellectual capability, and a whole generation of journeymen scholars are beginning to call for systemic reform, lest they secede from the guilds and threaten their continued growth. These younger academics claim their aged counterparts are no longer dynamic in the methods by which they seek to rationalize the nature of Halann, and have become stagnant in their search for knowledge. They themselves claim to represent a new intellectual dynamism that can bring new life to the dying guilds, if only their skill could be properly recognized. As tensions rise, members of both sides appeal to the [root.monarch.GetTitle] to support their goals."
 rinta_seeker_events.103.a:0 "These youth do not realize that to understand Halaan requires a depth of study and patience."
 rinta_seeker_events.103.b:0 "To truly progress our study it must be necessary to occasionally reorganize."
