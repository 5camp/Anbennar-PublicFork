  diggy.5.t:0 "Apatite Layer"
  diggy.5.d:0 "Apatite is best known for its use as an index mineral with a hardness of 5 in the Dwohs Hardness Scale. It is usually green in color, but can be yellow, brown, blue, purple, pink, or colorless. These colors are often so vivid that apatite has frequently been cut as a gemstone. Apatite is a brittle material. It breaks by both fracture and cleavage, but the cleavage is generally indistinct.\n\nWe've faced such a minerals while digging, should we keep digging through it?"
  diggy.5.a:0 "OF COURSE!"
  diggy.5.b:0 "We can't handle the cost, let's find another way"
  
  diggy.6.t:0 "Orthoclase Layer"
  diggy.6.d:0 "Orthoclase is a feldspar mineral, one of the most abundant rock-forming minerals of the continental crust. Orthoclase is most widely known as the pink feldspar found in many granites and as the mineral assigned a hardness of "6" in the Dwohs hardness scale.\n\nOur brave miners have encountered such a mineral while digging, what should we do?"
  diggy.6.a:0 "We shall not slow down!"
  diggy.6.b:0 "Let's find another path"
  
  diggy.7.t:0 "Iron Pyrite Layer"
  diggy.7.d:0 "Pyrite is a brass-yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster, and is the most common sulfide mineral. It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs, usually in small quantities, in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks worldwide. Pyrite is so common that many dwarven geologists would consider it to be an ubiquitous mineral. Such a material is now on our way."
  diggy.7.a:0 "No Pyrite shall block our way!"
  diggy.7.b:0 "Try to dig through another path"
  
  diggy.8.t:0 "Spinel Layer"
  diggy.8.d:0 "Spinel is an oxide mineral,  (7.5 to 8 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale) and is often found in octahedral crystals. It is typically found in three geologic situations: 1) as crystals in limestones and dolomites that have been subjected to contact metamorphism; 2) irregularly-shaped grains in basic igneous rocks; and, 3) as water-worn pebbles in alluvial deposits. It's seem we have a found a huge deposit of it, in the way of our digging operations."
  diggy.8.a:0 "What's the problem? Dig through it!"
  diggy.8.b:0 "Maybe we should rethink our strategy..."
 
  diggy.9.t:0 "Corundum Layer"
  diggy.9.d:0 "Corundum is a rock-forming mineral that is found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, with a value of 9 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale. The mineral is widely known for its extreme hardness and for the fact that it is sometimes found as beautiful transparent crystals in many different colors. The extreme hardness makes corundum an excellent abrasive, and when that hardness is found in beautiful crystals, you have the perfect material for cutting gemstones.\n\nWe've encountered a massive layer of it. How should we proceed ?"
  diggy.9.a:0 "Nothing shall stop us."
  diggy.9.b:0 "Maybe if we go a little more to the left?..."
  
  diggy.10.t:0 "Carbonadwo Layer"
  diggy.10.d:0 "Carbonadwo diamonds are a rare and unusual variety of diamond. When found in the field, they look nothing like any other type of diamond. They are dark, opaque, porous, and often display a subtle luster. They are composed almost entirely of microcrystalline diamonds in random crystallographic orientations. The name "black diamond" is sometimes used for carbonadwo, however that name should be reserved for diamonds with a black body color often caused by clouds of tiny black inclusions or by carbonization of fracture surfaces.\n\nThis is the hardest layer we've ever encountered. (10 oh the Dwohs Hardness Scale)"
  diggy.10.a:0 "Finally, a worthy opponent!"
  diggy.10.b:0 "I don't want our battle to be legendary..."
