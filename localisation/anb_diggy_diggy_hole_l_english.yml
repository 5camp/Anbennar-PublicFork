  diggy.1.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Hold"
  diggy.1.d:0 "After many years of effort, we have finally finished the new districts of our Hold. This feat of architecture and engineering offers us many opportunities for expansion in the future."
  diggy.1.a:0 "[Root.strikeTheEarth] strike the [Root.swearAtTheEarth] earth!"
  
  diggy.2.t:0 "Demands of Labour"
  diggy.2.d:0 "With the construction of our hold continuing, one cannot help but think it could be done at a faster pace. Though it may be quite an expensive undertaking, if we were to devote yet more of our nation's resources to meeting the various demands of construction, we could surely have our hold completed in record time!"
  diggy.2.a:0 "Construction is paramount, no matter the cost"
  diggy.2.b:0 "Everything seems to be fine as it is"
  
  diggy.3.t:0 "A Beautiful Hold"
  diggy.3.d:0 "With continual advancements of hold construction in [Root.GetName], several prominent members of our more artistic community: artists, stonecarvers, and various others, have brought a proposal to the forefront. As a demonstration of our culture, they say, our hold too must in and of itself be a work of art. To implement this would surely take large amounts of time and resources away from other projects, but perhaps, like all art, true beauty is worth the price?"
  diggy.3.a:0 "Let us build a beautiful hold"
  diggy.3.b:0 "Operations will continue as before"
  
  diggy.4.t:0 "Military Labourers"
  diggy.4.d:0 "Though many are willing to work to construct our great hold, there are limited numbers of those willing to work. Yet, it seems that we have a vast, untapped labour supply in the form of our army. Using military personnel for construction would certainly help the process, but our generals worry about the impact this move could have on our army. So, we must choose our priorities: our hold, or our army?"
  diggy.4.a:0 "Our army is worthless if it has nothing to defend"
  diggy.4.b:0 "Our hold is worthless if there is no one to defend it"
  
  diggy.5.t:0 "Apatite Layer"
  diggy.5.d:0 "Apatite is best known for its use as an index mineral with a hardness of 5 in the Dwohs Hardness Scale. It is usually green in color, but can be yellow, brown, blue, purple, pink, or colorless. These colors are often so vivid that apatite has frequently been cut as a gemstone. Apatite is a brittle material. It breaks by both fracture and cleavage, but the cleavage is generally indistinct.\n\nWe've faced such a minerals while digging, should we keep digging through it?"
  diggy.5.a:0 "OF COURSE!"
  diggy.5.b:0 "We can't handle the cost, let's find another way"
  
  diggy.6.t:0 "Orthoclase Layer"
  diggy.6.d:0 "Orthoclase is a feldspar mineral, one of the most abundant rock-forming minerals of the continental crust. Orthoclase is most widely known as the pink feldspar found in many granites and as the mineral assigned a hardness of "6" in the Dwohs hardness scale.\n\nOur brave miners have encountered such a mineral while digging, what should we do?"
  diggy.6.a:0 "We shall not slow down!"
  diggy.6.b:0 "Let's find another path"
  
  diggy.7.t:0 "Iron Pyrite Layer"
  diggy.7.d:0 "Pyrite is a brass-yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster, and is the most common sulfide mineral. It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs, usually in small quantities, in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks worldwide. Pyrite is so common that many dwarven geologists would consider it to be an ubiquitous mineral. Such a material is now on our way."
  diggy.7.a:0 "No Pyrite shall block our way!"
  diggy.7.b:0 "Try to dig through another path"
  
  diggy.8.t:0 "Spinel Layer"
  diggy.8.d:0 "Spinel is an oxide mineral,  (7.5 to 8 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale) and is often found in octahedral crystals. It is typically found in three geologic situations: 1) as crystals in limestones and dolomites that have been subjected to contact metamorphism; 2) irregularly-shaped grains in basic igneous rocks; and, 3) as water-worn pebbles in alluvial deposits. It seems we have found a huge deposit of it, in the way of our digging operations."
  diggy.8.a:0 "What's the problem? Dig through it!"
  diggy.8.b:0 "Maybe we should rethink our strategy..."
 
  diggy.9.t:0 "Corundum Layer"
  diggy.9.d:0 "Corundum is a rock-forming mineral that is found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, with a value of 9 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale. The mineral is widely known for its extreme hardness and for the fact that it is sometimes found as beautiful transparent crystals in many different colors. The extreme hardness makes corundum an excellent abrasive, and when that hardness is found in beautiful crystals, you have the perfect material for cutting gemstones.\n\nWe've encountered a massive layer of it. How should we proceed ?"
  diggy.9.a:0 "Nothing shall stop us."
  diggy.9.b:0 "Maybe if we go a little more to the left?..."
  
  diggy.10.t:0 "Carbonadwo Layer"
  diggy.10.d:0 "Carbonadwo diamonds are a rare and unusual variety of diamond. When found in the field, they look nothing like any other type of diamond. They are dark, opaque, porous, and often display a subtle luster. They are composed almost entirely of microcrystalline diamonds in random crystallographic orientations. The name "black diamond" is sometimes used for carbonadwo, however that name should be reserved for diamonds with a black body color often caused by clouds of tiny black inclusions or by carbonization of fracture surfaces.\n\nThis is the hardest layer we've ever encountered. (10 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale)"
  diggy.10.a:0 "Finally, a worthy opponent!"
  diggy.10.b:0 "I don't want our battle to be legendary..."
  
  diggy.11.t:0 "Having a Blast"
  diggy.11.d:0 "Several mining engineers have come to us over the last few days with a single word on their minds: explosives. We aren't sure how safe these explosives are, or even how our engineers even got their hands on them, but they assure us that these will surely speed up the construction of our hold. The engineers in question do seem quite eager, perhaps a little too eager..."
  diggy.11.a:0 "How could this possibly go wrong?"
  diggy.11.b:0 "What do you mean, "technically safe"?"
  
  diggy.12.t:0 "Restoration of [Root.GetName]"
  diggy.12.d:0 "After many years of work, [Root.GetName] has been restored to its former glory! We have faced many trials and tribulations, but surely, with the hold functioning once more, we will be able to truly build our nation up, or in this case down, towards a better tomorrow!"
  diggy.12.a:0 "Fantastic!"
  
  diggy.13.t:0 "Capture of [Root.GetName]"
  diggy.13.d:0 "The battle for [Root.GetName] was long and harsh, and many noble warrior died. The fierce battle that took place severely damaged the hold, but it's nothing that cannot be repaired in the long run."
  diggy.13.a:0 "Such is the nature of war"
  
  diggy.14.t:0 "Gas Explosion"
  diggy.14.d:0 "A spark. A single damned spark. That was all that it took for the gas pocket to ignite, and our entire shaft to explode. The tunnel has since collapsed, and our miners have, unfortunately, died, as there was nowhere near enough warning for them to evacuate."
  diggy.14.a:0 "Damn it!"
  
  diggy.15.t:0 "Ancient Treasure"
  diggy.15.d:0 "As the rock fell away, our miners saw a most wondrous sight. An ancient chamber, full to the brim with ancient Dwarven relics, dating all the way back to the time of Aul-Dwarov. But even more important than that, they seem to be made out of pure, solid gold!"
  diggy.15.a:0 "Melt them down!"
  diggy.15.b:0 "Create a Museum"
  diggy.15.c:0 "Surely this can't be it? Dig deeper!"
  diggy.15.e:0 "It may be best to leave them be..."
  
  diggy.16.t:0 "An Old Hold"
  diggy.16.d:0 "As the stone crumbles away, a sight is revealed to our miners unlike anything else. An entire abandoned Hold, deep underground, entirely lost to time! The idea of exploring this new hold is popular, especially amongst local adventurers, as it promises adventure, danger, glory, insight into the past, and most importantly, treasure! Some, however, warn against it, and worry of the dangers that this hold could present to our people."
  diggy.16.a:0 "For trea- I mean, for adventure!"
  diggy.16.b:0 "Perhaps it was abandoned for a reason..."
  
  diggy.17.t:0 "Cave Collapse!"
  diggy.17.d:0 "A single loose beam was all that it took for our mineshaft to come crashing down, with scores of miners buried alive underneath vast tonnes of rock. Our mining efforts have been set back, and their families have been informed of the loss. Though tragic, this will surely be only one accident amongst many in the name of our hold's progress."
  diggy.17.a:0 "We must continue!"
  
  diggy.18.t:0 "Soft Rock"
  diggy.18.d:0 "It seems that fortune smiles upon us, as our miners have come to a section of rock that seems to almost melt away upon striking. Our mining efforts continue well above schedule, and this will surely help with our hold's continued expansion."
  diggy.18.a:0 "Keep up the good work!"
  
  diggy.19.t:0 "Blood and Sweat"
  diggy.19.d:0 "Our miners have come across rock that, itself, breaks all but the strongest of mining equipment. And yet, our determined brethren continue. Through pain, they mine. Through sweat, they mine. Through sheer force of will, they mine."
  diggy.19.a:0 "Rise through willpower!"
  
  diggy.20.t:0 "Two Miners, One Magical Mineral"
  diggy.20.d:0 "Word has reach us of a great discovery! In one of the many tunnels that snake their way through our hold, two miners have come across a vast deposit of the magical mineral, damestear - a main ingredient in things all magic from artificery to enchantments. Up until this point they have been speaking almost in unison, but soon, the two begin bickering between each other about something. Eventually, the first miner speaks, and says that the damestear must be mined and exploited for the benefit of our great nation, and would surely bring great riches. The second, however, raises her voice, and loudly proclaims that mining damestear would, rather than riches, bring great danger, and not be worth the risk to extract."
  diggy.20.a:0 "Great riches, you say?"
  diggy.20.b:0 "Safety first."
  
  diggy.21.t:0 "Damestear Explosion"
  diggy.21.d:0 "The ground trembles. Walls shake. Rubble falls loose from the cavern roof. The screams of those still in the mines reverberate across the hold. A single note sits before you. It contains but four words: 'I told you so'."
  diggy.21.a:0 "Why me?"
  
  diggy.22.t:0 "Goblin Ambush"
  diggy.22.d:0 "Miners enter a cavern. Beyond the light of their torches, there is only darkness. They tread carefully, wary of disturbing any traps that may be lying there. The cavern is silent, but for the soft crackling of their torches. Then, arrows fly. The torches clatter to the ground, and are snuffed upon the cold stone floor. For a few seconds, there is naught but darkness. And then, in an instant, the darkness is pierced by the glow of hundreds of glowing yellow eyes."
  diggy.22.a:0 "Ready your weapons!"
  
  diggy.23.t:0 "Orcish Opposition"
  diggy.23.d:0 "As the walls fall away, a fearsome sight stands to greet us: a cavern filled to the brim with hostile orcs. In an instant, battle breaks out, quickly spreading as at once, we send down reinforcements, and the orcs seem to somehow continue to swell their numbers."
  diggy.23.a:0 "Stand your ground!"
  
  diggy.24.t:0 "Beautiful Cavern"
  diggy.24.d:0 "Upon first inspection, the cavern appears to be like any other, a small opening within the mountain, filled with air rather than earth. Upon first inspection, that is. For once you enter the cavern, its truly wondrous properties become apparent. The walls seem to be entirely encrusted with crystals, which seem to, when light is shone upon them, reflect light in such a way as to create a complete tapestry of light, winding, twirling, and shifting as the light sources move. This may be the closest that we ever get to true beauty."
  diggy.24.a:0 "How much do you think those crystals are worth?"
  diggy.24.b:0 "Open the cavern to all! For a price, of course..."
  
  diggy.25.t:0 "Beautiful Cavern Profits"
  diggy.25.d:0 "Across our hold, people flock to see the wondrous cavern we have discovered! Commoners and elites alike are left dumbstruck by the beauty of the changing and shifting patterns of the lights. It has inspired many pieces in our hold's more artistic community, but even the artists themselves agree that they cannot truly recapture the beauty of the cavern itself."
  diggy.25.a:0 "Superb!"
  diggy.25.b:0 "Eureka!"
  spark_tooltip:0 "§GYour ruler suddenly had a spark of genius!\nWhile some in the country doesn't understand and critize his ideas, it look like some great things are to come...§! "
  
  spark_tooltip:0 "§G[Root.Monarch.GetName] has had a spark of genius!§!"
  
  diggy.26.t:0 "Unstable Foundations"
  diggy.26.d:0 "The stone seems to split and crack, as an entire section of our hold, brand new, sinks deep into the mountain. Upon investigation, it appears that the specific structures were built upon an underground river, and with enough construction and erosion, the stone simply could not hold. Fortunately, those who were present at the time were able to be rescued, and although there were many injuries, there were thankfully no deaths."
  diggy.26.a:0 "Who approved this?"
  
  diggy.27.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Hold Specialization"
  diggy.27.d:0 "As our hold progresses ever deeper in the earth it has come to our attention that like the days of Aul-Dwarov, that a hold must specialize to witness its true potential. From now on, [Root.GetName] must specialize on a certain aspect of our country, on what natural resources and opportunities the hold has available.\n\nWill it focus on the infrastructure of a foundry hold, full of conveyors, tracks and great forges to to out-scale any other metal production? What about infrastructure to maintain an even higher population? A Metropolis? Houses stacked upon houses carved upon the walls of the Dwarovar where city and commercial business can flourish alike. Maybe a hold to focus on the finer arts? A hold beautifully crafted with elegant architecture to please and inspire our master artisans and crafters. Maybe it will have the infrastructure to support vast vertical farms so that our hold will be green with plant life to feed our people? Or perhaps the hold will lean towards military matters, with large fortifications and massive roads so to defend ourselves against outsiders, both above and below?\n\nOnly time will tell what our hold with specialize in."

  diggy.28.t:0 "News of an Orc Warband"
  diggy.28.d:0 "Armies move quickly in the mountains, but news moves quicker. Messengers come to us with a single, dire warning: an orc warband approaches our territory. With it, comes the tide of war."
  diggy.28.a:0 "We must prepare for the coming storm"
  
  diggy.29.t:0 "Warband Arrives"
  diggy.29.d:0 "Our lands have, once again, been attacked by a vast orc warband. The coming battle will be harsh, but we can, nay, we must pull through! These orcs would see us slaughtered, but it is not us who shall be dying this day!"
  diggy.29.a:0 "To arms!"
  
  diggy.30.t:0 "Serpentsmite"
  diggy.30.d:0 "Is this the end? The mountains themselves seem to roar with rage, as an earthquake unlike any seen in living memory shakes our hold to its very core. Great cracks form in the rock, swallowing buildings whole, and rubble falls from above, shattering structures and burying dwarves alive. For a full hour, the quake continues, reaping ever more damage as the seconds go by. And then, just as suddenly as it began, it ceases. The damage is immense, and many of our resources are taken up simply keeping our hold in one piece. Now, however, a choice now lies before us; this great quake, which split open the core of our hold, has revealed many precious minerals that were previously undiscovered. Due to the unstable nature of the fissures, access to these minerals will likely be short-lived. We could devote effort to harvesting these resources, but this would surely take away from the efforts to rescue and treat survivors."

Unfortunately in the course of his research, he deliberately infected himself with the Rot in order to view the results of his work, and though he could slow the disease, he could not halt it. Worse, besides the loss of one of our best minds, he was not able to properly explain his research before his untimely demise. His peers are already trying to decipher his notes."

  I23_nation_desc:0 "Now we have a suitable foothold in the surface mountains, we can create a new authority that is more capable of things other than war: Haraz Dhûmankon, also known as the High Dominion - a frontier region of our greater under-empire."
  I24_nation_title:0 "Restore the Dwarven Empire"
  I24_nation_desc:0 "Aul-Dwarov. The Empire of the Dwarves. Literally known as All-Dwarves Home. Once the bastion of the ancient world, way before any sort of human or elf had any sort of urgency or glory. It fell due to dwarven infighting and the repulsive scourge that is orckind and the Dwarovar lays in darkness in ruin. Only a true heir of the Dwarovar, one that is resolute against all odds could restore such an ancient and old dominion."
  I25_nation_title:0 "Refound Verkal Dromak"
  I25_nation_desc:0 "A reclusive hold nestled deep in the hills and mountains, Verkal Dromak was known as the Citadel of Dreamers, and where outcast philosophers, wildcards and seers fled after being ostracized from Dûr-Vazhatun."
  H79_nation_title:0 "Resurrect Ovdal Kanzad"
  H79_nation_desc:0 "Known as Cannonhold, Ovdal Kanzad was the principal firearm and cannon manufacturer in Aul-Dwarov, fashioning weapons of mass destruction before the first man had learned to wield a sword. Its inhabitants are known as Amber dwarves due to their proximity to the Tree of Stone, but in fact gain their yellowish tinge from the sulfur used in such weaponry. The cannon refineries of the hold lay quiet, until a true master of arms re-awakens them once again!"
  F47_nation_title:0 "Resurrect Verkal Gulan"
  F47_nation_desc:0 "The hold of Verkal Gulan was one of the few to survive the fall of the Segbandal. However in isolation its people became complacent and corrupt. Its eventual fall was no surprise. Now the hold has been reclaimed by dwarves pure of heart. We will restore the hold to its former glory and beyond. The Golden Citadel will rise again!"
  H78_nation_title:0 "Resurrect Seghdihr"
  H78_nation_desc:0 "Known as Southgate, Seghdihr gained its prominence after the fall of the Dwarovar, and was the leader of the Segbandal (the Southern Alliance) which for a time maintained relative security in the Middle Dwarovar until its dissolution. Perhaps a true heir of the Segbandal will rise and reclaim Seghdihr once again?"
  H77_nation_title:0 "Resurrect Ovdal Lodhum" 
  H77_nation_desc:0 "Ovdal Lodhum was known as the Hold where Love Lives, and was known for its beautiful architecture and as a perfect honeymoon spot for newlywed dwarves of the old empire. After the fall, it was one of the few holds that survived - after all, love always prevails."
  H76_nation_title:0 "Resurrect Arg-Ôrdstun"
  H76_nation_desc:0 "The nominal capital of the Serpent's Reach, Arg-Ôrdstun was home to the proud and strong diamond dwarves who in their time often challenged the authority of the High King of Aul-Dwarov. If this hold is ever restored, perhaps the days of Ôrdstunic power will one day return?"

  DADV_mapping_the_dwarovar_desc:0 "The tunnels and caverns of the Dwarovar are magnificent and daunting, and the myths and legends of our ancestral knowledge will not suffice for real navigation. For that, we will need to outfit a scouting expedition."
  DADV_ally_in_the_dark_title:0 "Ally in the Dark"
  DADV_ally_in_the_dark_desc:0 "Threats lurk around every corner. To stand alone against the monstrous tides of darkness would be near-suicidal. Surely we can find friends somewhere in these tunnels?"
  
  DADV_defence_forces_title:0 "Defence Forces"
  DADV_defence_forces_desc:0 "The disgusting creatures who have lived in the Dwarovar since the departure of our ancestors must be dealt with if our settlers are to have peace. A large, professional defense force is needed to protect our burgeoning colonies."
  DADV_never_again_title:0 "Never Again"
  DADV_never_again_desc:0 "Now that the light of dwarven civilization has returned to illuminate the tunnels, we must ensure that it is never again snuffed out. Fortifications and defensive structures protecting our hold will keep the nightmares at bay. Perhaps, through these efforts, we might dig in peace."
  DADV_ancestors_smile_title:0 "Ancestors Smile"

  DADV_fungal_farm_title:0 "Fungal Farm"
  DADV_fungal_farm_desc:0 "The environment of the Dwarovar does not lend itself to the sort of agriculture that occurs on the surface, however, many fungal lifeforms have adapted to these conditions. We must begin the large-scale cultivation of these fungi so that we might feed our growing population."

  DADV_more_for_the_hoard_title:0 "More for the Hoard"
  DADV_more_for_the_hoard_desc:0 "Other races may call us greedy. We prefer to call ourselves 'prudent', or perhaps 'prepared'. Besides, why live in a mountain if you can't extract fabulous amounts of wealth from it?"
  DADV_restoring_the_rail_title:0 "Restoring the Rail"
  DADV_restoring_the_rail_desc:0 "A great rail once ran the length of the Dwarovar, and the remnants of this structure still remain. It is our duty as the children of the Dwarovar to ensure this marvel of engineerinig is fully operational once again."

  DADV_controlled_expansion_title:0 "Controlled Expansion"
  DADV_controlled_expansion_desc:0 "The process of colonization has been chaotic and disorganized up to this point due to our relative lack of administrative resources. By developing a systematic, state-sponsored approach to settlement we can expand in a far more logical and orderly fashion."

  DADV_resettling_the_serpentspine_desc: "The growing comfort of our home territories has the unfortunate side effect of making it less appealing to become a colonist. With the proper incentive structure, a greater percentage of our growing population can be devoted to the settlement effort."
  DADV_exploit_the_caverns_title: "Exploit the Caverns"
  DADV_exploit_the_caverns_desc: "The Dwarovar is home to a great many caverns. Individually, they are not as valuable as our core settlements. In large numbers, however, these rural territories will provide the raw resources to forge a new future for our people."
