  diggy.1.t:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] Hold"
  diggy.1.d:0 "After many years of effort, we have finally finished the new districts of our Hold. This feat of architecture and engineering offers us many opportunities for expansion for the future."
  diggy.1.a:0 "[Root.strikeTheEarth] strike the [Root.swearAtTheEarth] earth!"
  
  diggy.2.t:0 "Demands of Labour"
  diggy.2.d:0 "With the construction of our hold continuing, one cannot help but think it could be done at a faster pace. Though it may be quite an expensive undertaking, if we were to devote yet more of our nation's resources to meeting the various demands of construction, we could surely have our hold completed in record time!"
  diggy.2.a:0 "Construction is paramount, no matter the cost"
  diggy.2.b:0 "Everything seems to be fine as it is"
  
  diggy.3.t:0 "A Beautiful Hold"
  diggy.3.d:0 "With continual advancements of hold construction in [Root.GetName], several prominant members of our more artistic community; artists, stonecarvers, and various others, have brought a proposal to the forefront. As a demonstration of our culture, they say, our hold too must in and of itself be a work of art. To implement this would surely take large amounts of time and resources away from other projects, but perhaps, like all art, true beauty is worth the price?"
  diggy.3.a:0 "Let us build a beautiful hold"
  diggy.3.b:0 "Operations will continue as before"
  
  diggy.4.t:0 "Military Labourers"
  diggy.4.d:0 "Though many are willing to work to construct our great hold, there are limited numbers of those willing to work. Yet, it seems that we have a vast, untapped labour supply in the form of our army. Using military personnel for cunstruction would certainly help the process, but our generals worry about the impact this move could have on our army. So, we must choose our priorities; our hold, or our army?"
  diggy.4.a:0 "Our army is worthless if it has nothing to defend"
  diggy.4.b:0 "Our hold is worthless if there is noone to defend it"
  
  diggy.5.t:0 "Apatite Layer"
  diggy.5.d:0 "Apatite is best known for its use as an index mineral with a hardness of 5 in the Dwohs Hardness Scale. It is usually green in color, but can be yellow, brown, blue, purple, pink, or colorless. These colors are often so vivid that apatite has frequently been cut as a gemstone. Apatite is a brittle material. It breaks by both fracture and cleavage, but the cleavage is generally indistinct.\n\nWe've faced such a minerals while digging, should we keep digging through it?"
  diggy.5.a:0 "OF COURSE!"
  diggy.5.b:0 "We can't handle the cost, let's find another way"
  
  diggy.6.t:0 "Orthoclase Layer"
  diggy.6.d:0 "Orthoclase is a feldspar mineral, one of the most abundant rock-forming minerals of the continental crust. Orthoclase is most widely known as the pink feldspar found in many granites and as the mineral assigned a hardness of "6" in the Dwohs hardness scale.\n\nOur brave miners have encountered such a mineral while digging, what should we do?"
  diggy.6.a:0 "We shall not slow down!"
  diggy.6.b:0 "Let's find another path"
  
  diggy.7.t:0 "Iron Pyrite Layer"
  diggy.7.d:0 "Pyrite is a brass-yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster, and is the most common sulfide mineral. It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs, usually in small quantities, in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks worldwide. Pyrite is so common that many dwarven geologists would consider it to be an ubiquitous mineral. Such a material is now on our way."
  diggy.7.a:0 "No Pyrite shall block our way!"
  diggy.7.b:0 "Try to dig through another path"
  
  diggy.8.t:0 "Spinel Layer"
  diggy.8.d:0 "Spinel is an oxide mineral,  (7.5 to 8 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale) and is often found in octahedral crystals. It is typically found in three geologic situations: 1) as crystals in limestones and dolomites that have been subjected to contact metamorphism; 2) irregularly-shaped grains in basic igneous rocks; and, 3) as water-worn pebbles in alluvial deposits. It's seem we have a found a huge deposit of it, in the way of our digging operations."
  diggy.8.a:0 "What's the problem? Dig through it!"
  diggy.8.b:0 "Maybe we should rethink our strategy..."
 
  diggy.9.t:0 "Corundum Layer"
  diggy.9.d:0 "Corundum is a rock-forming mineral that is found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, with a value of 9 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale. The mineral is widely known for its extreme hardness and for the fact that it is sometimes found as beautiful transparent crystals in many different colors. The extreme hardness makes corundum an excellent abrasive, and when that hardness is found in beautiful crystals, you have the perfect material for cutting gemstones.\n\nWe've encountered a massive layer of it. How should we proceed ?"
  diggy.9.a:0 "Nothing shall stop us."
  diggy.9.b:0 "Maybe if we go a little more to the left?..."
  
  diggy.10.t:0 "Carbonadwo Layer"
  diggy.10.d:0 "Carbonadwo diamonds are a rare and unusual variety of diamond. When found in the field, they look nothing like any other type of diamond. They are dark, opaque, porous, and often display a subtle luster. They are composed almost entirely of microcrystalline diamonds in random crystallographic orientations. The name "black diamond" is sometimes used for carbonadwo, however that name should be reserved for diamonds with a black body color often caused by clouds of tiny black inclusions or by carbonization of fracture surfaces.\n\nThis is the hardest layer we've ever encountered. (10 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale)"
  diggy.10.a:0 "Finally, a worthy opponent!"
  diggy.10.b:0 "I don't want our battle to be legendary..."
  
  diggy.11.t:0 "Having a Blast"
  diggy.11.d:0 "Several mining engineers have come to us over the last few days with a single word on their minds; explosives. We aren't sure how safe these explosives are, or even how our engineers even got their hands on them, but they assure us that these will surely speed up the construction of our hold. The engineers in question do seem quite eager, perhaps a little too eager..."
  diggy.11.a:0 "How could this possibly go wrong?"
  diggy.11.b:0 "What do you mean, "technically safe"?"
  
  diggy.12.t:0 "Restoration of [Root.GetName]"
  diggy.12.d:0 "After many years of work, [Root.GetName] has been restored to its former glory! We have faced many trials and tribulations, but surely, with the hold functioning once more, we will be able to truly build our nation up, or in this case down, towards a better tomorrow!"
  diggy.12.a:0 "Fantastic!"
  
  diggy.13.t:0 "Capture of [Root.GetName]"
  diggy.13.d:0 "The battle for [Root.GetName] was long and harsh, and many a noble warrior has died, but we have managed to finally capture the hold. The required efforts to captured the hold has damaged it significantly, but its nothing that cannot be repaired in the long run."
  diggy.13.a:0 "Such is the nature of war"
  
  diggy.14.t:0 "Gas Explosion"
  diggy.14.d:0 "A spark. A single damned spark. That was all that it took for the gas pocket to ignite, and our entire shaft to explode. The tunnel has since collapsed, and our miners have, unfortunately, died, as there was nowhere near enough warning for them to evacuate."
  diggy.14.a:0 "Damn it!"
  
  diggy.15.t:0 "Ancient Treasure"
  diggy.15.d:0 "As the rock fell away, our miners saw a most wonderous sight. An ancient chamber, full to the brim with ancient Dwarven relics, dating all the way back to the time of Aul-Dwarov. But even more important than that, they seem to be made out of pure, solid gold!"
  diggy.15.a:0 "Melt them down!"
  diggy.15.b:0 "Create a Museum"
  diggy.15.c:0 "Surely this can't be it? Dig deeper!"
  diggy.15.e:0 "It may be best to leave them be..."
  
  diggy.16.t:0 "An Old Hold"
  diggy.16.d:0 "As the stone crumbles away, a sight is revealed to our miners unlike anything else. An entire abandoned Hold, deep underground, entirely lost to time! The idea of exploring this new hold is popular, especially amongst local adventurers, as it promises adventure, danger, glory, insight into the past, and most importantly, treasure! Some, however, warn against it, and worry of the dangers that this hold could present to our people."
  diggy.16.a:0 "For trea- I mean, for adventure!"
  diggy.16.b:0 "Perhaps it was abandoned for a reason..."
  
  diggy.17.t:0 "Cave Collapse!"
  diggy.17.d:0 "A single loose beam was all that it took for our mineshaft to come crashing down, with scores of miners buried alive underneath vast tonnes of rock. Our mining efforts have been set back, and their families have been informed of the loss. Though tragic, this will surely be only one accident amongst many in the name of our Hold's progress."
  diggy.17.a:0 "We must continue!"
  
  diggy.18.t:0 "Soft Rock"
  diggy.18.d:0 "It seems that fortune smiles upon us, as our miners have come to a section of rock that seems to almost melt away upon striking. Our mining efforts continue well above schedule, and this will surely help with our hold's continued expansion."
  diggy.18.a:0 "Keep up the good work!"
  
  diggy.19.t:0 "Blood and Sweat"
  diggy.19.d:0 "Our miners have come accross rock that, itself, breaks all but the strongest of mining equipment. And yet, our determined brethren continue. Through pain, they mine. Through sweat, they mine. Through sheer force of will, they mine."
  diggy.19.a:0 "Rise through willpower!"
  
  diggy.20.t:0 "Two Miners, One Magical Mineral"
  diggy.20.d:0 "Word has reach us of a great discovery! In one of the many tunnels that snake their way through our hold, two miners have come across a vast deposit of the magical mineral, damestear - a main ingredient in things all magic from artificery to enchantments. Up until this point they have been speaking almost in unison, but soon, the two begin bickering between each other about something. Eventually, the first miner speaks, and says that the damestear must be mined and exploited for the benefit of our great nation, and would surely bring great riches. The second, however, raises her voice, and loudly proclaims that mining damestear would, rather than riches, bring great danger, and not be worth the risk to extract."
  diggy.20.a:0 "Great riches, you say?"
  diggy.20.b:0 "Safety first."
  
  diggy.21.t:0 "Damestear Explosion"
  diggy.21.d:0 "The ground tembles. Walls shake. Rubble falls loose from the cavern roof. The screams of those still in the mines reverbate accross the Hold. A single note sits before you. It contains but four words; 'I told you so'."
  diggy.21.a:0 "Why me?"
  
  diggy.22.t:0 "Goblin Ambush"
  diggy.22.d:0 "Miners enter a cavern. Beyond the light of their torches, there is only darkness. They tread carefully, wary of disturbing any traps that may be lying there. The cavern is silent, but for the soft crackling of their torches. Then, arrows fly. The torches clatter to the ground, and are snuffed upon the cold stone floor. For a few seconds, there is naught but darkness. And then, in an instant, the darkness is pierced by the glow of hundreds of glowing yellow eyes."
  diggy.22.a:0 "Ready your weapons!"
  
  diggy.23.t:0 "Orcish Opposition"
  diggy.23.d:0 "As the walls fall away, a fearsome sight stands to greet us; a cavern filled to the brim with hostile orcs. In an instant, battle breaks out, quickly spreading as at once, we send down reinforcements, and the orcs seem to somehow continue to swell their numbers."
  diggy.23.a:0 "Stand your ground!"
  
  diggy.24.t:0 "Beautiful Cavern"
  diggy.24.d:0 "Upon first inspection, the cavern appears to be like any other, a small opening within the mountain, filled with air rather than earth. Upon first inspection, that is. For once you enter the cavern, it's truly wonderous properties become apparent. The walls seem to be entirely encrusted with crystals, which seem to, when light is shone upon them, reflect light in such a way as to create a complete tapestry of light, winding, twirling, and shifting as the light sources move. This may be the closest that we ever get to true beauty."
  diggy.24.a:0 "How much do you think those crystals are worth?"
  diggy.24.b:0 "Open the cavern to all! For a price, of course..."
  
  diggy.25.t:0 "Beautiful Cavern Profits"
  diggy.25.d:0 "Across our hold, people flock to see the wondrous cavern we have discovered! Commoners and elites alike are left dumbstruck by the beauty of the changing and shifting patterns of the lights. It has inspired many pieces in our hold's more artistic community, but even the artists themselves agree that they cannot truly recapture the beauty of the cavern itself."
  diggy.25.a:0 "Superb!"
  diggy.25.b:0 "This seems too good to be true"
  
  diggy.26.t:0 "Unstable Foundations"
  diggy.26.d:0 "The stone seems to split and crack, as an entire section of our hold, brand new, sinks deep into the mountain. Upon investigation, it appears that the specific structures were built upon an underground river, and with enough construction and erosion, the stone simply could not hold. Fortunately, those who were present at the time were able to be rescued, and although there were many injuries, there were thankfully no deaths."
  diggy.26.a:0 "Who approved this?"
  
  diggy.27.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Hold Specialization"
  diggy.27.d:0 "As our hold progresses ever deeper in the earth it has come to our attention that like the days of Aul-Dwarov, that a hold must specialize to witness its true potential. From now on, we must design the infrastructure [Root.GetName] to specialize on a certain aspect of our country.\n\nShall we build infrastructure for a foundry hold, full of conveyors, tracks and great forges to to outscale any other metal production? What about infrastructure to maintain an even higher populatiom? A Metropolis? Houses stacked upon houses carved upon the walls of the Dwarovar where city and commercial business can flourish alike. Maybe a hold to focus on the finer arts? A hold beautifully crafted with elegant architecture to please and inspire our master artisans and crafters. Shall build infrastructure to support vast vertical farms so that our hold will be green with plantlife to feed our people? Or shall we give our hold over to military matters, with large fortifications and massive roads so to defend ourselves against outsiders, both above and below?"

  diggy.28.t:0 "News of Orc Warband"
  diggy.28.d:0 "Armies move quickly in the mountains, but news moves quicker. Messengers come to us with a single, dire warning; an Orc warband approaches our territory. With it, comes the tide of war."
  diggy.28.a:0 "We must prepare for the coming storm"
  
  diggy.29.t:0 "Warband Arrives"
  diggy.29.d:0 "Our lands have, once again, been attacked by a vast Orc warband. The coming battle will be harsh, but we can, nay, we must pull through! These Orcs would see us slaughtered, but it is not us who shall be dying this day!"
  diggy.29.a:0 "To arms!"
  
  diggy.30.t:0 "Serpentsmite"
  diggy.30.d:0 "Is this the end? The mountains themselves seem to roar with rage, as an earthquake unlike any seen in living memory shakes our hold to its very core. Great cracks form in the rock, swallowing buildings whole, and rubble falls from above, shattering structures and burying dwarves alive. For a full hour, the quake continues, reaping ever more damage as the seconds go by. And then, just as suddenly as it began, it ceases. The damage is immense, and many of our resources are taken up simply keeping our hold in one piece. Now, however, a choice now lies before us; this great quake, which split open the core of our hold, has revealed many precious minerals that were previously undiscovered. Due to the unstable nature of the fissures, access to these minerals will likely be short-lived. We could devote effort to harvesting these resources, but this would surely take away from the efforts to rescue and treat survivors."

  diggy.33.d:0 "A vast horde of Black Orcs have ambushed [Root.GetName]! Though we were caught off-guard, our defences are already under operation, despite some initial setbacks. If we are to truly destroy this menace, however, decisive action must be taken in the defence of our hold."

Unfortunately in the course of his research, he deliberately infected himself with the Rot in order to view the results of his work, and though he could slow the disease, he could not halt it. Worse, besides the loss of one of our best minds, he was not able to properly explain his research before his untimely demise. His peers are already trying to decipher his notes."
