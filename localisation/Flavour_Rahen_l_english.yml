 rahen.1.t:0 "The Safety of the Hold"
 rahen.1.d:0 "We have taken refuge in the ancient hold of the Amethyst Dwarves, but we are still under many threats. We should strike a deal with those that live beyond our gates and revive old ties between Rahen and the Dwarovar. That would help keep us safe and establish a good precedent for future relations."
 rahen.1.a:0 "Send a delegation!"

 rahen.2.t:0 "A Deal with the Dwarves"
 rahen.2.d:0 "We heard rumours that a group of dwarves recently moved into the long abandoned hold of Krakazol. This rumour is now confirmed, as a delegation of said dwarves has arrived at our court in [Root.Capital.GetName]. They come bearing gifts of gold and an offer of friendship. This deal of theirs might be very profitable in the long run, but they do ask for our protection and support. Is that something we want to give?"
 rahen.2.a:0 "This will be to both our benefits!"

There are legends that such pairings may produce children, but their truthfulness is dubious and this will surely be a scandal."
 rahen.3.a:0 "We must quickly get rid of them"

 #Raj Events
 rahenraj.1.t:0 "The Raja Has Fallen!"
 rahenraj.1.da:0 "Dhenjinsar has fallen, and with it, the old Raja! Across Rahen, former enemies and allies alike acknowledge us as the new leader of the harimraj. As much as things change, however, things stay the same, Prabhis and Senaptis bicker and squabble, harimari and humans still struggle to get along, and trade still flows upon the Kharunyana, but for once, it is us who sit upon the throne in Dhenjinsar."
 rahenraj.1.db:0 "Dhenjinsar has fallen, and with it the Harimraj! Across the lands of Rahen, former Prabhis and Senaptis now stand as independent states, without the old Raja to tie them down. However, as much as things change, things stay the same, and across Rahen, various Raheni and harimari states are at each other’s throats, once more vying for supremacy over their corner of Rahen. However, with Dhenjinsar in our hands, although we make ourselves a large target, they have no chance of defeating our mighty armies. One thing is for sure however; Rahen will never be the same again."
 rahenraj.1.dc:0 "Dhenijansar has fallen, and with it the old Raja! Through guile and diplomacy, we have used our position as Grand vizier to usurp the throne, and across Rahen former enemies and allies alike acknowledge us as the new leader of the harimraj. As much as things change, however, things stay the same, prabhia and senaptia bicker and squabble, harimari and humans still struggle to get along, and trade still flows upon the Kharunyana, but for once, it is we who sit upon the throne in Dhenijansar."
 rahenraj.1.a:0 "We are the heirs to the Harimraj."
 rahenraj.1.b:0 "An era comes to a close."
 rahenraj.2.t:0 "A Senapti Falls"
 rahenraj.2.d:0 "Though we have most loyally and faithfully served the Raj for many years, our nation simply isn’t what it once was. Over time, we have fulfilled less and less of a role in the Raj, and other Senaptia have begun to take more and more of the stage. As such, the Raj has seen fit to demote our great nation.\n\nWe are no longer Senapti; now we are Prabhi."
 rahenraj.2.a:0 "We have truly fallen from grace"
 rahenraj.4.t:0 "A Potential Senapti"
 rahenraj.4.d:0 "The Harimraj is far from a static thing, and although stability would be preferable, internal conflicts are all too common. It seems, however, that through these conflicts, one of our Prabhia has grown in strength enough to rival the Senaptia, and it may be advantageous to recognise them as such, especially since they request this promotion."
 rahenraj.4.a:0 "Their strength shall be recognised"
 rahenraj.4.b:0 "We have enough Senaptia already!"
 rahenraj.5.t:0 "A Fitting Ruler?"
 rahenraj.5.da:0 "As we are Senapti, one of the main expectations is that our nation is ruled by a harimari. However, it seems that [Root.Monarch.GetName] does not fit the bill. If we were to replace them with a harimari, we would surely face instability, but if we were to keep them in power, we may lose the title of Senapti altogether!"
 rahenraj.5.db:0 "As we are Senapti, one of the main expectations is that our nation is ruled by a human. However, it seems that [Root.Monarch.GetName] does not fit the bill. If we were to replace them with a human, we would surely face instability, but if we were to keep them in power, we may lose the title of Senapti altogether!"
 rahenraj.5.a:0 "We must keep [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 rahenraj.5.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] must go!"
 rahenraj.6.t:0 "A Fitting Heir?"
 rahenraj.6.da:0 "As we are harimari, it is vital to ensure our nation remains ruled by harimari, in order to keep our delicate caste system in place. However, due to a variety of circumstances, it seems that our heir is not one of the glorious harimari. We now face a choice; disinherit them, and put a proper harimari in their stead? Or keep them, and deal with the instability that follows?"
 rahenraj.6.db:0 "As we are the people of Rahen, it is vital to ensure our nation remains ruled by humans, lest we fall under the sway of harimari rule again. However, due to a variety of circumstances, it seems that our heir is a harimari. We now face a choice; disinherit them, and put a proper Raheni in their stead? Or keep them, and deal with the instability that follows?"
 rahenraj.6.a:0 "I don’t see what all this fuss is about"
 rahenraj.6.b:0 "Out with the old, in with the new!"

 rahenraj.9.b:0 "Fuck that guy"
 
 rahenraj.1003.t:0 "[From.GetName] requests a Mandate of the Raj"
 rahenraj.1003.d:0 "A group of emissaries from [From.GetName] have arrived at our court and they have bowed deeply in front of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They request that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] exercise [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power to pronounce a mandate and grant them a boon as a subject of the Raj. The ministers gather among themselves discussing the ramifications of the request, but the final choice falls to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. What does [Root.Monarch.GetName] say?"
 rahenraj.1003.a:0 "Give them what they requested"
 rahenraj.1003.b:0 "We won't grant them this"
 rahenraj.1004.t:0 "The Raja's Response!"

While the current Grand Vizier of [current_vizier.GetName] continues to serve, tradition gives each Raja the right to choose a new vizier upon elevation to the throne if they choose.

In [4411.GetName], a legion of clerks that pay you heed is worth a dozen legions of men.

Unfortunately for [Root.Monarch.GetName], that experience felt very far away today in court.\n\nThe Raja stumbled  -- and the vizier stepped in. The raja waffled, and the vizier made a decision. The Raja forget the relevant details of a few petitions, and it was the vizier who (in honeyed tones) reminded [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. By the day's end, it seemed attendants were ignoring [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s words, waiting for the Vizier to make the call. This is outrageous -- and worrisome, if the trend continues."

 rahenraj.2110.d:0 "The Vizier is supposed to be the Raja's right hand, enforcing [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s will and fulfilling [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] desires. But today, it seems that hand has used its privileged position to take a knife to the body's own guts. Though the pain is political and the blood spilled merely humiliation, today's minor scandal could only have been engineered by the Vizier -- not that the Lotus Court will see it that way."

 rahenraj.2111.d:0 "The second son of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has always been a point of pride, a prodigy in blade and tooth and tactics. Sometimes, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] thinks he could be a young Harimar!\n\nIt seems this scion thinks the same, for today he appeared before [Root.Monarch.GetName], and begged to be admitted to the Lotus Court as a general. Having such a figure take a place of prominence in the armies of [4411.Owner.GetName] would undoubtedly boost our place in court, though it would require the Raja accede to such a request. Instead, he might simply be introduced as a courtier, able to study tactics in the Ministries' libraries and perhaps earn an officer's commission himself. [Root.Monarch.GetName] can almost the future's path stretch out before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looks at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHos] son, still kneeling before him, and knows the path will take [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] progeny..."

Apparently, said son has proven talented with both spear-play and tactical thinking, and the vizier would have him serve our armies. When the man is brought to introduce himself, he does seem promising -- but also undoubtedly loyal to our Vizier, first and foremost.

 rahenraj.2113.d:0 "Among the countless subjects that pay the Raja homage in [4411.GetName] is a small herd of elephants -- part of the Ghavanaaji tribes' historical tribute and cared for as a sign of the Raja's prestige (and occasionally, when there are Reishi around, used for parades or hunting). [Root.Monarch.GetName] has paid them little heed, until [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] encounter today.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] customary stroll through the Lotus Court's outlying gardens, during which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] thinks through all the myriad problems of the Harimraj, was utterly disrupted when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] trod into a large pile of elephant feces. Looking up in disgust and disbelief, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] barely dodged the swing of a massive trunk.\n\nIf this insult was offered by any human to the Harimraj's second-highest figure, they would face immediate execution. But, alas, the law is unclear when it comes to the elephants. Any response would have to go through Raja [4411.Owner.Monarch.GetName]. And if there is no punishment, that'll indicate to the court -- who seemed to learn of the event in an hour -- where the vizier falls in the Raja's esteem."

 rahenraj.2114.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has long admired [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] small herd of elephants, a tribute from the Ghavanaaji and sign of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] prestige. That said, one of the perks of being Raja is that such a possession does not require [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] think of the beasts' care, or feeding, or exercise. Indeed, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] little thinks of them at all -- until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] heard of today's hilarious, scandalous, event.\n\nApparently, the vizier stepped in elephant dung on a walk today, and was almost trunk-slapped by one of the creatures. They are now demanding the execution of the offending elephant, and the trainers who abetted this 'crime'. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] cannot think of the last time [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] so red in anger and embarrassment -- but, as with any act from the Lotus Court, levying a punishment on these great beasts would have repercussions around the Harimraj.\n\nThe Raja here is judge, jury, and (metaphorical) executioner -- what is the sentence?"

And though there are always arguments over the relative prestige of such temples, no one would deny that the great temples at Tianlou stand above the rest -- in height, and depth, and grandeur.\n\n 'Walking with Harimar', the common name for the pilgrimage to visit these temples, is said to restore one's sense of balance, their focus on High Philosophy's teachings, and help them emulate Harimar himself.\n\nThe Raja, after receiving a returning pilgrim, is reminded of how vital such traits are in the role of the vizier, even if it means time away from court. Perhaps the vizier should be 'advised' to take such a pilgrimage?"

 rahenraj.0.d:0 "The court of the Harimraj has been growing more and more powerful and corrupt. At this point, the Raja has little control over the country and his feuding subjects have gone to war with one another trying to consolidate their power. If the court is not heavily reformed, then the Raja faces a continual downward spiral, until it is ultimately overthrown by one of its many power-hungry subjects."
 rahenraj.0.a:0 "We need reform!"

 rahenraj.98.t:0 "The Corruption of the Lotus Court"
 rahenraj.98.d:0 "The one thing constant in Halann is decay. Meat rots, turning grey and putrescent. Flowers wilt, vibrant colours going dull and leaves drooping. Minds erode, memories fading and simple acts becoming out of one's reach.\n\nAnd the Lotus Court, that jewel of Rahen, a place of vast feasts and incredible gardens and all the most brilliant minds of the Ministries working in one place? It is an instituion surpassing most on Halann, and its decay is similarly distinguished.\n\nCorruption that siphons off the wealth of an entire continent. Internal politicking with strategems and tactics that rival any of Jaher's campaigns, all in pursuit of personal power. A veritable legion of administrators who are as short-sighted and petty as the Oracle at Tughayasa is far-seeing.\n\nThese problems have only festered under the rule of Indranayar, and may soon spell the demise of the Harimraj. It will take work rivalling any of Harimar's deeds to restore the Raja's authority, purge the ministries, and repair all that has crumbled in the interim. But if it can be done, and Rahen reforged, the Lotus Court may shine brighter than ever before, and the Harimraj with it."

The abundant corruption in the court and the feeble rule of the Raja are now known to all, and thus the Raja is no longer seen as a legitimate ruler. No one in Rahen really listens to them any more.

And, when they looked to the looming Serpentspine, they feared an unending tide of savage monsters, the stuff of exiled dwarves' tales. The hobgoblins tribes who lived in the foothills were a pest and a nuisance, but merely that. They feared the wrong thing.\n\nThat is obvious as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] surveys the armies assembled before him in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Off to one side lay the Ninyu Kikun, the High Marshal's elite; on the other, the slave state rabble of the Zanyu Kikunin. Standing before him, straight in salute, the Wolf Marshal, the Lion Marshal, the Boar Marshal, their armies behind them.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] holds their eyes for a second, then two then three, before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze moves on, drawn to the massive banners of looted silk, each marshal's subordinate generals accompanied by a standard-bearer.\n\nBeyond that, bodies seem to blur together. But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would see, know the strict organization that governs every body in this vast plain. The Nosuinin, lead by two of the infantry's lieutenant-generals, with six divisions each. Four regiments per division, four banners per regiment, eight bands per banner and three teams per band. Ten soldiers in a team, all of whom hope to one day rise and command one of those grouping themselves.\n\nOn the flanks, the Gikunin cavalry: three worg-riding clans, elite in their respective Commands and given the massive wolves to train and ride. Some say the Worg-Lieutenants and Crested Riders who serve as subordinates here are nigh-bestial themselves, but such voices are few and far between -- their charges tend not to leave survivors.\n\nThis is the Hobgoblin army.

The Hobgoblins are by far the greatest threat to the Oni, if we could temporarly deal with that threat, we could focus on the threats to the south and east and grow strong enough to no longer fear them.

They are a disgrace to our people, cravens and rats that chose to live with disgrace and flee, taking with them their tarnished character and besmirching the name of The Command.
