 U20_dwarves_friend_3_desc:0 "The reclamation of the Middle Dwarovar has led to an influx of wealth in Seghdhir and the trade between the hold and the city on the Suran has never been so great before. We must take advantage from this fact to increase our common wealth and the shared benefits!"

 U20_dwarves_friend_4_desc:0 "The Citrine Dwarves have always been great artisans and their gems have been adorned by the rulers of Bulwar since the first era of the God-Kings. But with our friendship enduring and the Dwarves having expanded to hold a large control of the Dwarovar thanks to our help, they can commission a diadem worthy of our ruler."

 U20_coffee_mission_1_desc:0 "According to many scholars, the coffee name comes from the city of Kufu near Eduz-Vacyn and the tradition of coffee in Bulwar is famous. As our population and notably the Akal consumes large quantities daily we must expand the plantations of Kufu."

 U20_coffee_mission_2_desc:0 "The south of the Gulf of Rahen is known for its coffee, and they often claim that the plant grew first in their mountains, a claim we have as Bulwari always dismissed.

 U20_royal_paradise_title:0 "The Royal Paradise"
 U20_royal_paradise_desc:0 "Sardazar has always been more quiet than the bustling streets of Azka-Sur and many Akals have favored its countryside for their leisure. Our current ruler has taken a liking to the foothils of the Dwarovar that surround the city and has asked for the commission of a Paradise, a walled enclosure for his hunting sessions."

 U20_court_royal_title:0 "A royal court"
 U20_court_royal_desc:0 "As the paradise of Sardazar attracts visitors from all Bulwar and has become the main residence of the Royal family, many in the court have entertained the idea of expanding the hunting grounds to be part of a palatial district that would serve as the new capital of the realm, away from the priests of Azka-Sur."

 U20_audience_hall_title:0 "An audience hall"
 U20_audience_hall_desc:0 "The palace of Sardazar was a wonder to Bulwari standards, but the Akalakuni wanted something more. Soon the idea of adding a wonderful hall of audience that would echo the old Bulwari architecture flourished in the mind of the royal architects. Adorned with gems, gold and the finest timber from Bahar, it would symbolize the complete domination of the King of Kings over Bulwar."

 U20_return_surani_desc:0 "The outskirts of Azka-Sur were gone following the attacks of the Zokka packs but thankfully we have taken back these lands and their former inhabitants went back there.

 U20_erlian_natu_fortress_zokka_title:0 "Honoring Erlian"
 U20_erlian_natu_fortress_zokka_desc:0 "Erlian Surzuir was the last Elf Akal and a hero to the Suranis. His death against Zokka in 1444 is vividly remembered by all and as our control over the Harad oasis strenghtened it seems logical to us to wipe out the memory of the monster by renaming his pityful capital to Azka-Erlian"

 U20_elves_eastern_bulwar_desc:0 "The Elves of the realm of Sareyand have been known for educating many deviants and decadents over the years. Tales from their manors along the Naza have tarnished the cult standing and it seems that they need to be reminded of their duties. The city of Ekulzaglu in the Sad Sur mountains will be reorganized as a great monastery for Sun Elves which will be able to put themselves at work in their sacred duties in the Sad Sur."

 U20_down_the_suran_desc:0 "The akalate of Hašr was the main victim of the Zokka advance.
