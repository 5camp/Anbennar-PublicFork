    G59_hunting_pearls_title:0 "Hunting Pearls"
    G59_hunting_pearls_desc:0 " Anisíkheion was founded by Kherkan pearl hunters as a base of operations. While we have long since moved past those early days, much of our population still partakes in the practice. Recently, our pearl hunters have found signs of significant quantities of pearls off the coast of the islands of Agonisí, Anikhein, and Proylasí. This is a great opportunity to breathe new life into these once quiet isles by investing in infrastructure for our pearl hunters on these islands."
    G59_expanding_fleet_facilities_title:0 "Expanding Fleet Facilities"
    G59_expanding_fleet_facilities_desc:0 "As our control of the seas grows, so too must our fleet. Unfortunately, we do not currently have the infrastructure to support the fleet we need. Our admirals have proposed a massive building project across our territories to remedy this issue. Our engineers have also proposed the construction of a great naval arsenal upon the island of Anisíkheion. The costs may be great, but the results will be worth it."
    G59_inviting_kheionai_diplomats_title:0 "Invite Diplomats"
    G59_inviting_kheionai_diplomats_desc:0 "As our city grows even more than anyone could imagine, we are starting to gain attention from the Alecandi kheions who had for so long overlooked us. Our city is by size alone just as great as theirs, but if we invite their diplomats to our city, it could be shown in beauty as well. Let us invite them to our great city, and let them spread stories of our city’s grandeur upon their return!"
    #2nd Column
    G59_invest_in_our_city_title:0 "Invest In Our City"
    G59_invest_in_our_city_desc:0 "When we were chained to our parent city, Kherka, we never had much room to grow. Our economy was entirely dependent on feeding Kherka, and the only people who moved here were convicts and exiles sent away from Kherka. With us now being independent and free, it is about time we invested our new found surplus wealth into growing our city into one able to rival those of Alecand."
    G59_a_great_kheion_title:0 "A Great Kheion"
    G59_a_great_kheion_desc:0 "Our glorious city has only barely eclipsed those of Alecand, but it still has so much room for further improvement. Our sailors call for improved dockyard infrastructure, more housing needs to be built, and so much more. We shall invest more into our city than ever before, for we should not stop at being merely "equal" to the great kheions!"
    G59_the_greatest_kheion_title:0 "The Greatest Kheion"
    G59_the_greatest_kheion_desc:0 "Even the poorest of Anisíkheion’s residents are as wealthy as the average resident of the other kheions, for we are not just superior in terms of size, but in wealth as well. Even with all our progress, there is still so much potential. We will create the greatest, most beautiful city, the greatest of the Kheionai!"
    G59_develop_the_southern_islands_title:0 "Develop The Home Isles"
    G59_develop_the_southern_islands_desc:0 "While Anisíkheion’s growth and success has made our citizens very wealthy, it has the residents of our other islands envious and resentful. Representatives from these overlooked islands call for investments to be made, so they too can partake in our success."
    G59_kheions_of_the_sea_title:0 "Kheions Of The Sea"
    G59_kheions_of_the_sea_desc:0 "Our recent investments into our island territories have paid off greatly, with these islands hosting new, growing cities with just as much potential as Anisíkheion had. Interestingly enough, these new cities are also host to increasing immigration from Alecand, as a way to escape the increasingly powerful deathwinds. It is time we invest even more into these new cities, for success breeds more success."
    G59_show_them_reality_title:0 "Show Them Reality"
    G59_show_them_reality_desc:0 "The great kheions refuse to see our greatness, and insult our diplomats, considering us mere upstarts. We will not let this stand. Maybe blockading their ports will make them see reality!"
    G59_subjugate_the_great_kheions_title:0 "Subjugate The Great Kheions"
    G59_subjugate_the_great_kheions_desc:0 "It is from the great kheions that our civilization first emerged, and if we want to proclaim ourselves the greatest of the Kheionai, we will have to subjugate these cities. Once we have become their overlords, they will no longer be able to dismiss us, and no one can dare ignore our place in the sun, as the greatest of the Kheionai."
    #3rd Column
    G59_kherkan_overreach_title:0 "Kherkan Overreach"
    G59_kherkan_overreach_desc:0 "For generations, we have sat on our islands, watching our parent city squabble with its neighbors. Kherka never called us into their wars, and never cared much for our existence. For a long time, this was an agreeable arrangement, we kept our autonomy, and in return they defended us and demanded a yearly tribute. Recently, however, the Kherkan state has been trying to gain increasing control over us, in a potential attempt to annex us. We will not let this happen. It’s about time we break free from our parent city, and guarantee our future."
    G59_consolidate_the_southern_cleaved_sea_title:0 "Consolidate The South Sea"
    G59_consolidate_the_southern_cleaved_sea_desc:0 "Our newfound freedom has led to great benefits, but even greater risks. The southern Cleaved Sea is our rightful sea, yet many of its islands are controlled by foreign, potentially hostile powers. Many influential members of our republic, including the admiralty and merchants, want to see the southern Cleaved Sea under our control. Let us seize the south for ourselves!"
    G59_scouting_volthlisi_title:0 "Scouting Vothelisí"
    G59_scouting_volthlisi_desc:0 "In the middle of The Cleaved Sea lies the Vothelisí islands. It is the last remnant of a land bridge that once connected Alecand to the mainland. While this fact is interesting enough on its own, the islands also serve as a barrier, a wall dividing The Cleaved Sea in two. Whoever controls the Vothelisí islands controls the trade through The Cleaved Sea. This fact alone has led to our merchants calling for us to seize the islands. Our admiralty too are supportive of this, fearful of the security implications of these islands falling into the hands of an enemy.\n\nWe shall send scouts to the area to poke at its weaknesses, for potential holes in its defenses. We must be prepared, for the states that hold these islands won’t give them up without a fight."
    G59_extracting_tolls_title:0 "Extracting Tolls"
    G59_extracting_tolls_desc:0 "Our conquest of the Vothelisí islands has already led to great benefits for us. We control The Cleaved Sea, now it’s time to exploit this. We shall build a series of tolls that everyone must pay to sail past these islands."
    G59_expanding_the_admiraltys_authority_title:0 "Expand Naval Authority"
    G59_expanding_the_admiraltys_authority_desc:0 "We do not have total control of The Cleaved Sea yet, for the northern islands still lay outside of our reach for now. What's more of an issue, however, is the amount of smugglers that have risen up to bypass our tolls. These slippery bastards know how to avoid our tolls, or just bribe our officials to get around them. Our admiralty has proposed that they take control of the tolls, and with it the responsibility of stopping any smugglers that may try to get past them."
    G59_all_your_islands_are_belong_to_us_title:0 "All Islands Belong To Us"
    G59_all_your_islands_are_belong_to_us_desc:0 "We shall own all the islands of The Cleaved Sea, for with the islands come total domination of the trade that runs through it!"
    G59_the_admirals_coup_title:0 "The Admiral's Coup"
    G59_the_admirals_coup_desc:0 "Since the independence of our nation, we have been relying on the admiralty to serve as our means of projecting power. We have been focusing on improving our navy, with it becoming a powerful influence within the republic. The citizens themselves have begun to notice the increasing authority of the navy over the nation. But today, the Kylakas in Anisikheion was given a visit by the Grand Admiral, a very prominent figure in the nation by now, and his men..."
    G59_the_great_proclamation_title:0 "The Great Proclamation"
    G59_the_great_proclamation_desc:0 "While many have noticed our greatness and have acknowledged it, it seems the Alecandi have not. Alecandi diplomats seem to dismiss us as island yokels with a massive fleet, somehow uncultured by their standards. It seems we will have to be very direct with them, and so the Grand Admiral has prepared a speech to be delivered in front of a massive crowd in the center of Anisíkheion today…"
    G59_monopolize_the_cleaved_sea_title:0 "Dominating Trade"
    G59_monopolize_the_cleaved_sea_desc:0 "Our position as the unrivaled hegemon of The Cleaved Sea has given us many options when dealing with our enemies. It’s time then, we bring out one of our harsher policies upon them. All merchants will have to be registered with Anisíkheion if they want to sail in our waters. If they aren’t, they will be considered smugglers and their ships will be seized. Not only will this cut off trade to any nation in The Cleaved Sea who dare oppose our rule, it will also give us access to an even greater amount of wealth!"
    G59_the_8th_great_kheion_title:0 "The 8th Great Kheion"
    G59_the_8th_great_kheion_desc:0 "We have come far from our humble origins. We have become great and powerful! Our city: the greatest the Kheionai have ever seen. Our navy: the greatest this side of Aelantir. Our power: unchallenged. Our wealth: unmatched."
    #4th Column
    G59_pirates_to_the_east_title:0 "Pirates To The East"
    G59_pirates_to_the_east_desc:0 "Much of our state’s revenue comes from the toll the merchants traveling through the passage must pay to enter our waters. It was always a stable source of revenue, and could be relied on…And then the corsairs appeared. In hindsight, the southern passage was always vulnerable to piracy, but only now had that threat become realized.\n\nOur scouts report that these pirates operate out of the newly independent kheion of Amgremós, and that they have the unofficial support of the state of Amgremós. Officially, Amgremós denies their collaboration with the corsairs, although we know the truth. We shall send spies into Amgremós in order to gather the evidence needed to prove their collaboration with the pirates. With this evidence, we will have a valid case for war, and no one will try and intervene to stop us from bringing this rogue kheion to justice!"
    G59_expanding_the_fleet_title:0 "Expanding The Fleet"
    G59_expanding_the_fleet_desc:0 "To achieve our goal of dominating the cleaved sea, we will need a fleet bigger that shall always be bigger than those possessed by our enemies. All it takes is one catastrophic lost naval battle to bring Anisíkheion to ruin…We shall build enough ships to make sure this possibility never occurs!"
    G59_growth_of_southern_trading_title:0 "Increased Passage Traffic"
    G59_growth_of_southern_trading_desc:0 "With the closing of the port of Amgremós to the corsairs, the threat of piracy in the passage has been almost wiped out. This has led to a boom in merchant shipping traffic sailing through the passage, something that benefits us directly."
    G59_protecting_the_merchants_title:0 "Protecting The Merchants"
    G59_protecting_the_merchants_desc:0 "The passage is still vulnerable to attacks, even with Amgremós being closed to pirates. Small time raiders, barbarians, and others still on occasion attack merchant shipping along this vital route. We shall build a large escort fleet to protect these merchant vessels, the tolls they pay will more than offset the cost of maintenance."
    G59_the_route_secured_title:0 "The Route Secured"
    G59_the_route_secured_desc:0 "With our escort fleet sailing the entire length of the trade route, we have become known far and wide as the protectors of the merchants. From Orenkoraim to Degakheion, our escort ships are found, keeping the trade route open, free of any potential attack. It is about time, then, that we exploit this influence to secure as much influence for our own merchants as possible."
    G59_our_own_nekheis_title:0 "Our Own Nékheis"
    G59_our_own_nekheis_desc:0 "We were once another nékheis among many, our only distinguishing trait being our island based geography. We have come a long way from that dreadful time, and it is helpful that our cousins see the truth of our greatness far more clearly than the Alecandi do. Our diplomats have presented a proposal to The Grand Admiral, to send an offer to our cousins, offering them our "protection". While the idea of having a nékheis of our own has never really been a goal of Anisíkheion, the other Alecandi have nékheis, and we don’t. It's about time this should be rectified."
    G59_secure_the_coastal_mainland_title:0 "Secure The Devandi Coast"
    G59_secure_the_coastal_mainland_desc:0 "With the acquisition of our own nékheis, we finally have the means to deal with the one threat that has up until now gone untouched: the mainland. Barbarian tribes, bandits, raiders and hostile states occupy the Devandi coast. We shall secure the coastline, offer it to our nékheis to control, and thus the last threat to our hegemony will be dealt with."
    #5th Column
    G59_the_treaty_of_anisoton_title:0 "The Treaty Of Anisóton"
    G59_the_treaty_of_anisoton_desc:0 "The Amgremósi have been defeated. Their harbor has been blockaded for months, their navy is at the bottom of the sea, and their people are starting to starve. They have sent diplomats to us, begging for peace…It’s about time we ended this, peace is more profitable after all."
    G59_islands_to_the_east_title:0 "Islands To The East"
    G59_islands_to_the_east_desc:0 "We have heard from merchants who make many voyages to the east of far away islands, just off the coast of Taychend, untouched by the warlords. While they are owned by Ameion for now, they would serve as perfect naval bases for us. Let us seize these eastern islands, and with them the control of the Taychendi coastline!"
    G59_eastern_bases_title:0 "Eastern Bases"
    G59_eastern_bases_desc:0 "We have seized the eastern islands, and with it, the eastern sea is ours. Among these islands is Genthíliá, the 2nd largest among them. It has a natural harbor, perfect for building a great base of operations in the east…"
