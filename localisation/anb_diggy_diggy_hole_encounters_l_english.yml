 diggy_encounter.1.t:0 "A Good Night’s Sleep"
 diggy_encounter.1.d:0 "The campfire crackles, faint sparks rising through the smoke, warm food, and comfortable blankets. That is what adventurers need to carry on their task, and, luckily, that is what our expedition got last night. Stories were exchanged, songs were sung, and trophies were admired."
 diggy_encounter.1.a:0 "Good Morning!"

 diggy_encounter.2.t:0 "Deserters In the Expedition"
 diggy_encounter.2.d:0 "The expedition leader looked on in confusion as a group of explorers threw their weapons away. “What is this?” he asked before being bombarded by complaints. Reckless dungeoneering, rampant crime, lacking medical support, and more. Those were the complaints brought before the leader as the soldiers went on their own way, leaving him stupefied."
 diggy_encounter.2.a:0 "That’s It, I Quit!"

 diggy_encounter.3.t:0 "Serpentbloom?"
 diggy_encounter.3.d:0 "A small stream of water trickles down into the next cavern. Its walls are filled with a yellow, vaguely luminescent fungus, its shape reminiscent of Serpentbloom. As an adventurer comes closer, a cleric intervenes: “Halt,” he says, “we don’t know if this is dangerous, let me investigate.” After a short time, the cleric returns to the troop. “It is edible,” he declares. Soon the evening meals contain this fungus as a staple, and the troop has stocked up on supplies."
 diggy_encounter.3.a:0 " "You should come try this!" "

 diggy_encounter.10.t:0 "Lost Malfunctionning Golem"
 diggy_encounter.10.d:0 "Around every corner oft the Serpentspine there might be another secret, another adventure, or another relic of its long history. Those relics may be long broken, but sometimes they are just resting. As metal scrapes on stone and faint whining of gears reverberates from the walls, a towering figure appears in front of a forward expedition. An iron golem stands tall, its body ready to fight intruders once again. At least what it thinks are intruders."
 diggy_encounter.10.a:0 "ATTACK -ZRSH- IMMINENT"
 diggy_encounter.10.b:0 "Through its legs, through its legs!"

 diggy_encounter.11.t:0 "Crushed Metal, Broken Gears"
 diggy_encounter.11.d:0 "The golem’s torso crashes to the ground, sending shocks through the surrounding caves. Springs and gears get ejected as its protective shielding fails. A last whisp of steam escapes the broken surface, and the golem is defeated."
 diggy_encounter.11.a:0 "As the old faulters, the new will take its place. Onwards!"

 diggy_encounter.12.t:0 "A Crushing Defeat"
 diggy_encounter.12.d:0 "The expedition engaged the golem in a narrow pathway, but the sundering power with which the golem smashes steel and bones alike soon overwhelms even the sturdiest of adventurers. Shields splinters, weapons broken, the expedition flees from the merciless metallic fists. Even now the stone breaking under their impact echoes through the halls, a haunting reminder of those who lost their lives."
 diggy_encounter.12.a:0 "Things were just built better, back then..."

 diggy_encounter.20.t:0 "Webs on the Walls"
 diggy_encounter.20.d:0 "The first thing the scouts noticed where the nets. Sticky patches of glistening white strings started lining the halls left and right. The strings vibrate when they touch anything, sending waves deep into the dark. There was no denying: A nest of spiders must be near, and big ones, from the look of it. And deep in its heart there might be treasures they have taken there, cocooned into their slippery silk. A small force could retrieve such trinkets and scout ahead, looking for a way through. On the other hand, there is a small crevice that might lead around the whole affair."
 diggy_encounter.20.a:0 "Send out some scouts!"
 diggy_encounter.20.b:0 "Let us not risk unnecessary dangers."

 diggy_encounter.21.t:0 "Trinkets and Baubles"
 diggy_encounter.21.d:0 "As expected, the spiders tucked some gold and gems away from the prying eyes of fortune seekers, but courage prevailed in the face of danger and our scouts returned with troves of treasure. Curiously they saw no trace of the silk-weavers, just empty halls lined with webs."
 diggy_encounter.21.a:0 "It was probably abandoned; it doesn’t matter anymore."

 diggy_encounter.22.t:0 "Curious is the Trapmakers aArt"
 diggy_encounter.22.d:0 "As our scouts return, their number diminished, they report of the horror they saw. There was no need to fear the spiders, their traps were enough already. As a particularly unlucky member stepped on what seemed to be stable ground, the nets hidden by rocks gave way into a crevice, leading to gods-know-where. Others got crushed in avalanches triggered by the unassuming vibrations of small webs, and even more just… stuck to the webs, with no way to cut them down without getting stuck as well."
 diggy_encounter.22.a:0 "His efficacy unwitnessed by his own eyes."

 diggy_encounter.23.t:0 "Eyes In The Dark"
 diggy_encounter.23.d:0 "Darn it, the nest was not abandoned. And what we assumed was a safe way around was the actual trap. As the convoy made its way through the corridor, spiders ambushed them, injected their paralyzing poison, cocooned them, and carried them away, somewhere deep into their nest. Despite this horrific display of cruelty, cold, hard steel can’t be poisoned, and our weapons decimate their number faster than they can abduct us. At the end, we managed to free most of our men, but the eight-legged beasts destroyed some of our supplies."
 diggy_encounter.23.a:0 "We shall never go there again."

 diggy_encounter.30.t:0 "Deep Rothé"
 diggy_encounter.30.d:0 "The Rothé is a curious creature, living both in the light above, and the dark below. They are excellent animals, they are strong, their meat is tender, and their disposition is agreeable. It is therefore no wonder that the Serpentspine once housed many of these beasts. Nowadays most are imported from the surface, but some of them managed to survive on their own. A herd of these are just ahead, their fur long and tangled, their horns spiralling along their heads. They would make an excellent addition to our diet, but who knows what strength they possess if they survived here?"
 diggy_encounter.30.a:0 "Kill them and take their meat!"
 diggy_encounter.30.b:0 "Better leave them alone, those horns look menacing…"

 diggy_encounter.31.t:0 "Victory of the Cleaver"
 diggy_encounter.31.d:0 "The Rothé posed no problem for our weapons. The docile beasts didn’t know what was upon them until it was too late. They were slow and sluggish, fattened by the serpentbloom that grows in these caves. Soon the entire herd lay victim to our cook’s cleaver, so that the expedition may now enjoy a fresh meal again."
 diggy_encounter.31.a:0 "Finally, a break from the hardtack."

 diggy_encounter.32.t:0 "Rage of the Beasts"
 diggy_encounter.32.d:0 "It takes considerable strength to survive this deep in the Serpentspine, and we should have known that from our own experiences. Although the beasts eventually went to the chopping block, they did not leave our numbers unscarred. The raw power of their crushing hooves and piercing horns has felled more than necessary"
 diggy_encounter.32.a:0 "Let us prepare a feast for the fallen."

 diggy_encounter.40.t:0 "Pitch Black Darkness"
 diggy_encounter.40.d:0 "The caverns deep in the Serpentspine are usually lined with luminescent plants, fungi, and other sources of ambient light, but there are some parts where no light pierces the darkness, places of eternal gloom, where some of the most dangerous monsters house. As the expedition enters one of these dark stretches, a grue, a terrifying monstrosity of the dark, attacks."
 diggy_encounter.40.a:0 "Hold the line!"

 diggy_encounter.41.t:0 "Banish the Darkness!"
 diggy_encounter.41.d:0 "With sword and spears the grue was driven into the light, where it lost most of its shadowy advantage, sending it into a blind rage, thrashing and wailing at the expedition. This opened the way for a coordinated attack, killing the beast."
 diggy_encounter.41.a:0 "Quick, somebody light a torch!"

 diggy_encounter.42.t:0 "Unseen Horror"
 diggy_encounter.42.d:0 "One by one, one by one, the monstrosity picks out the soldiers. Muffled screams from the darkness allude to the horrific being stalking us. One by one our numbers diminish, until far too many have been lost. “If we run back now, all will be for naught,” the expedition leader exclaims, but not a second later he was taken in by the grue, sending the expedition fleeing. Only a few return from the darkness into the safe light, so many have been lost in the darkness"
 diggy_encounter.42.a:0 "Please, somebody save us!"

 diggy_encounter.50.t:0 "Floak of Cloakers"
 diggy_encounter.50.d:0 "While exploring the caverns and crevices of the Serpentspine it is not uncommon for the groups to disperse from time to time, leaving stragglers behind. At the end of the day, they usually join with the main group again and that’s that. Usually. While counting our numbers the quartermaster noticed that some people have not joined with the group again. “Get out there and find them,” he commands, but the troops soon return, legs in their hands, running away from soft sailing shadows above them. “CLOAKERS!” one shouts, before being picked up by one of these nightmarish creatures. "
 diggy_encounter.50.a:0 " “Archers! Take Aim!” "

 diggy_encounter.51.t:0 "The Aberrations Disperse in the Darkness"
 diggy_encounter.51.d:0 "As soon as our archers and gunners took aim and started bombarding the cloakers with arrows and lead they quickly dispersed. “They are known for picking up stragglers and people left behind on battlefields,” a seasoned adventurer recalls, “not for direct attacks. We must have scared them away.”"
 diggy_encounter.51.a:0 "A trifling victory, but a victory nonetheless"

 diggy_encounter.52.t:0 "A Loss of Supplies"
 diggy_encounter.52.d:0 "As soon as our archers and gunners took aim and started bombarding the cloakers with arrows and lead they quickly dispersed. “They are known for picking up stragglers and people left behind on battlefields,” a seasoned adventurer recalls, “not for direct attacks. We must have scared them away.” He pauses and looks around. “Not without stealing some of our supplies, it seems,” he adds."
 diggy_encounter.52.a:0 "Damn those creatures!"

 diggy_encounter.53.t:0 "The Belly of the Beast"
 diggy_encounter.53.d:0 "As soon as our archers and gunners took aim and started bombarding the cloakers with arrows and lead they quickly dispersed. “They are known for picking up stragglers and people left behind on battlefields,” a seasoned adventurer recalls, “not for direct attacks. We must have scared them away.” There is silence before a moment. “Well, onwards then!” another exclaims. “Chase them, let us find where they stash all of their loot!” Soon the expedition descends on the cloakers with vigour, slaying every last one of them. In the centre of their hideout waited a pile of treasure for the taking."
 diggy_encounter.53.a:0 "A worthwhile endeavour. "

 diggy_encounter.54.t:0 "The Terror in the Lightless Dark"
 diggy_encounter.54.d:0 "Darkness overtook us, the winged beasts blotted out every source light. Haunting moans mingled with terrified screams as the cloakers descended upon us. They flew silent like owls, the knowledge that they are there more terrifying than their actual presence. No one dared lighting a torch until much later. How long had the cloakers left us already? It is hard to say. A look around tells the story of the attack: Many bodies, bitten to death, and huge losses in our supplies."
 diggy_encounter.54.a:0 "We must consolidate what we still have."

 diggy_encounter.60.t:0 "Drums in the Deep"
 diggy_encounter.60.d:0 "Bellowing screams and drum-like pounding echo through the winding hallways, sure signs that there are cave trolls nearby. Despite their sluggish movements and stupid grimaces, they do know how to kill. We have been cornered into a cave with no other exit and the stomping of feat draws ever nearer to us."
 diggy_encounter.60.a:0 "Bar the doors, ready the weapons!"

 diggy_encounter.61.t:0 "Victory!"
 diggy_encounter.61.d:0 "As a sword plunges through the last living troll the expedition rejoices. Around them lie the misshaped bodies of dozens of cave trolls, their skin slit open, sculls bashed. No drums can be heard anymore, safety has returned to these halls. For now."
 diggy_encounter.61.a:0 "Death to the giantkin!"

 diggy_encounter.62.t:0 "Beaten Against the Walls"
 diggy_encounter.62.d:0 "A cleric takes a sorrowful step across the battlefield riddled with corpses. The trolls stand out like boulders, surrounded by the remains of many of our adventurers. “A tragedy,” she exclaims. “Let us honour those who protected us and mourn their sacrifice.” All who are left agree in silence, averting their eyes from the carnage surrounding them. At least the drums have stopped."
 diggy_encounter.62.a:0 "Silence surrounds us"

 diggy_encounter.63.t:0 "Troll Hoard Ahead"
 diggy_encounter.63.d:0 "“Onward! Their treasure must be stowed away around here,” a particularly ambitious explorer shouts and rouses the fortune seekers. They build a rag-tag group of scavengers scouring the surrounding halls for troll hoard. They find it eventually and bring back an impressive haul of gold, gems, ancient art, and mystical weaponry."
 diggy_encounter.63.a:0 "Trinkets and baubles, paid for in blood"

 diggy_encounter.70.t:0 "Collapsing Cave!"
 diggy_encounter.70.d:0 "Faint dust trickled down from the cave’s ceiling, building small piles like stalactites. Upon further inspection the rocky pillars securing the roof appear to have cracks that run deep into the stone. A debate sparks whether this cave should be traversed or not, but it was already too late. The ceiling gave way to the pressure building up, sending an avalanche of rocks and boulders down towards the expedition, killing and entombing many members within moments."
 diggy_encounter.70.a:0 " "I told you so!" "

 diggy_encounter.80.t:0 "Great Mushrooms"
 diggy_encounter.80.d:0 "A great cavern opens up in front of the expedition leader, small streams of water trickling down the natural stairs carved out by long past tectonic activity. After a few steps down the water converges to a lake, surrounded by greater-than-life mushrooms. Their stalks glow violet and the caps extrude a dizzying smell, but not necessarily in a bad way. At their feet are more colonies with smaller mushrooms with up many different colours."
 diggy_encounter.80.a:0 "Take them with us, we need the food."
 diggy_encounter.80.b:0 "Better leave them be, who knows what those are."

 diggy_encounter.81.t:0 "Edible Mushrooms"
 diggy_encounter.81.d:0 "Among the samples the expedition took were many edible, and, quite frankly, delicious specimen. A small group went back to get some more, and the cooks are thankful for the variety they brought to the dreary diet."
 diggy_encounter.81.a:0 "Great!"

 diggy_encounter.82.t:0 "Violet Fever"
 diggy_encounter.82.d:0 "The cook stirred up a meal with great excitement: They had finally gotten a new ingredient to try out for the evening meal. At first it seemed fine, but soon the poison took hold of the expedition. A raging sickness, quickly called the Violet Fever, due to the ugly discoloration of the skin and bulging pustules, swept through the adventurers. Few of the infected survived, but still suffer from the damage the poison wrought."
 diggy_encounter.82.a:0 "Bring me the head of the cook responsible!"

 diggy_encounter.83.t:0 "Toxic Spores"
 diggy_encounter.83.d:0 "Despite our tries to leave the mushrooms alone, their caps shook, releasing toxic spores that stuck to the adventurers, causing rashes and ugly necrosis. Even days later the infected were battling with the strange sickness before finally succumbing to it."
 diggy_encounter.83.a:0 "We should barricade the cave."

 diggy_encounter.90.t:0 "Hobgoblin Raiders"
 diggy_encounter.90.d:0 "A forward scout hastily returns to the expedition leader: He tells of a group of heavily armoured, red-skinned humanoids traversing the caves ahead. The leader recognizes the threat immediately: Hobgoblins. There is only one way to make them understand that they are unwanted, and that is a show of force."
 diggy_encounter.90.a:0 "To arms!"
 diggy_encounter.90.b:0 "Wait, why not see if we can cooperate?"

 diggy_encounter.91.t:0 "A Costly Victory"
 diggy_encounter.91.d:0 "Clashing steel, thundering guns, whirring bows, those are the signs of battle, and what a battle it was! After hours of skirmishes, clashing lines and warfare we finally emerged victorious, the hobgoblins slain, red blood on red skin soaking the ground, but next to them lie many of our adventurers as well."
 diggy_encounter.91.a:0 "But a victory nonetheless."

 diggy_encounter.92.t:0 "A Costly Defeat"
 diggy_encounter.92.d:0 "Hobgoblin discipline is truly something to behold. Despite hours of skirmishes, clashing steel and all out battle their line never broke, a daunting wall of well armoured intruders. Then, suddenly, they made their advance, plunging into our faltering lines and smashing them. In our retreat we lost many men and even more supplies."
 diggy_encounter.92.a:0 "We must consolidate what we still have, then press on."

 diggy_encounter.93.t:0 "A Crushing Victory"
 diggy_encounter.93.d:0 "Hobgoblins are trained to fight on the open fields of Rahen, or maybe even the dwarovrod, but their tactics are useless in the labyrinthine crevices of the Serpentspine. Through repeated skirmishes we decimated their number easily with minimal losses, claiming their supplies and loot for our expedition."
 diggy_encounter.93.a:0 "Take that, you stealing intruders!"

 diggy_encounter.94.t:0 "A Crushing Defeat"
 diggy_encounter.94.d:0 "It was a useless idea trying to engage the hobgoblins from the front. Their disciplined lines hold out, their archers and gunners mowed through our troops like a war wizard, utterly defeating us. Our losses are innumerable, our weapons and spirit broken. Counting the few survivors as they try their best to tend to their wounds is a grim task. Too many lives have been sacrificed for nothing."
 diggy_encounter.94.a:0 "What now…"

 diggy_encounter.100.t:0 "They Are Above Us!"
 diggy_encounter.100.d:0 "The expedition enters a wide cavern full of stalactites, walls shimmering with strange minerals. Distracted by the unique beauty they notice too late that there are no stalagmites under their hanging counterpart. The piercers, larval ropers, descend from the ceiling like vultures, impaling the unsuspecting expedition. "
 diggy_encounter.100.a:0 "Kill them! Kill them all!"

 diggy_encounter.101.t:0 "Pierced The Enemy"
 diggy_encounter.101.d:0 "Our spears make quick process of the lurking larvae, impaling them before they can do much more damage to our troops. Soldiers stab around them with enough awareness to not hit their fellow explorers, trying to hit as many slithering creatures as possible. The frenzy comes to a close when the last piercers slither away and flee."
 diggy_encounter.101.a:0 "Good job!"

 diggy_encounter.102.t:0 "Pierced and Piercing"
 diggy_encounter.102.d:0 "A general frenzy breaks out as the piercers descend and impale our troops. It seems like an even match; the expedition only gains the upper hand at a late stage of the battle. As the last larvae slither away the expedition leader surveys the losses. He shakes his head. “This was an avoidable incident,” he thinks to himself."
 diggy_encounter.102.a:0 "Open your eyes next time!"

 diggy_encounter.110.t:0 "Wandering Husks"
 diggy_encounter.110.d:0 "Many terrors stalk the caverns of the serpent spine, but none are so apathetic to their own dangerousness as wandering husks laden with poison. Each step, they exude wafts of poisonous gas, dispersing it into the thick air around. A group of these has crossed paths with our expedition. It seems there is no way to get rid of them, fighting would stir them up even more, resulting in too many casualties."
 diggy_encounter.110.a:0 "Try to avoid them at all costs!"
 diggy_encounter.110.b:0 "Approach and handle with care and extract what poison you can."

 diggy_encounter.111.t:0 "Deadly Explosion"
 diggy_encounter.111.d:0 "Not only is the gas poisonous, is also easily flammable as we had to find out. A single, carelessly dropped torch rolling towards one of the husks was enough to cause a great explosion, triggering even more husks to explode. The shockwave and subsequent inferno luckily caused more injuries than casualties, but not all were so lucky."
 diggy_encounter.111.a:0 "I said, "Avoid them!" "

 diggy_encounter.112.t:0 "Poisonous Explosion"
 diggy_encounter.112.d:0 "Husks like these are naturally volatile, prone to self-combustion, releasing their toxic innards into their surroundings in a great explosion. This triggered a chain reaction, filling the cave with noxious gasses. The expedition made haste to escape the gas, but some were infected and would ultimately succumb to the sickness, as well as some of our supplies that have become inedible."
 diggy_encounter.112.a:0 "A cleric! A kingdom for a cleric!"

 diggy_encounter.120.t:0 "The Tunnelling Menace"
 diggy_encounter.120.d:0 "The last few days had been easy travel through long circular hallways connecting the caverns with each other, making climbing equipment redundant for some time, a welcome change to the hostile geography of this particular stretch of the Serpentspine. But it wouldn’t be long that the source of these tunnels was discovered. It announced itself through rumbling thunder, the sound of crushed rock and constant rasping. From the solid rock burst forth a beast like few others, a mighty purple worm, a gigantic cave dweller and ravenous hunter. It flashed its sharp teeth and dark maw before approaching the expedition with hungry intent."
 diggy_encounter.120.a:0 "Mount the defences! Everyone to arms!"

 diggy_encounter.121.t:0 "A Well-Fought Victory"
 diggy_encounter.121.d:0 "Killing a purple worm is no easy feat. Many explorers are torn apart by its teeth, crushed under its gigantic body, or simply flailed away by its erratic movement, but not us. We held out against the monstrosity, bombarding it with all we had, spells, arrows, lead, spears, swords, everything we could weaponize in any way. Now, after an arduous battle, the worm twitches as it dies, its body riddled with our weapons. As the dust settles the first soldiers come to the body and try to make something of the accomplishment"
 diggy_encounter.121.a:0 "This is worth a great celebration!"
 diggy_encounter.121.b:0 "Cut it up, give it to the butchers, meat is back on the menu!"

 diggy_encounter.122.t:0 "An Insurmountable Foe"
 diggy_encounter.122.d:0 "Purple worms are a menace like few others in the Serpentspine. Its erratic movements send soldiers flying against the cavern walls, its teeth tear apart our troops and even more get crushed by the weight under the gigantic monstrosity. In the end we can simply count our losses as the worm makes its way back into the stone, tunnelling away to raze some other part of the caverns."
 diggy_encounter.122.a:0 "At least it won’t return for now…"

 diggy_encounter.130.t:0 "Drunkards in the Expedition"
 diggy_encounter.130.d:0 "A scandal has happened! Multiple explorers have lost all decorum and gotten stone-cold drunk, parading through the expedition camp, singing songs so out of tune that they ought to have their mouths clamped shut. But that would just address the symptoms, not the underlying problem. We must do something about this, or we will have an army of drunkards instead of a well-organized group of explorers."
 diggy_encounter.130.a:0 "Make an example of those drunk soldier and execute them"
 diggy_encounter.130.b:0 "No more alcohol for everyone"

 diggy_encounter.140.t:0 "Dwarven Explorers"
 diggy_encounter.140.d:0 "The Serpentspine is the ancestral home of all dwarves, so it stands o reason that there would be dwarves roaming even the caverns, searching for traces of their venerated ancestors. Such a party of adventurers is now before us, just around the corner. We can’t have other competitors here, so we must address this at once."
 diggy_encounter.140.a:0 "The orcs knew what to do! Hand me my axe!"
 diggy_encounter.140.b:0 "What great company! Let us search as one!"

 diggy_encounter.141.t:0 "A Display of Power"
 diggy_encounter.141.d:0 "The dwarves never suspected anything. The expedition startled them and cut them down, spilling some more dwarven blood in the Serpentspine. Their time is over, it’s on us to establish dominance here."
 diggy_encounter.141.a:0 "We dwarfed them!"

 diggy_encounter.142.t:0 "Stone Cunning"
 diggy_encounter.142.d:0 "“Never fight a dwarf in their hold, nor their roads. No matter what you know about the terrain, they know it ten times better,” a great leader once said. Even far away from their holds and roads these dwarves are in their natural element. Like unwavering stone, they held against the attack and then unleashed an avalanche of rocks upon us. They quickly took from us what they could carry and went their merry way, singing songs in their guttural language."
 diggy_encounter.142.a:0 "To the hells with those bearded bastards!"

 diggy_encounter.150.t:0 "An Apparition Appears"
 diggy_encounter.150.d:0 "A creaky, rattling voice echoes through the cave as ghastly spirits appear in front of the expedition. Restless dwarven spirits, damned to spend their existence in unlife. The question remains: What are we to do?"
 diggy_encounter.150.a:0 "They died before, let’s see if we can kill them again!"
 diggy_encounter.150.b:0 "Our ancestors! They will surely know where we can find some loot!"

 diggy_encounter.151.t:0 "Silence in the Caves"
 diggy_encounter.151.d:0 "As we approach the dwarves they stare on in silence, their eery, empty eyes fixated on us. A cold breeze of air hushes through the cave, creating a whining sound, startling the explorers. They dare not take a step further."
 diggy_encounter.151.a:0 "Cowards! But maybe that is for the better…"

 diggy_encounter.152.t:0 "Ghasts!"
 diggy_encounter.152.d:0 "The ghosts whirl around, hovering towards us with ill intent, their faces contorting into strange and frightening grimaces. The first ranks are stupefied in horror as the spirits draw closer. Others start running away from the ghastly appearances. Even our most steadfast soul can’t escape a feeling of horror."
 diggy_encounter.152.a:0 "Run! This devilry is none of our business"
 
 diggy_encounter.170.t:0 "A Dry Track"
 diggy_encounter.170.d:0 "As the expedition continued down through the rocky cavern they grew more and more frustrated. Treasures had been scarce for some time now, and many adventurers started to argue whether they should head back and take another path. But as the dry run continued, a seasoned sage of the Serpentspine remarks on the strange traces on the rock. “I suspect,” he says, “that we might come upon a group of flail snails soon. That would explain the recent lack of loot, as these sluggish creatures consume all valuables that cross their paths. Excellent trackers if we fancy following them. Their shells are worth quite a bit of crowns as well, if we wish to strike them down.”"
 diggy_encounter.170.a:0 "You said these things are worth money? Attack them!"
 diggy_encounter.170.b:0 "Treasure is what we search. Follow them!"

 diggy_encounter.171.t:0 "Flayed Snails"
 diggy_encounter.171.d:0 "There was no way these slow creatures could have escaped our expedition. The soldiers quickly drew closer, cutting and slashing their flails, leaving the creatures to die in their shells. The terrible wailing from the dying snails echoed through the cavern, but when it finally subsided the shells were easy to remove without much further damage."
 diggy_encounter.171.a:0 "Excellent"

 diggy_encounter.172.t:0 "All that for nothing?"
 diggy_encounter.172.d:0 "Even though the snails had no way to escape us, they took some form of revenge on us: In the brunt of battle most shells have been damaged beyond repair, rendering them and their antimagical properties unusable."
 diggy_encounter.172.a:0 "Such is life"

 diggy_encounter.173.t:0 "Wall of Veins"
 diggy_encounter.173.d:0 "As the expedition followed the snails they started noticing a rich ore vein running through the wall almost perpendicular, like a great river set in stone. Deposits which our miners can make good use of, once they clear the mineral of the sticky slime left behind."
 diggy_encounter.173.a:0 "Useful creatures"

 diggy_encounter.174.t:0 "The Track Runs Dry"
 diggy_encounter.174.d:0 "Moans of frustration echo through the chambers as the expedition follows the snails. “We're not finding anything and are slow,” one member complains. His words fall on eager ears and soon most explorers start complaining to the expedition leader, to the point where there is no other choice but to retrace their steps and search a different cavern for the treasure they came for."
 diggy_encounter.174.a:0 "Oh well, we tried."

 diggy_encounter.175.t:0 "Glittering Orbs Within the Walls"
 diggy_encounter.175.d:0 "At long last the snails have led us to a great deposit of crystals and gems, gleaming from within the walls. The expedition quickly removed the snails from the deposit and marked the location, such that our miners can start extracting the shining riches of the Serpentspine."
 diggy_encounter.175.a:0 "Useful creatures"

 diggy_encounter.180.t:0 "Eye in the Dark"
 diggy_encounter.180.d:0 "Over the past few sunless days seep in the Dwarovar a strange, gleaming eye has followed us. A seasoned bestiarist has identified the strange creature to be a Nothic, a mage whose search for the arcane has led them to a terrible curse that reduces them to nothing but a shadow, a husk of their former selves. Now a guard, an explorer, and a mage stand before the expedition leader to debate what should be done with it."
 diggy_encounter.180.a:0 "Dispose of it, lest it attacks us from the dark"
 diggy_encounter.180.b:0 "Leave the wretch alone"
 diggy_encounter.180.c:0 "It knows of secrets, you say?"

 diggy_encounter.181.t:0 "Strong minds, frail bodies"
 diggy_encounter.181.d:0 "The curse placed upon a Nothic reduces them to a frail condition, a fogged mind in a frail body. No wonder, then, that our men have killed it with ease. But despite its physical form falling to our blades, its strange gloom has haunted the nightmares of some explorers since the day it was slain."
 diggy_encounter.181.a:0 "Curses!"

 diggy_encounter.182.t:0 "Rotting Flesh"
 diggy_encounter.182.d:0 "As our soldiers corner the Nothic its eye inflicts upon them a terrible fate: Their flesh is stripped from their bones and left to rot and decay. Screams of horror echo through the halls as they disperse and flee from the accursed creature. Some we could save from death as the creatures gaze only strafed them, but those who were fully engulfed by its gaze were not so lucky."
 diggy_encounter.182.a:0 "Ashen Skies, to the pits with these mages and their curses

 diggy_encounter.183.t:0 "No Secrets To Be Gained"
 diggy_encounter.183.d:0 "The Nothic continues to stalk our expedition for some time and it still haunts the sleepless nights of some of our men. The first night when the eye was not seen at all was a tenuous, straining watch, filled with gruesome thoughts of where the creature might be hiding now. As the days pass, however, we concluded that it was not in hiding, but left us, whether it has learned our secrets, or just lost interest no one can say."
 diggy_encounter.183.a:0 "Finally, our dreams will be ours again"

 diggy_encounter.184.t:0 "Dreams of an Eye"
 diggy_encounter.184.d:0 "Has the creature left us? It is hard to say whether its physical form is still among us, but in our dreams its eye glitters and gleams with a taunting glint that startles even the most experienced adventurers awake and sends a shiver over their back. They ramble on about the Black Door, the Apotheosis of Worms, and most concerning of all, they seem to recall events from the future, predicting our demise in gruesome detail."
 diggy_encounter.184.a:0 "Sometimes an active imagination can be a bad thing"

 diggy_encounter.185.t:0 "An End to the Curse?"
 diggy_encounter.185.d:0 "The Nothic's ragged voice scratches as it explains what it searched for: A way to undo the curse that has been placed on it. To that end it has discovered an artifact that stems from the precursors, or so it claims, at least. True or not, it asks us to bring it to our mages so that they may study it and maybe find a remedy to its curse-stricken life."
 diggy_encounter.185.a:0 "Let's try to help"
 diggy_encounter.185.b:0 "I don't trust it."

 diggy_encounter.186.t:0 "Estate Collaboration"
 diggy_encounter.186.d:0 " A young mage from within our ranks accepts the artifact and begins its study, exited and eager to learn its secrets. After some days of experiments he has exclaimed to have made a breakthrough discovery, but he now lacks the laboratory to continue his studies. Once he returns, says he, our mages will be eager and willing to take up this research as well, sparking cooperation with their estate."
 diggy_encounter.186.a:0 "And this, my friends, is why we bring mages along"

 diggy_encounter.187.t:0 "The Curse Upon Us"
 diggy_encounter.187.d:0 " A young mage from within our ranks accepts the artifact and begins its study, exited and eager to learn its secrets. The next day, however, he was found dead in his tent, his flesh stripped from the bones in a macabre display of arcane power. Our mages back home will not be pleased with our report on his demise."
 diggy_encounter.187.a:0 "Curses upon curses!"

 diggy_encounter.210.t:0 "Lone Xorn"
 diggy_encounter.210.d:0 "Strange sounds echo through the caverns, sounds of breaking stone and minerals hit against each other, like a mill crushing them to pieces. As the first scouts rounded the corner, they could see that their first guess was not as far off the truth as expected. There, sitting among a small deposit of minerals, sat a xorn, a hideous scaled creature not of this world, shovelling rocks inside its wide maw with the three arms surrounding it. The scouts return with their observations, so that the expedition leader can decide how to approach this outsider: Seize its meal, or make use of their nature to shift through stone as easily as fish swim through water?"
 diggy_encounter.210.a:0 "Kill it and get the minerals!"
 diggy_encounter.210.b:0 "Maybe we can convince it to scout for us using its ability to shift through the earth"

 diggy_encounter.211.t:0 "The Last Meal"
 diggy_encounter.211.d:0 "A xorn's skin is hard to penetrate, and its evasiveness by shifting through stones makes each hit difficult, but with every blow we land we do make progress. After a tedious battle with, luckily, not too many losses, we have managed to defeat the creature, but the meagre reward it had left behind was not worth the effort."
 diggy_encounter.211.a:0 "We squandered time and resources"

 diggy_encounter.212.t:0 "Despair"
 diggy_encounter.212.d:0 "Despite our knowledge of these tunnels, xorn come from a world full of stones, and they know quite well how to weaponize their surroundings, as well as their ability to shift through stones. Periodically ducking away from our weapons, vanishing into the floor just to re-emerge and pick our soldiers off, one by one. Soon the ranks give in and break up, sending the soldiers into a frenzied retreat."
 diggy_encounter.212.a:0 "Run away!"

 diggy_encounter.213.t:0 "Eyes in the Tunnels"
 diggy_encounter.213.d:0 "Thanks to a seasoned adventurer capable of speaking the xorn's strange language, he could persuade the creature to help us out by scouting the area in exchange for a portion of the minerals we find."
 diggy_encounter.213.a:0 "This should help greatly"

 diggy_encounter.214.t:0 "Rejected"
 diggy_encounter.214.d:0 "Whether it was a simple misunderstanding or genuine rejection, the xorn did not accept our offer. Apparently, the adventurer claiming to speak its outlandish language has upset the creature in some way, it walks away but not without stealing one of our own bags that was filled with minerals…"
 diggy_encounter.214.a:0 "What a waste of time"

 diggy_encounter.220.t:0 "Reclaimers"
 diggy_encounter.220.d:0 "Aul-Dwarov. All-Dwarves-Home. The Serpentspine was home to the greatest dwarven nation Halann has ever seen, and maybe will ever see. Although the empire has long faded to antiquity, remnants of eons past stir, and now the empty roads and caverns are repopulated once again. It is no wonder then, that the dwarves themselves would try to return to their ancestral holds. One of these groups, a small group of colonizers, has crossed our paths. They are laden with supplies, everything one needs to survive in the dim caverns of the Serpentine."
 diggy_encounter.220.a:0 "Kill them and take what they have!"
 diggy_encounter.220.b:0 "Perhaps they're willing to trade?"
 diggy_encounter.220.c:0 "Come join us!"

 diggy_encounter.221.t:0 "Taking from the Dead"
 diggy_encounter.221.d:0 "The dwarves had their chance ages ago, now these colonizers will fall, too. Swift steel sliced their throats, and what they had is now ours."
 diggy_encounter.221.a:0 "Onwards! The Serpentspine is ours!"

 diggy_encounter.222.t:0 "Defiant Dwarves"
 diggy_encounter.222.d:0 "It takes considerable power to stay alive in the Serpentspine, and even after centuries of defeats, the fact that dwarves still roam the Serpentspine is a testament to their endurance. Endurance, which now comes crashing over our expedition. These are hardy dwarves, bent on reclamation and no easy prey."
 diggy_encounter.222.a:0 "Run away!"

 diggy_encounter.223.t:0 "An Exchange of Goods"
 diggy_encounter.223.d:0 "The dwarves welcome us into their fold and show us what wares they've got. An impressive accumulation of all an adventurer could ask for: Food, drink, and weapons aplenty, all for sale."
 diggy_encounter.223.a:0 "Could we sample some of that serpentbloom?"
 diggy_encounter.223.b:0 "Steel and guns, that's what we need."

 diggy_encounter.224.t:0 "Covered Coffers"
 diggy_encounter.224.d:0 " “We need everything ourselves,” their leader says. “We've come so far; I'm not willing to endanger this mission.” Our expedition leader nods. “I understand,” he says. “May you find save passage then.” He recalls our explorers to the camp, with no new supplies to show for our expedition."
 diggy_encounter.224.a:0 "It is understandable"

 diggy_encounter.225.t:0 "Stout Fellows"
 diggy_encounter.225.d:0 "”Well that settles the deal,” our expedition leader says. “You join our cause, and we join yours. Together the Serpentspine will be ours for the taking!” The cooks quickly prepare a meal for the short festivities that will ensue. After food and drink have been dispensed, their leader comes to ours. “What now? What would you have us do?”"
 diggy_encounter.225.a:0 "Help us delve deeper!"
 diggy_encounter.225.b:0 "You can go back to the hold."
 expedition_dwarf_colonists_reward:0 "The Dwarf colonists settle in our §YHold§!"

 diggy_encounter.226.t:0 "Solitary Settlers"
 diggy_encounter.226.d:0 "Dwarves are narrow minded people, so it is to no one's surprise that they rejected our offer. As we part ways we wish them good luck on their endeavour, but we carry on our own way."
 diggy_encounter.226.a:0 "A squandered chance"

 diggy_encounter.260.t:0 "Orc Skeletons"
 diggy_encounter.260.d:0 "As our scout climbs through a crevice a narrow path opens before them. The hallway is riddled with orc skeletons, as far as the eye can pierce the darkness, a gruelling display of savagery. Their bones bear the marks of weapons, skulls cracked, and limbs broken in twain."
 diggy_encounter.260.a:0 "Let's see if they have some loot"
 diggy_encounter.260.b:0 "This might be the work of Gerin! Look for three broken swords near a wall, it's where he hides the loot!"

 diggy_encounter.261.t:0 "Coins Beneath the Bones"
 diggy_encounter.261.d:0 "As was to be expected, barely anything was left at the site, most likely cleared out long before our arrival. Some coins still hid under the bones, but nothing valuable was recovered that day."
 diggy_encounter.261.a:0 "It's something at least"

 diggy_encounter.262.t:0 "Barren Bones"
 diggy_encounter.262.d:0 "The entire mausoleum has been cleared, not a single coin, gem or piece of jewellery left on the bones. There is nothing for us here."
 diggy_encounter.262.a:0 "Oh well"
 diggy_encounter.262.b:0 "At least something killed these orcs"

 diggy_encounter.263.t:0 "Hidden in the Wall"
 diggy_encounter.263.d:0 ""Here! Here! The sign of Gerin Orcrend!" a scout yells out to the expedition. He has indeed found the sign we've been looking for, three broken swords balanced against the wall. Shovels were quickly brought of the site, unearthing valuables and weapons of orcish artifice, baubles and other treasures, an impressive haul beyond anything we had thought of finding here."
 diggy_encounter.263.a:0 "Good job"

 diggy_encounter.270.t:0 "Rolling Death"
 diggy_encounter.270.d:0 "While the expedition continues scouting out the caverns, somewhere deep within the dark a thunderous rumbling can be heard, its reverberations echoing through the ground. Splitting and cracking stone herald its arrival: A huge boulder has dislodged deep within the cavern and is headed right for our expedition, an avalanche of smaller stones just behind it."
 diggy_encounter.270.a:0 "RUN! RUN AWAY!"
 diggy_encounter.270.b:0 "Hide away, quickly now!"

 diggy_encounter.271.t:0 "Barely Escaped"
 diggy_encounter.271.d:0 "As the last echoes of the rolling death subsided the explorers and scouts look around. The expedition has scattered. With the sound of a horn, they slowly gather around again, some carrying bodies of our fellow adventurers with them their bodies disfigured by the avalanche."
 diggy_encounter.271.a:0 "These are the dangers one has to contend with"

 diggy_encounter.272.t:0 "Painful Death"
 diggy_encounter.272.d:0 "The rumbling stone luckily overpowers the cracking bones of our expedition. The rolling death had arrived so fast that only few managed to escape its thundering path. As the expedition leader looks around, they count many dead, and even more injured. A disaster."
 diggy_encounter.272.a:0 "The very caves conspired against us "

 diggy_encounter.273.t:0 "Caves and Crevices"
 diggy_encounter.273.d:0 "The caverns of the Serpentspine give ample space for crevices and other small pathways where the tumbling rocks cannot reach that it was no problem for our expedition to dodge the rolling death. The explorers quickly dispersed into the many holes and overhangs and emerge afterwards, unscathed by the avalanche."
 diggy_encounter.273.a:0 "It's about size, not how you use it"

 diggy_encounter.280.t:0 "Shimmermere"
 diggy_encounter.280.d:0 "Glittering in the faint bioluminescence of the cavern walls lies a pool of clear, calm water, it's surface like a mirror. Soon the first soldiers arrive at the shore, their water skins ready to be refilled."
 diggy_encounter.280.a:0 "Refill our water supplies"
 diggy_encounter.280.b:0 "Wait! Stop that, we don't know what's up with this"

 diggy_encounter.281.t:0 "Reinvigorated"
 diggy_encounter.281.d:0 "The cold water coats our throats and inspires us to go further, press onwards, uncover the secrets that await our prying eyes and ears."
 diggy_encounter.281.a:0 "Water gives life"

 diggy_encounter.282.t:0 "A Pool of Death"
 diggy_encounter.282.d:0 "The water is cold and fresh, and the soldiers drink quickly. When the first one starts coughing nobody expected anything. When the second on began silent looks were exchanged, but then the third and fourth were coughing up blood, and they started falling over, their bodies soon as cold and lifeless as the water that killed them."
 diggy_encounter.282.a:0 "Curses upon curses!"

 diggy_encounter.290.t:0 "Friendly Mushrooms"
 diggy_encounter.290.d:0 "While we were picking some mushrooms a group of mushroom people appeared"
 diggy_encounter.290.a:0 "More food!"
 diggy_encounter.290.b:0 "Aww they're adorable"

 diggy_encounter.291.t:0 "Food but at what cost?"
 diggy_encounter.291.d:0 "The little mushroom people are dead. We've gained more supplies but our men feel like true monsters"
 diggy_encounter.291.a:0 "I can't believe we did that"

 diggy_encounter.292.t:0 "Little Death"
 diggy_encounter.292.d:0 "Sensing our unprovoked violent attack, the mushroom people call for backup and proceed to pummle whatever body part they can reach"
 diggy_encounter.292.a:0 "No! Not there!"

 diggy_encounter.293.t:0 "Happiness"
 diggy_encounter.293.d:0 "Some of our men couldn't resist giving the little mushroom people some pats. They seem to not mind and maybe even like it and so everyone in the expedition joined in"
 diggy_encounter.293.a:0 "These are too cute"

 diggy_encounter.294.t:0 "Sadness"
 diggy_encounter.294.d:0 "Some of our men attempted to touch some of the mushroom people. They recoiled and ran away making our men feel horrible that they scared them"
 diggy_encounter.294.a:0 "We just wanted some friends"
