 #Missions
 OWB_a_brave_old_world_title: "A Brave Old World"
 OWB_a_brave_old_world_desc: "The first moments of awakening from our ancient slumber were equal parts dramatic and terrible; the sudden dissolution of our mystic dreams was like ice-cold water over skin.\n\nThe deeper disruption, however, lies in the slow contemplation of all the many changes that this world must have undergone during our long absence..."
 OWB_waking_the_others_title: "Waking The Others"
 OWB_waking_the_others_desc: "We debated for long hours over the ethics of awakening our kin from the total joy and peace that only artificial reality can bring. Is it not a terrible crime to force them to be like us, tormented as we are by the phantoms of the past? It is. Nevertheless, we will need them to put those phantoms to rest."
 OWB_establish_the_rehabilitation_council_title: "The Rehabilitation Council"
 OWB_establish_the_rehabilitation_council_desc: "The constructs tasked with maintaining the vault facility have been broken down by the long march of time, and this old shelter of ours has seen better days. Nevertheless, it is perhaps the only active reminder of what our people once were. To maintain, protect, and expand it is thus nothing less than a sacred duty."
 OWB_study_center_title: "Study Center"
 OWB_study_center_desc: "Advanced civilization brings many benefits, but it has a curse: the system is vulnerable to the loss of specialized knowledge. Reclaiming that long-dead wisdom by studying the artifacts of our people must be a top priority."
 OWB_securing_the_vault_title: "Securing The Vault"
 OWB_securing_the_vault_desc: "It is difficult to believe that the wild creatures who make their homes atop our graveyards could be a threat, but they are many, and we are few. The region around the vault must be pacified to safeguard the last bastion of hope."
 OWB_further_expansion_title: "Further Expansion"
 OWB_further_expansion_desc: "As we see more of what has become of this world, it is clear that the primitives are somewhat more advanced than initially believed, having organized themselves into permanent settlements. This is delightful news -- it should make them far easier to subdue."
 OWB_securing_water_title: "Securing Water"
 OWB_securing_water_desc: "Not even all our great wisdom can restrain the physical constraints of life. A secure water supply is necessary, and it seems that our old surveys of the region have become outdated after the cataclysm. A new expedition must be sent to map our water source in the mountains above."
 OWB_our_legacy_title: "Our Legacy"
 OWB_our_legacy_desc: "Oh, how the world has suffered in these long years! Each day of our absence has diminished it. Once it was adorned by the jewels of our cities; now, it is the home of little more than ruins and playacting savages. It is our destiny to reclaim this land and restore its natural order."
 OWB_forward_base_title: "Forward Base"
 OWB_forward_base_desc: "It would be extremely unwise to reveal the existence of the vault, but dealing with the surface world will nevertheless require a base of operations. We should secure an area for a forward position that can serve as the nexus for our resettlement efforts."
 OWB_surface_harbour_title: "Surface Harbour"
 OWB_surface_harbour_desc: "We cannot reclaim the land without living upon it, and so we must build for ourselves a capital on the surface."
 OWB_conscripting_the_natives_title: "Conscripting The Natives"
 OWB_conscripting_the_natives_desc: "Our continued observation of the natives has raised difficult questions. Fighting them will only waste the lives of our precious brethren, and each soul lost is like another ember of the old world dying out. Instead, we will offer a deal: those who fight for us will no longer have to live their tragic, solitary lives; instead, they may live as subjects of an advanced and benevolent race."
 OWB_damestear_reactor_title: "Damestear Reactor"
 OWB_damestear_reactor_desc: "The Dame's Heart was a powerful reactor even when it was made, let alone the nearly-incalculable power it represents in this new world. It will take time, but with effort and ingenuity it should be possible to restore it to a functional state."
 OWB_ancient_technologies_title: "Ancient Technologies"
 OWB_ancient_technologies_desc: "With the restoration of crucial vault infrastructure nearly complete, it should now be possible to return the rest of our buildings and facilities to operation. Even this small fraction of our former power should be enough to carry out our mission."
 OWB_ruling_the_waves_title: "Ruling the Waves"
 OWB_ruling_the_waves_desc: "We must understand things from the perspective of those who surround us: they do not really comprehend the gap between our people and theirs. The first thing they see when our fleet arrives should be something that clearly drives that point home."
 OWB_restoring_order_title: "Restoring Order"
 OWB_restoring_order_desc: "It is sad to watch the chaos and bloodshed which rules our primitive neighbors, but it is no surprise. They are locked in a bitter game of survival and lack the refined virtue of their ancestors -- and even that virtue did us little good, in the end. It is our duty to give them guidance and direction and save them from this path."
 OWB_an_elven_step_title: "An Elven Step"
 OWB_an_elven_step_desc: "Some say that the progress we have made in reclaiming our homeland is but the first step on a long journey. They are right, but it is the long stride of an elven step: elegant, graceful, deliberate. It may take time for all of our former domain to fall under our sway, but it shall be done with exacting perfection."
 OWB_splendid_vault_title: "A Splendid Vault"
 OWB_splendid_vault_desc: "It has taken both genius and the strained exertions of all that remains of the elven people, but our vault has finally been properly restored. Even were those long-dead to see this place, they would not think it beneath them -- indeed, it is the only place in all the world that truly honors what we were."
 OWB_our_story_title: "Our Story"
 OWB_our_story_desc: "Our story is one of a people grown accustomed to decadence and power, whose many capabilities were only overmatched by their own hubris. But we will not let that be the end of the story. Let this be a story of a people who saw a better way forward, who overcame their tribulations, and who were reborn to be even greater than they once were."
 OWB_fate_of_the_losts_title: "Fate of the Lost"
 OWB_fate_of_the_losts_desc: "How could our initial judgement of the Lost have been so cruel? In each of them is the seed of life spawned by our own kind all those many years ago. It is true that they are not like us, and managing their bestial nature will be a governance challenge -- but doing so with compassion is of utmost importance."
 OWB_speak_softly_title: "Speak Softly"
 OWB_speak_softly_desc: "We are no terrifying horde emerging from underground to claim the world around us through fire and war. It is imperative that our neighbors see us for who we are: beneficent elders who are more than happy to treat with them."
 OWB_carry_a_big_stick_title: "Carry A Big Stick"
 OWB_carry_a_big_stick_desc: "Of course, elders are due respect and obeisance. Those who cannot restrain themselves from insolence must still be disciplined."
 OWB_of_peace_title: "Of Peace"
 OWB_of_peace_desc: "What tales will be told of these days, when the world's rightful masters stepped out from beneath the ground to reclaim their home? We must hope that they are tales of an era of peace and serenity, an era into which one would be lucky to be born."
 OWB_of_conquest_title: "Of Conquest"
 OWB_of_conquest_desc: "Our people must earn their story's happy ending. The bear may rest without disruption because it has impressed upon the other denizens of the forest that it has no reason to fear them. Similarly, the path toward peace can only be paved by the projection of absolute dominance."
 OWB_of_war_title: "Of War"
 OWB_of_war_desc: "We know the cost of war far, far better than all those who dwell this world today -- it tore down the greatest people in all of history, after all. To shy away from it on this account, however, would only doom what remains of our story to be one of feeble cowardice."
 OWB_the_last_chapters_title: "The Last Chapters"
 OWB_the_last_chapters_desc: "There is a sadness in knowing that the vitality and significance of the early days of our reclamation are coming to an end. When our descendants tell this story, they will no doubt end it before coming to the long, slow work of rebuilding that now awaits us. Let us be sure to give them a satisfying climax to this era of our history."
 OWB_land_of_peace_title: "Land Of Peace"
 OWB_land_of_peace_desc: "It was division and strife which bred the day they now know as the Day of Ashen Skies. We stand as the sentinels against those forces, guarding this world and in so doing creating the space for all its people to live in peace."
 OWB_under_one_rule_title: "Under One Rule"
 OWB_under_one_rule_desc: "Finally, we control all which rightfully belongs to us. It may not yet be the glorious state of old, but at least we are whole again."
 OWB_mother_of_war_title: "Mother Of War"
 OWB_mother_of_war_desc: "There is a simple way to ensure tranquility: ensure the general understanding that cooperation is the only rational choice. We create such a state of affairs by crafting weapons so powerful that their mere existence makes potential foes fear even the thought of standing against us. And nothing shall yield this task better than Mathcogh."
 OWB_old_world_blue_title: "Old World Blues"
 OWB_old_world_blue_desc: "There were so few of us left when we stepped out of the vault, leaving behind the beautiful, saccharine dream of artificial reality. Even so, our grand accomplishment, the total subjugation of our homeland, has finally met with total success. Let this be tale of revival be yet one more monument to the greatness of elven kind."
 
 #Events
 owb.1.t: "The Awakening"
 owb.1.d: "The Precursor Elves were no fools. They sensibly began to worry about the end of the world as soon as they had the capability to end it themselves. While the specific events of the Day of Ashen Skies could not have been predicted by any ordinary means, anyone paying attention to the pace of magical advancement would have been aware that a great tragedy lurked at the tail end of possiblity.\n\nAnd so a plan was hatched: facilities would be created, buried deep within the earth, which might sustain a number of individuals through any conceivable apocalypse short of the general collapse of reality. Magical constructs would staff and maintain these facilities, while magical wards and shields would guard the structure against both the calamity itself as well as the passage of time. The plan at first received immense support, but political squabbles and other distractions ended up sapping the program of its vitality shortly after it created its first, and only, fully-functional vault.\n\nVault 8 was powered by the Dame's Heart, an immense magical reactor designed to ensure the longevity of the systems therein. In order to sustain its inhabitants through what might be a long period of awaiting the return of habitability, the vault was outfitted with sleeping pods which could send its inhabitants into a magically-induced slumber of blissful, artificial dreams which would preserve both the mind and body. When the Day of Ashen Skies came for the old world, a lucky few were able to escape to safety within the confines of Vault 8's shielded walls. Everything worked perfectly -- except the system that was supposed to wake them up when surface conditions calmed. Only now, nearly fifteen hundred years later, have some residents been awakened by the degradation of their sleeping pods."
 owb.1.a: "AI Only, player will never see this"
 owb.1.b: "We must make up for lost time!"

 owb.2.t: "Expanding The Vault"
 owb.2.d: "Expanding the vault is certainly possible, but it is an undertaking of considerable effort. Given how few of us yet remain, we must carefully balance the scales between the effort spent on this ancient facility and the reclamation of our homeland on the surface above."
 owb.2.a: "It is time for expansion"
 owb.2.b: "Perhaps this is not the best time"

 owb.3.t: "Vault Upgraded"
 owb.3.d: "After enormous effort and the expenditure of many resources, the vault facility has been expanded from its previous size. We have maintained the essential geometric perfection of the vault, retaining its capacity to channel vast magical energies and power our ancient technologies."
 owb.3.a: "Built to last!"

 owb.4.t: "Precursor Artifact in [From.GetName]"
 owb.4.d: "Our surveying expeditions are constantly on the lookout for the now-ancient artifacts of our time, most of which have long since faded into unrecognizable disrepair. Fortunately, in [From.GetName] we have found an artifact that remains reasonably intact. It should be possible to infer pieces of our missing knowledge through careful study of the object."
 owb.4.a: "And so may the old be born anew"

 owb.5.t: "Improving a Vault Wing"
 owb.5.d: "As the intention of the vault was to facilitate not just our protection, but also our eventual resettlement, it came equipped with a number of specialized wings we might find useful in the course of our project to restore the homeland. Unfortunately, these wings had all fallen into disrepair well before our awakening. If we focus our efforts on just one of the wings, we might be able to bring it back online and restore its functionality."
 owb.5.a: "Cloning Vat"
 owb.5.b: "Ore Replicator"
 owb.5.c: "Magical Sensor Array"
 owb.5.e: "Magical Intelligence"
 owb.5.f: "Magical Protector Array"
 owb.5.g: "Go Back"

 owb.6.t: "Vault Wing Improved"
 owb.6.d: "The dedication and intricate work of our mages and craftsmen has repaired the missing and ruined components of one of our vault wings, restoring it to a state of proper functionality."
 owb.6.a: "Excellent news!"

 owb.7.t: "Upgrading our Military"
 owb.7.d: "The derelict ruins that are all which now remains of our empire still hold many useful secrets to which only we hold the keys. The inhabitants of this new, duller world simply do not have the cognitive framework with which to understand that which lies before them -- but to us, the secrets of these artifacts give way like butter before a hot knife. A dedicated research program can systematically uncover those secrets which will aid us in developing a particular element of our military."
 owb.7.a: "Upgrade our Magi-Power Armour"
 owb.7.b: "Upgrade our Sentinel Cannon"
 owb.7.c: "Outfit the Levies"
 owb.7.e: "Go Back"

 owb.8.t: "Military Upgraded!"
 owb.8.d: "Today we have taken yet another step toward asserting our total dominance over this world by upgrading our military forces with newly-restored pieces of our ancient technolgy. Let those who have come after us know who we are by our works, both the great and the terrible!"
 owb.8.a: "Wonderful!"

 owb.9.t: "The Rehabilitation Council"
 owb.9.d: "Restoring a facility like this will require not just intelligence, strength, and endurance, but also the virtue and character necessary to motivate all others to assist in the task. Fortunately, the makeup of the vault was chosen quite deliberately, and some of the greatest elves to ever live are now here to take the reins."
 owb.9.a: "May they guide us well!"

 owb.10.t: "Study Center"
 owb.10.d: "The upper levels of the vault, which once contained sleeping pods, have now been given over to the pursuit, study, and restoration of ancient relics. Those few of us who remain do not possess all the knowledge of the old world -- not even close. With the constructs to maintain and preserve the vault facility, we did not even prioritize learning about all the systems in our own vault. While this is an inconvenience, we have no shortage of brilliance and talent. Those best suited to the task have been assigned to the new study center to fill in that missing knowledge piece by piece, artifact by artifact."
 owb.10.a: "We shall be all that we once were"
 owb_we_can_find_apa_tooltip: "We will be able to find §HAncient Precursor Artifacts§! by §YOccupying§!, §YColonizing§!, §YConquering§!, or §YSubjugating§! countries and provinces."

 owb.11.t: "Expedition to Lake Taspasu"
 owb.11.d: "The surviving surveys of this region were incomplete even when they were up-to-date. With all that has happened since they were performed, the expedition anticipated finding the unexpected when they were sent into the mountains to investigate the water supply -- however, the initial stages of the journey turned out to be fairly straightforward and in line with existing documentation.\n\nThis all changed when, following a stream leading from the lake down the mountainside, the expedition came across a particularly strange cave formation. Initial reports indicate that these cave formations are concealing a rich, untouched deposit of Damestear. Some expedition members reportedly wept for joy at the sight, for they knew right away that the find represented the potential for great workings of magic, and what could be more precious to an elf out of time?"
 owb.11.a: "This calls for celebration!"

 owb.12.t: "Our Legacy"
 owb.12.d: "Our friends and families are long-dead, their bones turning to dust even as this new world takes shape atop their graves. Still, they have left posterity a vast collection of relics that prove their great works to those who care to look. It seems that the people of this age have long looked at the artifacts of our old empire with nothing short of awe and reverence. Such an attitude is appropriate, of course, but it proves the vast distance between them and true understanding of what they see. Indeed, more than once have we discovered primitive chieftains proudly displaying an object we recognize as a mundane household item.\n\nTo us, these are not works of art or heralds of times in the distant past, whose existence is primarily ornamentation and catalyzing contemplation. No, to us, they are practical tools with comprehensible meanings, something which immensely increases their value."
 owb.12.a: "A flourishing market!"

 owb.13.t: "Old World Blues"
 owb.13.d: "All the old world, once the home of elvenkind, now once again swears fealty to her proper masters. Our flag, now known to the Lost as 'the Blue Banner', bears our ancient symbol of progress and unity to the four corners of the old empire. Though sundered, it should be possible to restore this land to its former glory.\n\nThere is one way, however, in which we may still surpass our forebears. They never achieved true dominion over all the world, and that ancient empire never claimed true dominion over the lands across the ocean. This is one achievement we may call truly our own, one more deed to put on the list of elven glories."
 owb.13.a: "All beings deserve our benevolent rule"

 owb.14.t: "War Never Changes"
 owb.14.d: "A child who is badly burned by fire may choose to shun it forevermore, staying as far away from any open flames as they can. To them, this seems like the rational course of action, but in truth they only make themselves weaker and dependent upon others. Likewise, we should not shy away from our people's greatest weapons simply because we have been burned once. Why should we surrender a capability so great when it will make our objectives so much easier to accomplish? It would be a cruel sacrifice of our own people in bloody wars to choose a long and drawn-out contest when we know we have the capability to destroy any nation that stands against us with a power they can hardly even fathom. Let them think their gods have come for them -- in a sense, we have."
 owb.14.a: "We wield Death, the Destroyer of Worlds!"

 owb.15.t: "Upgrading our Army"
 owb.15.d: "Our long periods of study and contemplation have begun to pay off. With some small effort, we can now begin to outfit our military with our newest constructions, made with ever-increasing knowledge of the weapons of the past. It seems the gap between our forces and those of the primitives will only continue to widen."
 owb.15.a: "As it should be"
 
 owb.16.t: "Mathcogh, the Mother of War"
 owb.16.d: "Once again, war has come to our door. And it is our duty to make sure it stay here."
 owb.16.a: "Go Back"
 owb.16.b: "Target [country_1.GetName]"
 owb.16.c: "Target [country_2.GetName]"
 owb.16.e: "Target [country_3.GetName]"
 owb.16.f: "Target [country_4.GetName]"
 owb.16.g: "Target [country_5.GetName]"
 owb.16.h: "Target [country_6.GetName]"

 owb.17.t: "The Last Chapters"
 owb.17.d: "After decades of slowly rebuilding and reclaiming our Homeland, it's now time to work toward ending this chapter of our story."
 owb.17.a: "The End of Our Story"

 owb.1000.t: "you shouldn't see this"
 owb.1000.d: "you shouldn't see this"
 owb.1000.a: "you shouldn't see this"
 
 #Gov Reform
 owb_the_overseer: "The Overseer"
 owb_the_overseer_desc: "The Overseer is a position created during the earliest days of our awakening, managing and organizing life inside the vault now that the constructs failed to perform their duties. The role has evolved over time to take on greater responsibility, and one could now fairly call the Overseer the guardian and benefactor of all the true elves who yet remain on this world."
 mechanic_cant_culture_convert_province_yes: "We can not §RCulture Convert§! provinces. Doing so will §YRevert§! them to their §YOriginal Culture§!."
 mechanic_cant_culture_convert_province: "Can not culture convert provinces"
 owb_carving_the_land: "Carving The Land"
 owb_carving_the_land_desc: "We were the first to claim this land. What better justification could there be for conquest than merely reclaiming that which has always been ours? Every settlement that exists on the world we once called home dwells in the shadow of our achievements. They have not tamed this land as we once did -- instead, they eke out meager existences on the edge of survival. No impartial judge would dispute our claim."
 mechanic_conquer_all_claim_yes: "§GUnlock a special §YPeace Option§! allowing us to conquer all of our §YClaims§! in one peace deal.§!"
 mechanic_conquer_all_claim: "Conquer All Claims"
 owb_rehabilitation_council: "Rehabilitation Council"
 owb_rehabilitation_council_desc: "As our progress continued on the surface, it was determined that a dedicated committee must be created whose sole focus would be on restoring and rehabilitating the vault facility itself. As a result, the Rehabilitation Council was created from among the brightest and most talented of our band of survivors."
 mechanic_can_expand_vault_yes: "§GAllow the §YExpansion§! and §YRehabilitation§! of the §HPrecursor Vault§!.§!"
 mechanic_can_expand_vault: "Can Expand Vault"
 owb_skillfull_leaders: "Skillful Leaders"
 owb_skillfull_leaders_desc: "Those of us who still remain were selected for the privilege based on a variety of factors, with the primary focus being on merit and the capacity for contributing to the resettlement effort. That spirit has carried on, and our relentless focus on giving power to the worthy has only further elevated the best of an already exceptional group."


 #Decisions
 vault_dig_title: "§HExpand the Vault§!"
 vault_dig_desc: "The vault's modular, interlocking design patterns allow for easy expansion. Perhaps the engineers of ancient days did not foresee our circumstances, but by combining their wisdom with the hard work and ingenuity of those of us who remain, we should be able to expand the livable space within the facility."
 vault_wing_title: "§HExpand Vault Wings§!"
 vault_wing_desc: "The vault's ancient wings lie dormant and unused, but their capabilities would be of great use to us. We should investigate restoring some of them."
 vault_military_title: "§HImprove Military Equipment§!"
 vault_military_desc: "Though basic military equipment was part of the vault's supplies, a true reconquest will require iterative development on more advanced models and the production of new armaments that are closer to the cutting edge of the old empire's equipment."
 mathcog_title:  "§HMathcog, The Mother of War§!"
 mathcog_desc: "TODO"

 #Units
 precursor_poweramour_mk1: "Magi-Power Armor: Alfare"
 precursor_poweramour_mk1DESCR: "The basic model of Magi-Power Armor that was left to us in the vault. It is surely a wonder to the primitives who walk this world in this age, but all who inhabit the vault have seen armor far greater."
 precursor_poweramour_mk2: "Magi-Power Armor: Esta"
 precursor_poweramour_mk2DESCR: "Our early rediscoveries in the areas of portable magic and self-sustaining material enhancements have led to a new model of Magi-Power Armor that is more durable while also allowing the wearer to make better use of the armor's physical enhancements."
 precursor_poweramour_mk3: "Magi-Power Armor: Omera"
 precursor_poweramour_mk3DESCR: "Embedded weapons systems connected to the wearer's mind with simple magical links allow this model of Magi-Power armor to field a surprisingly versatile array of armaments, with a tool for almost any combat situation."
 precursor_poweramour_mk4: "Magi-Power Armor: Gimma"
 precursor_poweramour_mk4DESCR: "This model of Magi-Power Armor uses temporal distortion magic to provide the wearer with greatly enhanced speed. This turns the earlier models' greatest weakness -- their lack of maneuverability -- into a point of strength."
 precursor_poweramour_mk5: "Magi-Power Armor: Atire"
 precursor_poweramour_mk5DESCR: "Atire-class Magi-Power Armor makes use of mass modulation magic to become either lighter or heavier as required by the wearer. The momentum of a speedy charge can arrive with incredible force by making the armor heavy, while retreats and skirmishing are more effective with lighter armor."
 precursor_poweramour_mk6: "Magi-Power Armor: Zyrko"
 precursor_poweramour_mk6DESCR: "The Zyrko model of Magi-Power Armor represents the pinnacle of our technological sophistication. The wearer becomes like a god on the battlefield, capable of single-handedly defeating entire squads of enemy infantry and superior to any normal organism in every conceivable way."
 
 precursor_precursor_levee_1: "Native Levy"
 precursor_precursor_levee_1DESCR: "The natives make up a cheaply-outfitted force that forms the bulk of our army's mass. Best suited to holding ground and capturing settlements, they are far from exceptional in open battle."
 precursor_precursor_levee_2: "Native Conscript"
 precursor_precursor_levee_2DESCR: "As our military forces have become more professionalized in the course of the conquest, our process of raising native levies has been augmented by outfitting them with standardized equipment."
 precursor_precursor_levee_3: "Native Trainee"
 precursor_precursor_levee_3DESCR: "Our attempts to further professionalize our force have led us to begin the practice of guiding our native soldiers through the old empire's basic military drills, which should allow greater tactical flexibility in our infantry formations."
 precursor_precursor_levee_4: "Native Soldier"
 precursor_precursor_levee_4DESCR: "Our native levies have come far from the early days of a rag-tag army of primitives. They now seem a proper infantry force, with glory and discipline befitting their station as our descendants."
 precursor_precursor_levee_5: "Native Veteran"
 precursor_precursor_levee_5DESCR: "Our reconquest has taken us through many battles, and the unique dynamics of the post-reclamation battlefield have slowly become clear. Rather than being beholden to ancient elven military doctrine, we have adapted to changing circumstances and built a force designed to create openings for the more devastating Magi-Power Armor and cannon regiments."
 precursor_precursor_levee_6: "Native Elite"
 precursor_precursor_levee_6DESCR: "Our infantry is perhaps the greatest this world has known in fifteen hundred years. Advanced knowledge in social dynamics, military theory, and systems engineering has crafted a force that, even besides its advantage in equipment, is simply far more like a highly competent ancient military than one of these lowlier imitations."
 
 precursor_sentinel_canon_1: "Sentinel Cannon: Clash"
 precursor_sentinel_canon_1DESCR: "A number of bulky Sentinel Cannons were left in the vault, set aside primarily to be used in blasting through wreckage and ruins. They can still serve this function by turning on the walls of enemy settlements, but clever commanders can also find uses for them on the battlefield."
 precursor_sentinel_canon_2: "Sentinel Cannon: Skirmish"
 precursor_sentinel_canon_2DESCR: "The first step to improving our existing Sentinel Cannon models was to enhance the maneuverability. As a result, we have maintained similar firepower while reducing the overall mass of the cannon, allowing it to be deployed and redeployed more quickly while also being more accurate and easier to use."
 precursor_sentinel_canon_3: "Sentinel Cannon: Frontline"
 precursor_sentinel_canon_3DESCR: "The greatest feature of the cannons of old was their rapid rate of fire, a suppressing barrage designed to pin enemy forces in place while the broader army gained positional advantage. With new systems for quick reloading and improved material durability, we can now achieve something similar with our own cannons."
 precursor_sentinel_canon_4: "Sentinel Cannon: Battlefield"
 precursor_sentinel_canon_4DESCR: "This new model of Sentinel Cannon makes any tightly-packed formation essentially suicidal thanks to the greatly-increased blast radius of our new munitions. The mere presence of these cannons on the battlefield makes it nearly impossible for our enemy to engage in the tactics they have grown accustomed to."
 precursor_sentinel_canon_5: "Sentinel Cannon: War"
 precursor_sentinel_canon_5DESCR: "With further increased speed and maneuverability, our cannons can race across the front, crushing not just one enemy formation but several. When properly supported, they provide the enemy with no option but to flee."
 precursor_sentinel_canon_6: "Sentinel Cannon: No Elf's Land"
 precursor_sentinel_canon_6DESCR: "Outfitting our Sentinel Cannons with rapid-fire, long-range gunnery platforms makes the cannon more difficult to approach and gives the crew a tool with which to clean up the stragglers who remain after each blast."
