 beggaston_A_2_desc:0 "We are not the only band to make their way to Aelantir: far from it. Amidst the tide of newcomers, our closest and most problematic neighbors are a company of Half-Orcs that strangely enough worship Dookan as a god of mercenaries, claiming his divinity alongside Corin who slew Dookanson. They have come to ply their bloody trade, likely to the highest bidder, and we are likely their first targets. With territorial tensions already rising, to secure the future of our company and our good works we must bring them into our circle."

And it is true: the more experienced soldiers and adventurers fought against us in the revolt, leaving us disorganized and drained of combat expertise. So let us make an offer to the mercenary captains: they will be given military command over our militias, and may use whatever methods they see fit to train them. It will be a harsh and bruised road to transform peasants with pitchforks into professional soldiers, but it must be done."

Our maps have taken us this far, but from here forward we must find our own direction. With covered wagons in tow, this Shining Circle continues to travel in search of a place to settle down, and to do that we need to know the lay of the land."

 beggaston_C_2_title:0 "Filling in the Circle"
 beggaston_C_2_desc:0 "Our scouts have found a favorable place for a settlement: a patch of prairie with good soil, owed to the river that flows through it and into a large nearby lake. Now, the true labor may begin. There are wagons to be unloaded, ditches to be dug, and the first homesteads to be built.\n\nThe Shining Circle originally attracted its many members in Damescrown with the promise of opportunity, something that stirred the hearts of many an Ara-worshipping merchant. But others too joined en masse: the downtrodden and dispossessed, the peasants and poormen. All Begga's own people, electrified by the passionate call of the halfling priestess and leader of our company, Matilda Silverlocks. While Ara is the goddess of wealth, Begga is the goddess of charity - and so an unresolved tension remains at the heart of the circle. It remains to be seen which camp will determine our future in Aelantir. Regardless, we must report our success back to Damescrown as we lay down the foundations for prosperity."

No matter what the true intent of our expedition was, its future is now the commoners' to shape. Let a new town rise. Begga's town."

 beggaston_C_5_title:0 "A Greater Town"
 beggaston_C_5_desc:0 "The newly named city of Beggaston has already far outgrown the ruins it emerged from, and it grows greater still. A council of equals among farmers, clergy, and craftsmen have overseen the development of the nascent republic's political infrastructure, engaging the citizenry and holding public meetings where anyone may contribute or raise concerns. Merchants and adventurer captains, our former enemies during the Beggan revolt, have found that the only way to make their voices heard is to participate in these proceedings. Through this, they have become invested in the future of the republic, slowly healing the wounds of the revolt."

 beggaston_C_7_title:0 "The Last Lord of Sarda"
 beggaston_C_7_desc:0 "Sarda has been made one under the Beggan lord of Selocshana. The Sardan nobility resisted fiercely but independently, unable to set aside their rivalries to unite against us. Indeed, some nobles spotted opportunity and instead turned to support Selocshana, perhaps with the belief that this was not as radical a change to the Ynn as it seemed. The rest of the embittered nobles remain in their estates, and the loyalty of the peasants are generally divided - the lord of Selocshana has indeed united the entirety of Sarda, but with Cannorian support and in the service of their goddess. Still, none can question who sits upon the throne of Sarda. A throne that the lord of Selocshana has agreed to piously abdicate and keep forever vacant, transferring authority to local advisory councils whose growth we will foster."

 beggaston_C_8_title:0 "Land Reforms"
 beggaston_C_8_desc:0 "The abuses and injustices of Ynnic feudalism stem from one simple economic fact: the peasantry do not own the land they till. Tithes and rents are taken from them to enrich the noble class, empowering lords to levy armies and expand their dominions. The Beggastonic republic will pass new land reform laws that will directly transfer ownership of farmlands to the farmhands that have cultivated them for generations, severing and seizing noble estates. Will the remaining nobility protest? Of course, but disunited as they are, their outrage is of no concern."

 beggaston_C_10_desc:0 "Originally, Beggastonic administrators had planned to use the facilities of the Teal Keep and the city of Arverynn. The Teal Plot and its aftermath dashed all those plans. After deliberations, a new city was selected: Adbraseloc, a small lordship that sits directly between Sarda, Dolindha, and the Expanse. Though long derided as a backwater, its central location in bridging these three regions makes it perfect for overseeing administrative needs in our nation. The wounds of the Teal Plot are still fresh, and the relative unimportance of Adbraseloc means that few would care what we do with it. In fact, we have found allies in the city: the Vodynnar, a group of progressives that promote reforming Ynnic society by integrating Cannorian ideals. Local bureaucratic talent is also present in the Adbraseloc gatekeepers, who oversee the tolling of merchants and travellers. In all, it has become clear to us that this is the true center of the Ynn."

Many of them have congregated in Dhathemar on their own, for the isolated lake there makes for a convenient scrying tool and a local herb has been discovered that kindles well as magical incense. We'll offer support to the mages to break them out of their shells: let us build a tower at the lakeside and begin the mass cultivation of the herb in Dhathemar, transforming the province into a center for their organization. In exchange, they will perform acts of "folk-wizardry" and render magical aid to withering crops and sick countrymen."
