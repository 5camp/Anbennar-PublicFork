# Event chain 1
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 verkaldromak.1.t:0 "An Audience with the King"
 verkaldromak.1.d:0 "It’s an afternoon with an audience like [From.Monarch.GetName] held in their life many times before. Delegations from other holds or from lords in Rahen, influential beings form all over the realm and plead for jurisdiction and mercy. One of the attendances is the local archmage. He waits impatiently for his issue to be called upon and hastily burst forward when the herald proclaims his rank and name.\n\n\"Sire, I have to speak of a strange phenomenon that seems to happen in our hold. People from all classes and places gain magical powers. But their magic works in no way we have ever seen. We call them Sleepers because we think they draw their energy from their sleep. We don’t know if their casting can do any harm or can be fully controlled. The guild urges you to forbid them to use their powers without our supervision.\""
 verkaldromak.1.a:0 "Better safe than sorry, let the experienced mages be in control."
 verkaldromak.1.b:0 "This isn’t about safety, this is about power. Not with me!"

 verkaldromak.2.t:0 "Regulations in place"
 verkaldromak.2.d:0 "Months have passed since the regulations were put in place and results start to show.\n\nThe good news: the mages can’t report of any incidents that got people harmed.\n\nThe bad news: the common people become unsettled since the supervision of the guild comes with a big tax if one wants to use the service of a Sleeper making it unaffordable for most citizens and forcing them back to regular mages."
 verkaldromak.2.a:0 "We won’t support their greed anymore!"
 verkaldromak.2.b:0 "The commons are to blind to see what’s good for them."

 verkaldromak.3.t:0 "Integration of the Sleepers"
 verkaldromak.3.d:0 "The Sleepers are free to offer their services on their own accord. And there aren’t reports of any incidents. It seems they handle well on their own.\n\nIt looks like the mages have accepted the role of the Sleepers and proposed to make them part of the guild with all rights and duties."
 verkaldromak.3.a:0 "This is clearly a trick again."
 verkaldromak.3.b:0 "It’s good that they can work together now."

 verkaldromak.4.t:0 "Magic from the people for the people"
 verkaldromak.4.d:0 "The Sleepers out right refuse to be put into the guild since the rules would force them to “study for decades”. They state that this is clearly only to give the guild time to find a lasting solution to regain its power. They were able to help people even without pockets deep enough to afford the guild to get magical help and they want it to stay that way."
 verkaldromak.4.a:0 "Maybe their own way is the best for the people."
 verkaldromak.4.b:0 "The guild is an established institution. Why change that?"

 verkaldromak.5.t:0 "Warnings from the past"
 verkaldromak.5.d:0 "The guild becomes heavily displeased with [From.Monarch.GetName] decisions regarding the Sleepers. This has begun to stir trouble not only in Verkal Dromak but the whole nation and beyond. Mages from our whole sphere of influence send delegations or letters to change their stance on the topic and even [A85.Monarch.GetName] the [A85.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Magisterium has sent one. He cites treatises on historical catastrophes sparked by the rise of parallel authorities who don’t have to answer to their sovereign and unrestricted magic. How they led to the fall of empires and the deaths of millions."
 verkaldromak.5.a:0 "That desperation is just pathetic."
 verkaldromak.5.b:0 "He’s right, history tends to repeat itself."

 verkaldromak.6.t:0 "The establishment holds together"
 verkaldromak.6.d:0 "No estate stands alone for itself. The estates are a clockwork who’s gears interlock with varying success, but still always interlock. The mages called upon these dependencies, used their leverage on keyfiguers and finely tipped the balance so [From.Monarch.GetName] has to deal with a united front of the powerful and influential."
 verkaldromak.6.a:0 "The corruption of power goes further than we thought."

 verkaldromak.7.t:0 "Remember: your power comes from us"
 verkaldromak.7.d:0 "The united upper class have grown confident in their strength. They sent [From.Monarch.GetName] an ultimatum: expel the Sleepers or the estates will \"save the nation from a ruler who’s clearly a threat for their own subjects\"."
 verkaldromak.7.a:0 "It’s treason then!"
 verkaldromak.7.b:0 "To stay in power is more important than some mages."

 verkaldromak.8.t:0 "The mages are dead long live the mages"
 verkaldromak.8.d:0 "In the end the guild has paid the price for it’s ignorance. Most of its members lay dead in the corridors and halls of their academy with the captured soon to hang on its walls. The fights were hard and left their marks everywhere but after the last clash of weapons decayed and the smell of ozone faded the commons returned to their life surprisingly quickly. The power vacuum of the guild’s power structure is filled in the blink of an eye with Sleepers. The court and the other estates are a bit startled by the abrupt normality but just give in."
 verkaldromak.8.a:0 "Hopefully we can leave this dark chapter behind us now."

 verkaldromak.9.t:0 "Never forget your history"
 verkaldromak.9.d:0 "The Sleepers have enough of their suppression by the guild and are rising up. In a matter of minutes they control important crossroads, squares and bridges. Ambushes are laid everywhere and our troops are slaughtered in masses. If that wasn’t a catastrophe their backing of the commons is. We can’t get a hold of them since their spies are everywhere and every door is an escape route. The capital is a theatre of war now.\n\nSuddenly grim news reach the troops from the palace. [From.Monarch.GetName] and his family got murdered by an usurpator, who bases his claim on his lineage of the ancient dynasty of Verkal Dromak. And the new orders are clear, turn against the mages and fight along the Sleepers. The momentum of the conflict makes it easy for most soldiers to obey the orders. Those who don’t get a sharp lessen why righteousness isn’t always the right answer."
 verkaldromak.9.a:0 "Planned or opportunism, the orders are clear."

# Event chain 2
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 verkaldromak.10.t:0 "A shared dream"
 verkaldromak.10.d:0 "The Sleeper always labeled themselves as a provider for all people. They support those whose actions helped not some but many. Even if this attitude is commonly known, their latest consequence is a surprise for [From.Monarch.GetName]: As they see the ruler as the first servant of the state, the ruler should have all power to serve his people including the power of magic."
 verkaldromak.10.a:0 "We have neither time nor talent. But they can in the future."
 verkaldromak.10.b:0 "They are right, the ruler should be a Sleeper. So they should make me one."

 verkaldromak.11.t:0 "Gone too soon"
 verkaldromak.11.d:0 "Bells of mourning hall through the hold as the news of [From.Monarch.GetName] death spread through the levels of Verkal Dromak. He died in a terrible accident when the rope of a crane tore and lost its giant marble block."
 verkaldromak.11.a:0 "The new ruler Gotrek proclaims a week of morning."

 verkaldromak.12.t:0 "Their ways are off"
 verkaldromak.12.d:0 "Since the beginning of their studies [From.Monarch.GetName] had success after success in their studies and practices. However they never had the feeling it’s them who controls their magic but even if they did something different then what was requested the outcome was still what they wanted. This strange feeling keeps bothering [From.Monarch.GetName] for weeks now."
 verkaldromak.12.a:0 "Those Sleepers are up to something. Send someone to investigate."
 verkaldromak.12.b:0 "Maybe I’m just a natural and use my subconsciousness."

 verkaldromak.13.t:0 "Unsuccesfull spy mission"
 verkaldromak.13.d:0 "Sleepers easly catched your spy. They seems to be very unhappy about your lack of trust. Fortunetely they didn't halt your education."
 verkaldromak.13.a:0 "It will be fine"

 verkaldromak.14.t:0 "Train crash"
 verkaldromak.14.d:0 "It happened on a beautiful afternoon. [From.Monarch.GetName] and his family were on the way to their palace on the surface. Suddenly the air is filled with the sound of bursting glass and toren steel plates. The train just derailed and fell into a canyon taking all of its passengers with it."
 verkaldromak.14.a:0 "The new ruler Gotrek, former archmage of the Sleepers, proclaims a week of mourning."

 verkaldromak.15.t:0 "This is suspisious"
 verkaldromak.15.d:0 "Emergency meeting of the government. Maybe we should investigate circumstances of our ruler death? Maybe mages did this to get full control over state? Mages are opposed (obviously), but representatives of nobility, traders and clergy really press for hiring independent investigators."
 verkaldromak.15.a:0 "Lets do this"
 verkaldromak.15.b:0 "No way mages could do something like that"

 verkaldromak.16.t:0 "No proof?"
 verkaldromak.16.d:0 "Detective didn't find anything. He asks for permission to search in mages private homes."
 verkaldromak.16.a:0 "If you need to"
 verkaldromak.16.b:0 "It is too expensive"

 verkaldromak.17.t:0 "Investigation?"
 verkaldromak.17.d:0 "Investigation takes too much money. Why can't you just trust mages?"
 verkaldromak.17.a:0 "We will not!"

 verkaldromak.18.t:0 "Where is he?"
 verkaldromak.18.d:0 "Detective disappeared. Maybe he just took money and run away? We won't continue investigation because some people are unhappy with it. It already costed too much."
 verkaldromak.18.a:0 "People will be sad"
