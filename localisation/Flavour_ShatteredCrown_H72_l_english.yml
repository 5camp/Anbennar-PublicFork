H72_outlive_siegebreaker_desc:0 "Word travels slow through the fractured Dwarovar, but it travels nontheless.

If the rumors are to be believed thousands of Black Orcs are answering the call, following the clans claim that Korgus has been enjoying initial success in his invasion of Escann.

H72_attract_escanni_refugees_desc:0 "Khugdihr is a hold devoid of orc or goblins to rule over, if we wish to make it a true boon to our realm, we should seek to repopulate these dwarven halls with those we can demand tribute from.

H72_legacy_of_korgus_desc:0 "When the Siegebreaker clan spread word through the Dwarovar that Korgus was winning but needed more men, we thought they might have been telling the truth. Now that we have established contact with the surface, it is clear that is not the case: He died to a human woman named Corin and his armies fractured back into clans who now fight one another as much as they fight the humans. Korgus has fallen, perhaps we can pick up the pieces."

They have been arguing for weeks now, interpreting old wall painting, dwarven murals about their ancient war against us and oral traditions from the various clans we have subjugated. Opinions differ wildly, some shamans say we must bring the fight to the dwarven adventurers, others say we must wait for a sign whilst others say we must expediate our search for Dookan and free him. \n\n All agree that we should hear out all Black Orc shamans we can find and secure safe access to holy sites in Verkal Vazkron and the Hall of the Ancestors.

shatteredcrown.1.t:0 "Siegebreaker Heretics"
shatteredcrown.1.d:0 "As our clans have established contact, [H80.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Siegebreaker has been sending shamans to our people calling us upon our dookan-given duty to fight the humans and their gods, who they hold accountable for Dookan being imprisoned. As they preach in the streets about the imminent victory of Korgus in Escann and his need for reinforcements from the faithful, many keep walking, but some do stand and listen. Such heretical thoughts largely fall on deaf ears in our society: We all know only the dwarves are responsible for His imprisonment. As [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] orders the shamans to leave the realm a small but not insignificant amount of orcs follow them. Heretics who believe that Korgus is the son of Dookan. Even worse: Some of our most prominent clan elders are leaving for Escann as well!"
shatteredcrown.1.a:0 "We must put an end to these heretical Siegebreakers before our clan shatters!"

shatteredcrown.4.t:0 "The Shaman Conclave"
shatteredcrown.4.d:0 "There haven't been this many shamans gathered together in our realm is a very long time. The return of the dwarves has stirred up even the oldest of our professions. They gathered to discuss findings, visions, omens, ancient dwarven murals, old orc wallpaintings and discrepancies in the oral traditions of the various clans. \n\n The conclave took three whole days, but in the end the majority of the shamans came to the same conclusion: The answer to how Dookan is freed and how the dwarves can be defeated does not lie in Amldihr, it lies in Hul-Jorkad. The place where our history begins, the place where the ancients told stories of meeting Dookan himself. Deep down in that hold, we must go."
shatteredcrown.4.a:0 "We must return from where we came."
shatteredcrown.5.t:0 "Goblin Maps"
shatteredcrown.5.d:0 "As the goblins of the Dwarovrod adjust to our rule, they quickly figure out how to make themselves useful.

shatteredcrown.6.t:0 "Zealous Settlers"
shatteredcrown.6.d:0 "As our government begins funding colonisation efforts towards Hul-Jorkad, we have found aid from a small faction of zealous orcs. They call themselves the Kar-Ankash, meaning Black Chosen. They believe the search for Dookan has been neglected for far too long and our occupation of the dwarven capital is an good way to contribute to keeping the dwarves out but far from enough to consider our Dookansearch fulfilled. They say they wish to aid our quest to Hul-Jorkad. Their men send their families to the colonies as they spend their savings on military equipment and offer to join the growing military.

It ends up lasting only a couple of days as they explore the first level of the hold. When their findings reach [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is shocked by the conclusion: \n\n In order to complete our Dookansearch, we shall need to pour all our efforts into exploring Hul-Jorkad, to this end our government shall need to be reformed and focused on repairing Hul-Jorkad and gaining access to the second level. \n\n To ensure this goes well the hold is going to need to become the seat of government, it will also need a sizeable company of experienced diggers and its surroundings need to secured so it can not be threatened by other states."
shatteredcrown.9.a:0 "This Dookansearch is going to be costly..."
shatteredcrown.10.t:0 "Fate Of The Mossmouth Ogres"
shatteredcrown.10.d:0 "As the swampy hills around Amldihr get more closely economically tied to Amldihr, so do its people. The ogres have seen the armor and weaponry we forged with dwarven foundries and wish for jobs in our realm so they may also afford such things. What do we do with this?"
shatteredcrown.10.a:0 "They may serve in the military"
shatteredcrown.10.b:0 "They may work in the mines"
shatteredcrown.10.c:0 "They are welcome in both the military and the mines"
shatteredcrown.10.e:0 "They will be purged, ogres are nothing but trouble."
shatteredcrown.11.t:0 "Settling The Valley"
shatteredcrown.11.d:0 "In order to increase our influence over the ogre swamps and to simultaneously drain orcs out of the overpopulated Amldihr area a resettlement program will send thousands into the valley. \n\n Earlier settlers have already mixed with ogres and out of this came a fiersome new species: half-orc, half-ogre, an Ogrillon. Hundreds of these are now reaching adulthood and have experienced trouble finding employment due to discrimination from both their parent races. With nowhere else to go, they are now starting to form into warbands, ready for hire."

shatteredcrown.19.d:0 "As Hul-Jorkad is being restored by thousands of our devout subjects, more and more history is uncovered. A large wall previously covered by debris now reveals a large chaotic drawing of what appears to be the orcish conquest of Hul-Jorkad. The shamans have looked at it for many days, discussing every detail and speculating about its age, whilst also trying to interpret the more damaged parts of the carvings. They conclude to [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] that the drawing does indeed show the conquest of Hul-Jorkad, our earliest piece of known history. There are some peculiar details though, one of which is that the orc army seems to be pouring in from below and not from one of the two gates from the first level. Other shamans mention that most orc carvings on battles clearly show an enlarged leader, with emboldened characteristics or a name carved next to them. This carving however shows no hierarchy, only chaos."

shatteredcrown.20.t:0 "Second Conclave Of Shamans"
shatteredcrown.20.d:0 "As the shamans of the realm travel to Hul-Jorkad to discuss what the next step of our Dookansearch should be, the clan holds its breath. Days go by, but eventually they conclude several things after studying more newfound relics of the past that were found, along with conclusion drawn from more contemporary sources, such as dwarven prisoners from previous wars and dwarven documents found in the holds we took. \n\n The first conclusion is that we must dig further down in Hul-Jorkad, so the shamans may find what lies below. \n\n The second conclusion is that we must seek out the hold of Dúr-Vazhatun because a group of dwarven prisoners from the Blueshield Company admit to being ordered to search the hold for information about the origin of orcs. Rumor within the group has it they were doing experiments on orcs before the hold fell. \n\n The last conclusion is that we should seek out one of the few holds that orcs nor goblins have taken, a so called remnant-hold. Such a hold would no doubt have kept records on us, which might illuminate where they took Dookan to. To this end the shamans urge [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to seek out Ovdal Lodhum or Arg-Ôrdstun, both of which reside along the Argrod, which intersects the Gorrod near Hul-Jorkad. To this end we should seek to gain control over the Gorrod as soon as possible."

shatteredcrown.21.d:0 "As the second layer of Hul-Jorkad is reached and the diggers start to clean up the debris, the long and arduous task of undoing damage done by orcs thousands of years ago begins. Pillars which used to bear the load of everything above have long since collapsed, accidental or intentional, and will have to be replaced. The central access shaft is the first to made operational so useless pieces of rock can be repurposed for construction projects back on the first layer. As more and more debris gets cleared it becomes clear that much of this layer used to be an army barracks to the dwarves of old. Military officials start hauling off items, weaponry and order scribes to document all stone writing on the hold pertaining to dwarven military organisation. \n\n Eventually the shamans and some military generals start complaining that it is near impossible to learn from dwarven writing, without tutoring... Perhaps it is time for some language classes."

shatteredcrown.22.t:0 "Learning Dwarven"

Most shamans are even unwilling to learn this unholy language, is it fit for a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to learn?"

After weeks of digging they uncovered what they were looking for: A lab, of which the roof has collapsed and sand has swallowed it whole. After another week of digging, the scientists grouped their findings: \n\n The dwarves of old were researching bones, or perhaps corpses. It is impossible to tell considering it is already a miracle the bones were preserved. The scientists are taking all the bones they could find back to [Root.Capital.GetName] for further investigation."

shatteredcrown.25.d:0 "The scientists who were researching the things found in Dûr Vazhatun have come to the court of [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] and present their findings: Some of the bones belonged to dwarves, which might have been test subjects but are likely to be scientists. The other bones belonged to orcs, ogres, goblins and an unknown humanoid race. The few notes that were able to be preserved, appear to be measurements documenting similarities in bone structure between these four races. Only shards of text have been recovered, such as: \n\n 'Notice how the orcs have ----- ears just li' \n\n 'If you average out their height, you get an orc' \n\n 'The orc changes adapts its skin to the tone of the cave, just like the goblin, indicating that per-' \n\n 'In conclusion: The orc menace from Hul-Jorkad has been demonstratively proven to -' . The notes also date the research at a few weeks after the fall of Amldihr, which means this was probably research related to the war. What could all this have been? Why do the dwarves say we are from Hul-Jorkad, do they not know where we were before that? What is the fourth race? The humans of escann? Another species?"
shatteredcrown.25.a:0 "Perhaps time will tell"
shatteredcrown.26.t:0 "Conclave On Orc Origin"
shatteredcrown.26.d:0 "As the scientists have been unable to explain what our true origin,exactly what happened at Hul-Jorkad and what the dwarves were researching in Dûr Vazhatun, the shamans of the realm have come together to discuss the findings and draw their own conclusions. After days of talking they bring their summary to [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]: We need to start collecting and cross-referencing the oral tradition of every single orc clan we can find. Only when we combine all our knowledge and weed out all mistakes that slipped into our oral traditions over the centuries can we comprehend our place in the world. It is time to write down our history and create a holy book: The Tugund-Oraz, the book of a thousand songs."
shatteredcrown.26.a:0 "The search continues"
shatteredcrown.27.t:0 "Green Orc Findings"
shatteredcrown.27.d:0 "Among the dozens of clans that now live in Escann, our shamans have spoken to hundreds of shamans to collect their oral traditions and comapre them with our own. Most clans deviated from our own recalling of history in ways we would expect: They participated in different sieges, occupied different regions, fought different orc clans and they accepted Korgus as the son of Dookan whilst we rejected him, which led them to Escann. Some however deviate slightly from our origin story. \n\n Where our shamans tell us that our story simply begins in Hul-Jorkad, without any notion on what our history before that might have been, three minor clans amongst the green orcs claim that we were created there by dookan himself. Could Hul-Jorkad really be the cradle of our race, and not just where our shamans stopped remembering and retelling old stories? Perhaps the clans to their north know, the gray orcs who followed Brasur Frozenmaw through the northern pass to Vrorenmarch will be our next target."
shatteredcrown.27.a:0 "Add it all to the Tugund-Oraz"
shatteredcrown.28.t:0 "Gray Orc Findings"
shatteredcrown.28.d:0 "Among the clans of Gray Orcs that followed Brasur Frozenmaw, our shamans started to compile the stories of their people. \n\n Their recent history includes getting cast out of the Serpentspine by Korgus for rejecting his teachings and subsequently uniting and conquering Vrorenmarch. Most of their ancient history is the same as ours, but among an almost extinct minor clan, the Axemaul clan, is where an interesting deviation lies: They claim that Dookan presented himself in physical form to a select few orcs in Hul-Jorkad, during the conquest of the hold. His avatar is said to be tall and slender, with pale skin like a Gray Orc. After the shamans discussed this story for days, they came to the conclusion that it is worthy of inclusion into the Tugund-Oraz, but not all believe it. Most clans have now had their stories added to the Tugund-Oraz, but some still remain. Let us go east of Hul-Jorkad and seek out other clans."

shatteredcrown.29.d:0 "The clans of Brown Orcs are a people that used to dwell near Grônstunad before being subjugated by the hobgoblins and forced to roam the surface to do their bidding. Despite their distance from our ancestral homeland and despite being subjugated by the hobgoblins, who reject gods, they are still devout followers of Dookan. Except for one problem... \n\n Most of the clans here do not call him Dookan, they call him Dookanil, claiming that is his true name they have always known. The rest of their stories and oral traditions are backed up by various stories from black orc clans we've met along the way on our conquest through the serpentspine, so they seem credible. A discovery worth further studying... Could we all have been using a shortened name for The Chained God all this time? Or have they simply modified the name themselves?"
shatteredcrown.29.a:0 "The Tugund-Oraz is almost complete."
shatteredcrown.30.t:0 "Deepwoods Diaspora"
shatteredcrown.30.d:0 "The Green Orc of Korgus have wandered outside of Escann, thousands upon thousands of them can be found here, in the Deepwoods. A region about which they say it is easy to enter but almost impossible to escape. They struggle in an eternal war against Forest Goblins and a mysterious race of tall and slender effeminate men. How orcs can struggle against such weak races is a mystery to us, perhaps they will do better under our guidance."

shatteredcrown.31.t:0 "A Mysterious Proposal"
shatteredcrown.31.d:0 "Not too long after merging the orc clans of the Deepwoods into one, with their strongest chief directly answering to us, they have been getting strange dreams. The chief claims he sees himself in the same dream every night, being invited by the spirits of the forest to walk down a certain path and befriending the spirits, forging an alliance between spirit and orc, together driving man, elf and goblin out. He claims he has found the path that he sees in his dreams, and has placed guards there so none may enter without his permission, the chief asks us... Should he?"

shatteredcrown.32.t:0 "The Ovdal Lodhum Library"
shatteredcrown.32.d:0 "As our plunders bring piles upon piles of books to the shamans, it becomes clear that the dwarves here have indeed written about the fall of their empire, our emergence and even about the battle in Hul-Jorkad. Our shamans, who are now proficient at dwarven have spent weeks reading the relevant books and have concluded that the dwarves were at war with another race during our early days: The elves. Not the ones from the Deepwoods or those of Bulwar, a clan of elves long gone now. A book tells about how right when the dwarves thought they were going to win the war, us orcs showed up in Hul-Jorkad and pushed the empire over the edge, fracturing it into individual holds and cutting Ovdal Ludhum off from communicating beyond the Gorrod. Some of the books speak about Arg-Ôrdstun, a hold we know to be along the Argrod as well, and which survived the fall as well, according to these books. We should seek out their knowledge."
shatteredcrown.32.a:0 "On the road again"
shatteredcrown.33.t:0 "The Arg-Ôrdstun Library"
shatteredcrown.33.d:0 "The Arg-Ôrdstun library is even larger than the one in Ovdal Lodhum was, which becomes evident as the plunderers and shamans get to work. It soon becomes clear that the dwarves here have also heard of and written about the fall of their empire, our emergence and about the battle in Hul-Jorkad. However, most information here about those events seem to be based on the same sources as those from Ovdal Ludhum, or even entirely based upon those books. One book is of peculiar interest though, a book borrowed from the Seghdihr library. It speaks of the seventh level of Hul-Jorkad, which was apparently used as a prison by the dwarven empire during the war, which housed elf commanders, entire elf regiments and even ogres and goblins who aided the elves in their war. We should seek out Seghdihr and raid their library."
shatteredcrown.33.a:0 "On the road again"
shatteredcrown.34.t:0 "The Sack Of Seghdihr"
shatteredcrown.34.d:0 "After weeks of reading, the shamans have summarized their findings to [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] based on several government documents: When Hul-Jorkad fell, a group of dwarves made it out alive and fled through the Dwarovrod to Seghdihr. They described thousands of monsters breaking out of the prison on the seventh floor and flooding the hold, the description they give of the monsters clearly indicates they speak of our ancestors. They did not say much more, just to fortify the gate northern gate and that they're heading to Grônstunad to report to the secondary capital, refusing to disclose classified information about Hul-Jorkad to the local governor of Seghdihr, to his frustration. It seems the shamans seem fixated on going to Grônstunad and tracking down that report."
shatteredcrown.34.a:0 "Grônstunad? But our dwarven maps say thats REALLY far."
shatteredcrown.35.t:0 "Grônstunad Library"
shatteredcrown.35.d:0 "After our shamans and their assistants dug through the contents of the library for weeks, they finally found it. A report about what transpired at Hul-Jorkad. It reads: \n\n It hadn't been a week since we had tranferred the prisoners from the elven army led by the wretched elf mage Ducaniel we defeated near Amldihr to the empire's maximum security prison on the 7th floor of Hul-Jorkad when the hold's alarm went off and the garrison rushed down the central shaft towards the prison. It appeared to be a prison break, but what came out of the shaft weren't elves, but an endless horde of what the men have taken to calling orcs. They burst out of the prison, some naked and without weapon, others with weapons of dwarven or elven make. They started ganging up on guards and citizens alike, fighting over their weapons, they just kept pouring out. When me and my men saw the hold was lost, we stopped looking down and instead climbed up. Nobody was allowed in or out the hold as the gates were shut due to the alarm. \n\n We waited and eventually more and more guards were called down, until none were left and we opened the gate with other citizens and caught the last train to and from Seghdihr, one which wont ride to Hul-Jorkad in a while, I think. I am writing this report on that very train and hope we manage to bring it to Grônstunad safely, if not and you find this message, please bring it to the Grônstunad so they can send reinforcements. -Grimmar Shalebeard, Tavernkeep of the Steel Mug in Hul-Jorkad."

shatteredcrown.36.t:0 "3: The Graveyard Of Trains"
shatteredcrown.36.d:0 "The shamans have been unable to find much in this third layer of the hold, except for the obvious: countless trains. Not as many as can be found in Er-Natvir, but still enough to forge weapons from for a hundred years. The shamans simply order the men to start digging into the next level after ensuring the new pillars can hold everything."
shatteredcrown.36.a:0 "This is for trading!"
shatteredcrown.36.b:0 "Let the people live in those trains"
shatteredcrown.37.t:0 "4: The Graveyard Of Trains"
shatteredcrown.37.d:0 "The shamans have been unable to find much in this fourth layer of the hold, aside from the trillions of mushrooms. They seem to come in endless shapes and colours: Red, white, big and brown, purple and glowing, sickening, poisonous, illusory, magical, rejuvinating, hallucinogenic, the list is endless. The shamans have taken a liking to some of them, using them for rituals and for attempting to commune with Dookan. Regardless, they order the men to keep digging down."
shatteredcrown.37.a:0 "These mushrooms can feed half the realm!"
shatteredcrown.37.b:0 "Fungi? Burn it down and let the layer be settled."
shatteredcrown.38.t:0 "5: The Market"
shatteredcrown.38.d:0 "The shamans have been almost unable to search this layer of the hold, as this layer holds such a large market full of ancient goods that they find themselves ordering dwarven 'art' to be destroyed for heresy so much they can hardly focus on the few murals and statues worth discussing. They fail to find much worthy of the shamans and they order the men to keep digging down."
shatteredcrown.38.a:0 "The market will be good for the local economy"
shatteredcrown.39.t:0 "6: The Forge"
shatteredcrown.39.d:0 "This sixth level is home to a huge forge, specifically designed to handle Mithril, built to accomodate the rich veins in the walls of this layer. The shamans seem more interested in the hundreds of dwarven and foreign weaponry and armour scattered around the central acces shaft down to the seventh level, proving that indeed, the main battle did indeed take place on the border between the sixth and seventh layer, which is said to be a prison. The shamans hastily order the men to keep digging, as they attempt to secure these relics of the past, which may have been the first orcish battle to have ever been fought and as such, a terrific holy site. The smiths of the hold say that the Mithril forge will need significant investments to get working again, as the massive chimney for the furnace that has been running along the side of the holds levels has been deconstucted or repurposed on the higher levels. Rebuilding a chimney of that size would dislocate entire neighbourhoods and the desecration of such a holy site is bound to lead to the annoyance of the shamans."
shatteredcrown.39.a:0 "This forge will bring our realm the metals we need!"
shatteredcrown.39.b:0 "This site is too sacred and that chimney is home to thousands, just export the mithril"
shatteredcrown.40.t:0 "7: The Prison"
shatteredcrown.40.d:0 "Days before the seventh level is reached, the sixth layer is already overflowing with thousands of shamans from every clan of orcs across Halcann. They sleep in tents and even on the ground, near the central access shaft, just to be as close as they can to what might be Dookans true location. As the days go by more and more ancient weaponry and armour is lifted from the shaft, the shaft seems be almost entirely filled with the remains of a battle, our first battle? \n\n Days later, orcs step foot on the seventh layer for what must be over seven and a half thousand years according to dwarven records. Shamans begin rushing down the shaft and over the rubble, climbing over fallen pillars, pushing one another aside in a frenzy to reach Dookan. Across the hold they find what might be the oldest orcs ever, naked and unarmed pertrified orcs, turned to stone by some dwarven mages. The shamans try unepetrifying one but he turns to stone. Among the group of stone orcs they see men and women, but no children. After searching for hours they pick up on a trace of magical energy in the damp air which they end up following to a large gate, the gate is adorned with large letters: Hul-Jorkad Prison. They enter into the building and finds thousands of cells, all with their steel doors broken open with such violence it would make even a berserking orc blush. As the horde of shamans, black, green, gray and brown make their way closer to the source of the magic, even the least gifted shaman can feel it, this source is incredibly potent. The thousands of shamans turn a corner, and then another, only to end up in the back of the prison, facing a Mithril cell with the key still in the open door, emanating so much raw magic it makes some shamans sick, others cry. This... This must be Dookans cell \n\n The shamans take turns observing the cell from a distance, none dare enter the room. They identify a circle of chalk on the floor used in some spell foreign to them, writing on the wall in a language they do not understand and magic in the air they can not identify."
shatteredcrown.40.a:0 "This entire level will be a holy site for all orcs"
shatteredcrown.40.b:0 "This cell is holy, but the rest of the floor can be used as a prison"
shatteredcrown.41.t:0 "The Last Conclave"
shatteredcrown.41.d:0 "The shamans of the realm have gathered one last time to discuss the facts, visions, stories, murals, relics, prophecies, the Dookansearch, the dwarven war and collapse, and that holy cell. They all agree on certain parts: Seven and a half thousand years ago the dwarves were waging a fierce war against a faction of elves, they almost captured the capital in Amldihr but were pushed back and one of their mage generals, Ducaniel, and his armies were imprisoned in the seventh level of Hul-Jorkad. From that level orcs have either spawned or erupted in large numbers and overtaken the hold. \n\n That is where the opinions begin to differ. As days of arguing turn into weeks, they still cannot decide if Dookan spawned them, they dug in, they were teleported in or they were prisoners like him. The Brown Orc shamans have perhaps the most divergent belief. They claim that the elf mage-general Ducaniel is in fact Dookan, and he cast a spell to create the orcs, ascending to godhood right in that cell. They cite their similar names, the fact that we have no history prior to this hold's level and the fact they have been calling him Dookanil all this time as insurmountable evidence of these facts. They differ on the opinion whether Dookan is still alive, or whether the magic in the air is all of him that's left. As the weeks go by more and more clan-shamans join their side, until the realm is split in two: Those who accept the notion that Ducaniel is Dookan, an elf-turned-god, who has since abandoned the orcs but has blessed them with life and purpose. And those who reject that notion: Dookan was not an elf but a god, perhaps disguised as an elf, using them to clear realm us to live in, spawning the orcish race in from this hold. He was however captured by dwarven gods and orcs must free him by killing dwarves and desecrating their temples until their gods are dead and Dookan is freed. \n\n The two factions present their cases to [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], who has to decide what becomes canon in the Tugund-Oraz."
shatteredcrown.41.a:0 "Ducaniel the elf is Dookan, he is now probably dead. We were created by elves."
shatteredcrown.41.b:0 "Dookan is alive but captured, Ducaniel was his avatar, we must focus on the Dookansearch."
