 bianfang.5.a:0 "So it goes."
 bianfang.6.t:0 "Tyrant System Debug event"
 bianfang.6.d:0 "Use this event to move yourself one way or the other. If you see this normally in-game, there's something very wrong."
 bianfang.6.a:0 "Become more Ruthless"
 bianfang.6.b:0 "Become more Benevolent"
 bianfang.7.t:0 "The Tyrants of the Yan"
 bianfang.7.d:0 "Our way of rule is strange to most Yan. The monks to our west, the decadent eunuchs down the river, the "benevolent" kings to South-East, they all call us one thing: Tyrants. \n\nOur administration is efficient, our armies are unmatched and dissent is not tolerated. They do not understand that this is what the Yan need, if they hope to survive the onslaught of the monstrous Hobgoblin Command. Yanshen needs an iron fist, unification and firm rule. \n\nHowever alien our rule may be to the locals, we must ensure their loyalty, one way or another. An iron fist Yanshen shall have, but shall it wear a silken glove, or will it crush all dissent ruthlessly underneath?"
 bianfang.7.a:0 "Tyrants we may be, but only time will tell how the people will perceive our rule."
 bianfang.8.t:0 "Ruthless Tyranny"
 bianfang.8.d:0 "Our rulers reign with absolute power, which they use liberally to crush all dissent without mercy and sometimes cooperating even with downright evil elements of society. Our subjects live in fear, which keeps them in line and our realm stable."
 bianfang.8.a:0 "The rule of an Iron Fist."
 bianfang.9.t:0 "A Pragmatic Approach"
 bianfang.9.d:0 "Our rulers reign with absolute power and keep their approach flexible and pragmatic. We do whatever is necessary to keep the realm stable, but we are just. Our subjects are kept in line by our rigorous enforcement of the law."
 bianfang.9.a:0 "We do what is necessary to keep the peace."
 bianfang.10.t:0 "A Benevolent Tyranny"
 bianfang.10.d:0 "Our rulers reign with absolute power, which they use benevolently and justly. Our subjects are at peace not due to threats of force, but because they view our rule as just."
 bianfang.10.a:0 "An Iron Fist in a Silken Glove."
 bianfang.11.t:0 "Fate of the Monasteries"
 bianfang.11.d:0 "We have conquered some of the Xia monasteries, what do we do?"
 bianfang.11.a:0 "Leave them be"
 bianfang.11.b:0 "They are a threat, dismantle them and loot the riches"
 bianfang.12.t:0 "Flight of the Keepers"
 bianfang.12.d:0 "The Keepers have fled taking their magic sword with them, never to be seen again"
 bianfang.12.a:0 "Oh no"
 bianfang.13.t:0 "Fate of the Eunuchs"
 bianfang.13.d:0 "The eunuchs hold great amounts of power in the lands we conquered. What should be do with them?"
 bianfang.13.a:0 "They can be our administators, they're good at that"
 bianfang.13.b:0 "We don't need them, drive them out"

 bianfang.15.t:0 "The Courts of Jindeshi"
 bianfang.15.d:0 "The Jiangshi are powerful enemies, and we must deal with them somehow. We could drive them out, and leave the people be, but that would upset our Righteous Path subjects. Alternatively, we could wipe them out along with their lefthand followers."
 bianfang.15.a:0 "Wickedness Must be Stamped Out!"
 bianfang.15.b:0 "Break the power of the Jiangshi, but leave the people be."
 bianfang.15.c:0 "Forge an alliance with the rulers of the night"
 bianfang.16.t:0 "Lefthand Followers Purged"
 bianfang.16.d:0 "The local followers of the Lefthand path have been forced to renounce their evil ways or driven out."
