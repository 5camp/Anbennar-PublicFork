 #Events
 bianfang.6.t:0 "Tyrant System Debug event"
 bianfang.6.d:0 "Use this event to move yourself one way or the other. If you see this normally in-game, there's something very wrong."
 bianfang.6.a:0 "Become more Ruthless"
 bianfang.6.b:0 "Become more Benevolent"
 bianfang.7.t:0 "The Tyrants of the Yan"
 bianfang.7.d:0 "Our way of rule is strange to most Yan. The monks to our west, the decadent eunuchs down the river, the "benevolent" kings to South-East, they all call us one thing: Tyrants. \n\nOur administration is efficient, our armies are unmatched and dissent is not tolerated. They do not understand that this is what the Yan need, if they hope to survive the onslaught of the monstrous Hobgoblin Command. Yanshen needs an iron fist, unification and firm rule. \n\nHowever alien our rule may be to the locals, we must ensure their loyalty, one way or another. An iron fist Yanshen shall have, but shall it wear a silken glove, or will it crush all dissent ruthlessly underneath?"
 bianfang.7.a:0 "Tyrants we may be, but only time will tell how the people will perceive our rule."
 bianfang.8.t:0 "Ruthless Tyranny"
 bianfang.8.d:0 "Our rulers reign with absolute power, which they use liberally to crush all dissent without mercy and sometimes cooperating even with downright evil elements of society. Our subjects live in fear, which keeps them in line and our realm stable."
 bianfang.8.a:0 "The rule of an Iron Fist."
 bianfang.9.t:0 "A Pragmatic Approach"
 bianfang.9.d:0 "Our rulers reign with absolute power and keep their approach flexible and pragmatic. We do whatever is necessary to keep the realm stable, but we are just. Our subjects are kept in line by our rigorous enforcement of the law."
 bianfang.9.a:0 "We do what is necessary to keep the peace."
 bianfang.10.t:0 "A Benevolent Tyranny"
 bianfang.10.d:0 "Our rulers reign with absolute power, which they use benevolently and justly. Our subjects are at peace not due to threats of force, but because they view our rule as good."
 bianfang.10.a:0 "An Iron Fist in a Silken Glove."
