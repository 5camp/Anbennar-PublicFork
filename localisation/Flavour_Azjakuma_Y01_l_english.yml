 ## Missions ##
 Y01_harimari_fort_title:0 "The Harimari Fortress"
 Y01_harimari_fort_desc:0 "Of all the squabbling city-states of Yanshen, there is perhaps none other like Hubao. The decrepit corpse of the old harimari empire, the statelet has managed to retain a vestige of its predecessor's organization and is capable of, even now, mustering armies strong enough to give our probing forces pause. We need to stomp them out now, while they cannot defeat a true oni army."
 Y01_expel_rebellious_title:0 "Expel the Rebellious"
 Y01_expel_rebellious_desc:0 "The harimari of these new lands are some of the most staunch followers of the foreign "High Philosophy", their heraldry immediately recognizable from the countless expeditions they have led against the oni. Even now they conspire to remove our rule. Expel the harimari, expunge them and replace them with subjects who will be more pliable to our regime."
 Y01_direct_control_tribute_title:0 "Direct Control of Tributaries"
 Y01_direct_control_tribute_desc:0 "The lords of Yuanszi have been wise enough to bring tribute to Azjakuma, prostrating themselves and bearing gifts. There is nothing wrong with this. However, with the threat of the Command looming, their strength must be fully joined to ours. They will understand, in due time."
 Y01_integration_yuantsai_title:0 "Integration of the Yuantsai"
 Y01_integration_yuantsai_desc:0 ""
 Y01_expand_record_keeping_title:0 "Expand Record Keeping"
 Y01_expand_record_keeping_desc:0 "One of the prides of the oni is our extensive record-keeping, dating back millennia. Any work, any event, of interest to the kingdom has been logged and stored - and, unlike a certain group, it has stayed intact. Yet the organization of these works is haphazard, improvised, a temporary solution pretending to be a permanent one. These records will need to be sorted out and well organized if they are to be of any use."
 Y01_ajgriijarul_training_title:0 "Ajgriijarul Training"
 Y01_ajgriijarul_training_desc:0 "The Shirgrii of the Ajgriijarul are some of the strongest warriors in Haless, perhaps even in all of Halann. If one so pleased, they might well tear a human in half, or rip their head off and take the spine with it. More than just simple raw strength, though, the Ajgriijarul understand warfare very intimately. Their displays of violence and bloodshed seem mindless, even chaotic, but this cannot be further from the truth: each gruesome death is carefully choreographed in order to create the most intimidating warrior possible.\n\nAlthough they cannot be the entire army, coaxing them to share their secrets by training the less-skilled will afford us an invaluable asset."
 Y01_chumijemoya_spymasters_title:0 "Chumijemoya Spymasters"
 Y01_chumijemoya_spymasters_desc:0 "The Chumijemoya are incredibly effective spymasters. There is little more to be said about them - for there is nowhere to say such things that they cannot hear, and a grudge from them is lethal indeed. They are something of an anomaly, to put it politely, for there are no other oni able to rival their ability to gather information - masters of extortion, torture, domination magic, and simple contact networks, little stays unknown by them if they desire to know it. Their position has brought them to become indolent in recent years - no more! Their services shall be put to the use of the Rashenbir without a moment's delay!"
 Y01_infiltrate_eunuch_council_title:0 "Infiltrating Heiyukcheng"
 Y01_infiltrate_eunuch_council_desc:0 "The eunuch statelet known as Jinqiu are squatters, looters, and vultures beyond measure. The very land they attempt to rule upon is the former domain of the Khelorvalshi, a Shirgrii considered extinct, made exclusively of banished oni. More than some of these were banished for academic reasons - that is to say, they peddled in knowledge befitting not even the oni. The eunuchs of Jinqiu have doubtlessly seized their research and turned it to their own twisted ends; that, even without a dynasty, they may live forever.\n\nSuch greed does not come without cost, however. They are greedy, capricious, and manipulable. To send the Chumijemoya after them will be an affair that is almost too easy, and even simpler still to corrupt their council and drag it down to where it is needed."
 Y01_cursed_souls_khelorvalshi_title:0 "Cursed Souls of Khelorvalshi"
 Y01_cursed_souls_khelorvalshi_desc:0 "The Khelorvalshi have evolved beyond their collective banishments, having absorbed their surroundings to create a Shirgrii as unique as any other, a Shirgrii of madmen, lunatics, and maniacs - but resourceful, scholastic, and inventive. Obviously, they could threaten the established social order of the oni. Yet, even so, they present an opportunity, should the risk prove sufficient."
 Y01_restoring_khelorvalshi_title:0 "Restoring Khelorvalshi"
 Y01_restoring_khelorvalshi_desc:0 "Khelorvalshi, named for the Shirgrii that resided within, has finally had its time come. The city has been left in ruins, considered cursed and looted by scavengers and 'adventurers' alike. The oni have no such qualms about resettling their own lands, for it is cursed only for our lesser rivals. A permanent settlement will enable Azjakuma to survey what has been lost."
 Y01_khelorvalshi_libraries_title:0 "Khelorvalshi Libraries"
 Y01_khelorvalshi_libraries_desc:0 "The greatest reward for the resettlement of Khelorvalshi is easily its libraries - vast stores of knowledge remain hidden within its boundaries, the manifests and codexes certainly considered too cursed to tamper with. Renovating the city further will give us free leave to pilfer the knowledge within and record it within our own state libraries, whilst leaving the Shirgrii without this potentially-destabilizing information."
 Y01_way_forward_title:0 "The Way Forward"
 Y01_way_forward_desc:0 "We have seen so much done, accomplished so much on our own terms, but what does it all mean? The future of the oni remains uncertain, and the threat of annihilation by fanatical warrior-monks remains an all-too-present possibility. Azjakuma must be a single, united state to exploit the opportunity ahead. Without total unity, a fully ordered land, there awaits only death for the Lefthand path.\n\nThe future will be won by spell and by blade, for that is our best future. It must be."
 Y01_bring_birb_to_heel_title:0 "Bring the Bird Riders to Heel"
 Y01_bring_birb_to_heel_desc:0 "The terrorbird riders, infamous raiders and fanatical warriors, have proven themselves a menace once more. United under the auspices of an enigmatic new queen, their mounted hosts march in ever-greater numbers and with ever-better discipline. Indeed, if they are allowed to muster their forces to match their potential and given the resources to supply them, it might well become the age of the bird.\n\nThere is one critical weakness to these birds - they require a specialized feed that requires the use of cereals. Should their grain-producing lands be seized, then their forces will surely be starved out. See it done."
 Y01_winning_over_birb_title:0 "Winning Over the Shuvüüsh"
 Y01_winning_over_birb_desc:0 "Even though it might seem like the obvious solution, the wide scale extermination of the Shuvüüsh is simply impractical. The oni are not as practiced at manipulating their lands, and besides that there simply are not enough settlers to fill their place. They will need to be won over to our cause by one means or another, for that is the only way we will be able to extract any worth out of their domain. With time, even their fanaticism may be beaten down and corrupted."
 Y01_birb_auxillaries_title:0 "Bird Rider Auxillaries"
 Y01_birb_auxillaries_desc:0 "Patience brings success. A not insignificant amount of the Shuvüüsh have come around to our rule, swayed by security and stability - under the yoke, obviously. They contribute their dues, pay taxes, participate in state-sponsored functions, and, most importantly, have stopped trying to hide from conscription duties. A unit of Lefthand bird-riders have been prepared and armed, ready to serve as auxiliaries for our forces."
 Y01_breadbasket_north_title:0 "Breadbasket of the North"
 Y01_breadbasket_north_desc:0 "The grain-producing Shuvüüsh lands are incredibly fertile and resilient, requiring far less effort to keep the crops grown strong. With the newfound support base, it is obvious that the lands need to be exploited to their fullest. The food provided will ensure that the oni population might continue to grow even if all other sources of sustenance are snuffed out. Similarly, the increased output will allow for more soldiers to be raised."
 Y01_adapting_oni_state_title:0 "Adapting the Oni State"
 Y01_adapting_oni_state_desc:0 "The single fatal flaw of the oni is our natural isolation. Numbers notwithstanding, most tend to congregate into Shirgrii and tend to their own villages and towns, paying little regard for the affairs of others. As shown by recent successes, it is only by mixing the Shirgrii that the oni can survive. New cities, new roads, the state shall be adapted to mend these flaws. A series of new, planned cities will serve to connect the oni further than ever before."
 Y01_teimarji_spring_title:0 "The Teimarji Spring"
 Y01_teimarji_spring_desc:0 "Teimarji, a glowing blue rock which enhances an individual's magical power. When properly treated, it can do the exact opposite to great effect. However, it needs to be present to enable this - the rock only comes from the sky, and in exceedingly small amounts. Whatever can be found needs to be harvested.\n\nThe Shinukhorchi have an intrinsic link to the material, being capable of reaching out their spirits short distances to 'feel' for it. A deposit was discovered near the capital, creating springs of magically amplified water. Dig it up."
 Y01_kabiurgarko_tributary_title:0 "Kabiurgarko Tributaries"
 Y01_kabiurgarko_tributary_desc:0 "The Kabiurgarko are infamous for their greed, going to extreme lengths to preserve and grow their wealth. The most famous of their exploits was the creation of great record-keeping systems, meticulously recording all tribute extracted and from where in order to maximize their wealth intake. Naturally, that makes them a natural Shirgrii for tax collection. With the right deals, they can be brought around to utilize their skills to collect all due - and no less - from our subjects."
 Y01_golden_gates_title:0 "Golden Gates of Hokuma"
 Y01_golden_gates_desc:0 "Most people would be quick to describe themselves as pious, as righteous, as unwilling to contribute to their perceived evil. The truth of the matter is different. Cheap goods, attainable luxuries, a week's pleasure for a day's work - these are the true desires of man. Most would attest the opposite, but many would buy oni goods if they were cheap and through a merchant; for then they might pretend that what they do is righteous. Ultimately, it is all the better - for us!"
 Y01_defend_north_title:0 "Defend the North"
 Y01_defend_north_desc:0 "All other matters have simply bought time; the only defense is offense. The hobgoblins grow impatient with us, frustrated and angry at our continued sovereignty. If we were to allow the Command to have its way, the oni would be ground to dust under a legion of hobgoblin boots - but that is the delusion born of false strength. Shatter the command, show them that no discipline can stop them from being lesser! Send their broken bodies back into the mountains, never to return!"
 Y01_aikogeoke_title:0 "Aikogeoke"
 Y01_aikogeoke_desc:0 "The lands known as Aikogeoke, conveniently shaped similarly to one of our own internal provinces, have remained uncontrolled for centuries. The lands are a substantial distance from any Shirgrii, and until now none have seen anything desirable in those sparse, pastoral lands. With the world rumbling with change, this too must come to an end. Instead of any Shirgrii, the state itself shall take an interest in these lands. It shall provide a formidable border fort, and perhaps even a redoubt against any invading forces."

 flavor_azjakuma.4.d:0 "It is time for the meeting of the Tagharoghi to decide upon a successor. The leaders of the great Shirgrii have all gathered in Shinukhorchi to present their candidate to the Rashenbir in hopes they'll be chosen as the Rashokudei, destined to become the next sovereign over all of Azjakuma. As is customary, they've also brought gifts in the form of knowledge or gold from their temple. All that is left now is for our Rashenbir to choose an apprentice."

Until that time that they might be toppled in war, they will need to be kept appeased./n/nThe greatest threats to their budding social order are the mages, whose spells might topple it in mere hours. We could easily keep them at bay with the oni specialty, black damestear. A trade will do well - for peace, they will receive what they need to keep their mages in check. It will only last as long as they need more, of course, but even a little time is better than none."

 shirgriiFallOption: "Josmuk!"
 shinukhorchiFallTitle:0 "Fall of Shinukhorchi"
 shinukhorchiFallDesc:0 "The grandest of all the Shirgrii, Shinukhorchi has stood since time immemorial as the capital of our people. Now we must despair, for the ancient citadel has been wrested from us by our enemies, the wise sages of the temple have scattered to the countryside and the remaining Shirgrii. The future of Azjakuma appears bleak."
 chumijemoyaFallTitle:0 "Fall of Chumijemoya"
 chumijemoyaFallDesc:0 "The hidden temple of Chumijemoya has fallen, the inhabitants slaughtered as they tried to hide the secret documents and scrolls housed within. Already the survivors have joined the remaining Shirgrii, plotting the restoration of their bastion. The future of Azjakuma is uncertain."
 ajgriijarulFallTitle:0 "Fall of Ajgriijarul"
 ajgriijarulFallDesc:0 "Many armies have tried to destroy Ajgriijarul, and just as many have faltered and become just another bloodstain on its walls. Today though, the citadel has met its match. They fought with ferocity and bravery, not giving up an inch of their home without a fight. Though most of the warriors fell in battle, the few survivors have scattered throughout the countryside, angrily assaulting all that approach them. The future of Azjakuma hangs in the balance."
 kabiurgarkoFallTitle:0 "Fall of Kabiurgarko"
 kabiurgarkoFallDesc:0 "The shining walls of Kabiurgarko have been stained with blood as our enemies have rampages through its halls, looting its great vaults and desecrating its grounds. The few that managed to escape have flocked to their sister Shirgrii, zealously scheming the reclamation of their wealth. The future of Azjakuma is dark."
 khelorvalshiFallTitle:0 "Fall of Khelorvalshi"
 khelorvalshiFallDesc:0 "The restored Shirgrii of Khelorvalshi has fallen once again, invaders storming its blackened halls and attempting to breach into the forbidden vaults. The Oni within the temple seem to have vanished, disappearing without a trace as the gates were blown open. Wherever they went, their taboo wisdom is no longer at our disposal. The future of Azjakuma is unknown."
 shinukhorchiRegainedTitle:0 "Shinukhorchi Restored"
 shinukhorchiRegainedDesc:0 "In a grand battle that will surely be remembered for eternity, our fallen capital of Shinukhorchi has finally been reclaimed. Never again shall her walls be desecrated by the unworthy, her grounds disgraced by barbarians. Already the sages and monks that were forced to flee have returned to the citadel, and damned be us all should it fall again."
 shinukhorchiRegainedOption:0 "May her fires never be snuffed again!"
 chumijemoyaRegainedTitle:0 "Chumijemoya Restored"
 chumijemoyaRegainedDesc:0 "Thanks in no small part to the plotting and plans of her rightful inhabitants, the hidden temple of Chumijemoya has been pried from the hands of our enemies. The damage from the battle is already being repaired as the temple's inhabitants take stock of the scrolls housed within, destroying any that may have been read by the occupiers."
 chumijemoyaregainedOption:0 "Hopefully it won't take too long."
 ajgriijarulRegainedTitle:0 "Ajgriijarul Restored"
 ajgriijarulRegainedDesc:0 "The moment the gates were opened, they appeared from the mists, the enraged warriors of Ajriijarul. Shoving past our armies they tore into their restored home, eager to seek revenge on those that stole it from them. They may be busy for quite some time, and the citadel will surely need cleaning, but at long last we have regained the Shirgrii."
 ajgriijarulRegainedOption:0 "They'll settle down eventually."
 kabiurgarkoRegainedTitle:0 "Kabiurgarko Restored"
 kabiurgarkoRegainedDesc:0 "Across Azjakuma are celebrations as the golden gates of Kabiurgarko lay within our hands once again. Assisted by human agents within the citadel, our armies took it with minimal damage to the structure, much to the delight of the inhabitants that have swiftly returned to their vast stashes of wealth."
 kabiurgarkoRegainedOption:0 "Let the gold flow!"
 khelorvalshiRegainedTitle:0 "Khelorvalshi Restored"
 khelorvalshiRegainedDesc:0 "When we stormed back into Khelorvalshi we were expecting an occupying force. Instead we were met with the original Oni inhabitants, carrying on as if nothing had happened and claiming that they had always been there. Whatever the case, the secrets of Khelorvalshi are now ours once again."
 khelorvalshiRegainedOption:0 "I have many questions."
