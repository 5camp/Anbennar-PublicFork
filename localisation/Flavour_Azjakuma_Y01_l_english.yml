 ## Missions ##
 Y01_harimari_fort_title:0 "The Harimari Fortress"
 Y01_harimari_fort_desc:0 "Of all the squabbling city-states of Yanshen, there is perhaps none other like Hubao. The decrepit corpse of the old harimari empire, the statelet has managed to retain a vestige of its predecessor's organization and is capable of, even now, mustering armies strong enough to give our probing forces pause. We need to stomp them out now, while they cannot defeat a true oni army."
 Y01_expel_rebellious_title:0 "Expel the Rebellious"
 Y01_expel_rebellious_desc:0 "The harimari of these new lands are some of the most staunch followers of the foreign "High Philosophy", their heraldry immediately recognizable from the countless expeditions they have led against the oni. Even now they conspire to remove our rule. Expel the harimari, expunge them and replace them with subjects who will be more pliable to our regime."
 Y01_direct_control_tribute_title:0 "Direct Control of Tributaries"
 Y01_direct_control_tribute_desc:0 "The lords of Yuanszi have been wise enough to bring tribute to Azjakuma, prostrating themselves and bearing gifts. There is nothing wrong with this. However, with the threat of the Command looming, their strength must be fully joined to ours. They will understand, in due time."
 Y01_expand_record_keeping_title:0 "Expand Record Keeping"
 Y01_expand_record_keeping_desc:0 "One of the prides of the oni is our extensive record-keeping, dating back millennia. Any work, any event, of interest to the kingdom has been logged and stored - and, unlike a certain group, it has stayed intact. Yet the organization of these works is haphazard, improvised, a temporary solution pretending to be a permanent one. These records will need to be sorted out and well organized if they are to be of any use."
 Y01_ajgriijarul_training_title:0 "Ajgriijarul Training"
 Y01_ajgriijarul_training_desc:0 "The Shirgrii of the Ajgriijarul are some of the strongest warriors in Haless, perhaps even in all of Halann. If one so pleased, they might well tear a human in half, or rip their head off and take the spine with it. More than just simple raw strength, though, the Ajgriijarul understand warfare very intimately. Their displays of violence and bloodshed seem mindless, even chaotic, but this cannot be further from the truth: each gruesome death is carefully choreographed in order to create the most intimidating warrior possible.\n\nAlthough they cannot be the entire army, coaxing them to share their secrets by training the less-skilled will afford us an invaluable asset."
 Y01_chumijemoya_spymasters_title:0 "Chumijemoya Spymasters"
 Y01_chumijemoya_spymasters_desc:0 "The Chumijemoya are incredibly effective spymasters. There is little more to be said about them - for there is nowhere to say such things that they cannot hear, and a grudge from them is lethal indeed. They are something of an anomaly, to put it politely, for there are no other oni able to rival their ability to gather information - masters of extortion, torture, domination magic, and simple contact networks, little stays unknown by them if they desire to know it. Their position has brought them to become indolent in recent years - no more! Their services shall be put to the use of the Rashenbir without a moment's delay!"
 Y01_infiltrate_eunuch_council_title:0 "Infiltrating Heiyukcheng"
 Y01_infiltrate_eunuch_council_desc:0 "The eunuch statelet known as Jinqiu are squatters, looters, and vultures beyond measure. The very land they attempt to rule upon is the former domain of the Khelorvalshi, a Shirgrii considered extinct, made exclusively of banished oni. More than some of these were banished for academic reasons - that is to say, they peddled in knowledge befitting not even the oni. The eunuchs of Jinqiu have doubtlessly seized their research and turned it to their own twisted ends; that, even without a dynasty, they may live forever.\n\nSuch greed does not come without cost, however. They are greedy, capricious, and manipulable. To send the Chumijemoya after them will be an affair that is almost too easy, and even simpler still to corrupt their council and drag it down to where it is needed."
 Y01_cursed_souls_khelorvalshi_title:0 "Cursed Souls of Khelorvalshi"
 Y01_cursed_souls_khelorvalshi_desc:0 "The Khelorvalshi have evolved beyond their collective banishments, having absorbed their surroundings to create a Shirgrii as unique as any other, a Shirgrii of madmen, lunatics, and maniacs - but resourceful, scholastic, and inventive. Obviously, they could threaten the established social order of the oni. Yet, even so, they present an opportunity, should the risk prove sufficient."
 Y01_restoring_khelorvalshi_title:0 "Restoring Khelorvalshi"
 Y01_restoring_khelorvalshi_desc:0 "Khelorvalshi, named for the Shirgrii that resided within, has finally had its time come. The city has been left in ruins, considered cursed and looted by scavengers and 'adventurers' alike. The oni have no such qualms about resettling their own lands, for it is cursed only for our lesser rivals. A permanent settlement will enable Azjakuma to survey what has been lost."
 Y01_khelorvalshi_libraries_title:0 "Khelorvalshi Libraries"
 Y01_khelorvalshi_libraries_desc:0 "The greatest reward for the resettlement of Khelorvalshi is easily its libraries - vast stores of knowledge remain hidden within its boundaries, the manifests and codexes certainly considered too cursed to tamper with. Renovating the city further will give us free leave to pilfer the knowledge within and record it within our own state libraries, whilst leaving the Shirgrii without this potentially-destabilizing information."
 Y01_way_forward_title:0 "The Final Meeting of the Tagharoghi"
 Y01_way_forward_desc:0 "What will become of the Oni? As the matters of state become more than that of managing squabbling clans, and as Azjakuma must spend more of its time governing and exploiting new subjects over tending the Demon Hills, this question only becomes more intense. The Rashenbir chafes, for the Shirgrii jealously guard old privileges even as they become anathema to the new Azjakuma. Perhaps one last meeting of the Tagharoghi will do us well..."
 Y01_bring_birb_to_heel_title:0 "Bring the Bird Riders to Heel"
 Y01_bring_birb_to_heel_desc:0 "The terrorbird riders, infamous raiders and fanatical warriors, have proven themselves a menace once more. United under the auspices of an enigmatic new queen, their mounted hosts march in ever-greater numbers and with ever-better discipline. Indeed, if they are allowed to muster their forces to match their potential and given the resources to supply them, it might well become the age of the bird.\n\nThere is one critical weakness to these birds - they require a specialized feed that requires the use of cereals. Should their grain-producing lands be seized, then their forces will surely be starved out. See it done."
 Y01_winning_over_birb_title:0 "Winning Over the Shuvüüsh"
 Y01_winning_over_birb_desc:0 "No sound individual would say that the Shuvüüsh would accept us easily - indeed, to the Righteous Path we are all the foulest demons, embodying everything wrong with the world. The Shuvüüsh, an example of piety, would obviously be vehemently against our rule. Of course, all mortals might be corrupted. The rejection of the oni is not total, and that is opportunity enough to creep in."
 Y01_birb_auxillaries_title:0 "Bird Rider Auxillaries"
 Y01_birb_auxillaries_desc:0 "Patience brings success. A not insignificant amount of the Shuvüüsh have come around to our rule, swayed by security and stability - under the yoke, obviously. They contribute their dues, pay taxes, participate in state-sponsored functions, and, most importantly, have stopped trying to hide from conscription duties. A unit of Lefthand bird-riders have been prepared and armed, ready to serve as auxiliaries for our forces."
 Y01_breadbasket_north_title:0 "Breadbasket of the North"
 Y01_breadbasket_north_desc:0 "The grain-producing Shuvüüsh lands are incredibly fertile and resilient, requiring far less effort to keep the crops grown strong. With the newfound support base, it is obvious that the lands need to be exploited to their fullest. The food provided will ensure that the oni population might continue to grow even if all other sources of sustenance are snuffed out. Similarly, the increased output will allow for more soldiers to be raised."
 Y01_adapting_oni_state_title:0 "Adapting the Oni State"
 Y01_adapting_oni_state_desc:0 "The single fatal flaw of the oni is our natural isolation. Numbers notwithstanding, most tend to congregate into Shirgrii and tend to their own villages and towns, paying little regard for the affairs of others. As shown by recent successes, it is only by mixing the Shirgrii that the oni can survive. New cities, new roads, the state shall be adapted to mend these flaws. A series of new, planned cities will serve to connect the oni further than ever before."
 Y01_teimarji_spring_title:0 "The Teimarji Spring"
 Y01_teimarji_spring_desc:0 "Teimarji, a glowing blue rock which enhances an individual's magical power. When properly treated, it can do the exact opposite to great effect. However, it needs to be present to enable this - the rock only comes from the sky, and in exceedingly small amounts. Whatever can be found needs to be harvested.\n\nThe Shinukhorchi have an intrinsic link to the material, being capable of reaching out their spirits short distances to 'feel' for it. A deposit was discovered near the capital, creating springs of magically amplified water. Dig it up."
 Y01_kabiurgarko_tributary_title:0 "Kabiurgarko Tributaries"
 Y01_kabiurgarko_tributary_desc:0 "The Kabiurgarko are infamous for their greed, going to extreme lengths to preserve and grow their wealth. The most famous of their exploits was the creation of great record-keeping systems, meticulously recording all tribute extracted and from where in order to maximize their wealth intake. Naturally, that makes them a natural Shirgrii for tax collection. With the right deals, they can be brought around to utilize their skills to collect all due - and no less - from our subjects."
 Y01_golden_gates_title:0 "Golden Gates of Hokuma"
 Y01_golden_gates_desc:0 "Most people would be quick to describe themselves as pious, as righteous, as unwilling to contribute to their perceived evil. The truth of the matter is different. Cheap goods, attainable luxuries, a week's pleasure for a day's work - these are the true desires of man. Most would attest the opposite, but many would buy oni goods if they were cheap and through a merchant; for then they might pretend that what they do is righteous. Ultimately, it is all the better - for us!"
 Y01_defend_north_title:0 "Defend the North"
 Y01_defend_north_desc:0 "All other matters have simply bought time; the only defense is offense. The hobgoblins grow impatient with us, frustrated and angry at our continued sovereignty. If we were to allow the Command to have its way, the oni would be ground to dust under a legion of hobgoblin boots - but that is the delusion born of false strength. Shatter the command, show them that no discipline can stop them from being lesser! Send their broken bodies back into the mountains, never to return!"
 Y01_aikogeoke_title:0 "Aikogeoke"
 Y01_aikogeoke_desc:0 "The lands known as Aikogeoke, conveniently shaped similarly to one of our own internal provinces, have remained uncontrolled for centuries. The lands are a substantial distance from any Shirgrii, and until now none have seen anything desirable in those sparse, pastoral lands. With the world rumbling with change, this too must come to an end. Instead of any Shirgrii, the state itself shall take an interest in these lands. It shall provide a formidable border fort, and perhaps even a redoubt against any invading forces."

 flavor_azjakuma.1.a:0 "Thanks big bro!"
 flavor_azjakuma.4.t:0 "Meeting of the Tagharoghi"
 flavor_azjakuma.4.d:0 "It is time for the meeting of the Tagharoghi to decide upon a successor. The leaders of the great Shirgrii have all gathered in Shinukhorchi to present their candidate to the Rashenbir in hopes they'll be chosen as the Rashokudei, destined to become the next sovereign over all of Azjakuma. As is customary, they've also brought gifts in the form of knowledge or gold from their temple. All that is left now is for our Rashenbir to choose an apprentice."

 flavor_azjakuma.15.t:0 "An Offer of Korashi"
 flavor_azjakuma.15.d:0 "The Command is proof that, when stacked sufficiently tall, insects might still topple a house. That is, if the house is weak. Until that time that they might be toppled in war, they will need to be kept appeased./n/nThe greatest threats to their budding social order are the mages, whose spells might topple it in mere hours. We could easily keep them at bay with the oni specialty, black damestear. A trade will do well - for peace, they will receive what they need to keep their mages in check. It will only last as long as they need more, of course, but even a little time is better than none."
 flavor_azjakuma.15.a:0 "Send the Hobgoblins the Offer"
 flavor_azjakuma.15.b:0 "The Oni have withstood tides far greater than this!"
 flavor_azjakuma.16.t:0 "The Hobgoblins Accept"
 flavor_azjakuma.16.d:0 "Our diplomat has returned several handfuls of black damestear lighter, bearing instead the pleasure of good news. He has informed the higher echelons of government that the Command is pliable to such a deal - and that their envoys would be arriving shortly to discuss the specifics of delivery in person."
 flavor_azjakuma.16.a:0 "We have bought ourselves some time"
 flavor_azjakuma.17.t:0 "The Hobgoblins Reject Our Offer"
 flavor_azjakuma.17.d:0 "Our diplomat has returned bearing the full sample of black damestear we sent with him. With a stiff reluctance, he informs the Rashenbir that the Command desires no such deal. There is no incentive to prevent them from embarking on an invasion."

 flavor_azjakuma.22.t:0 "Oni Immigration to Shuvüüshudi Plains"
 flavor_azjakuma.22.d:0 "Bands of oni have, partly by incentive, partly by desire, started to migrate in significant quantities to the plains of the Shuvüüsh. As these populations grow and integrate themselves into the larger communities, it will create an easily taxable and easily recruitable base. Likewise, it will serve to help normalize the oni in the eyes of the Shuvüüsh, showing that even though they are demons, they are far from enemies."
 flavor_azjakuma.22.a:0 "This will assist with the integration of the Shuvüüsh"
 flavor_azjakuma.23.t:0 "Full Integration of the Shuvüüsh"
 flavor_azjakuma.23.d:0 "The plains-dwellers, once an example of Righteous piety, have been corrupted into compliant, productive citizens. Nearly none of them seem to recall the days when they would form hunting parties to murder oni, and if they do it holds no bearing on their judgement. They pay taxes as requested, are willing to serve in the military, and understand the oni as their betters."

 flavor_azjakuma.30.d:0 "The Khelorvalshi witchery is profound - the unique circumstances behind their formation and brotherhood have permitted their studies into regions of magic thought unspeakable even to the oni. Many such spells are affairs of the soul, involving its manipulation and even the base Chi that it manifests as.\n\nIf these dark arts are too excessive, then there is no shame in neutering their abilities... but what is the point of the Lefthand Path if not the maximization of power?"

 flavor_azjakuma.30.b:0 "Their ways are incompatible with Azjakuma, they must be restricted"
 flavor_azjakuma.31.t:0 "The Knowledge of Khelorvalshi"
 flavor_azjakuma.31.d:0 "Indeed, the things rediscovered by the Khelorvalshi are strange, terrible, and wonderful all at once - even a small sample, a token of gratitude sent in thanks for the assistance with renovations, reveals a potential for power of the most horrible sorts. There is an offer to be made - more of their Shirgrii's knowledge might be laid open for us to exploit if we might offer further assistance to their position in politics."
 flavor_azjakuma.31.a:0 "The knowledge collected by Khelorvalshi is invaluable"
 flavor_azjakuma.31.b:0 "We will not give them additional privileges"
 flavor_azjakuma.32.t:0 "The Way Forward"
 flavor_azjakuma.32.d:0 "The Rashenbir, [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazes upon the leaders of the Shirgrii. They regard him with a practiced distrust, and a wariness of one another. It disgusts him. Regardless, he begins to speak.\n\n"What will become of the oni? Of Azjakuma?" He extends a finger towards the map resting upon the table, showing the Demon Hills and its nearby conquests. "This is what we must do. The so-called "Righteous" path would exterminate us all, if we allowed them. In this, if not anything else, they are fully united. Why can the oni not say the same? In short, you are all here..."\n\nFloorboards creak from outside the meeting chamber. "...to pay your undying homage to me! You shall surrender your sovereignty to me, the Rashenbir, in perpetuity. I trust none of you hold any objections."\n\nBefore any of them can respond, [Root.Monarch.GetName] slams their fist onto the table, nearly breaking it. After a moment's delay, soldiers storm the room from every direction. Two stand behind each chief, and more aside wait by the exit. The looks on their faces are wild, surprised, shocked, outraged - the chief of the Ajgriijarul attempts to stand up, but is forced back into his seat. Yes, they are listening now. Even to the end, they are more loyal to self than Shirgrii.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] laughs, savoring their victory. "Yes, and now...""

It is such a poor situation that even these informants are harassed, and any attempts to draft Shuvüüsh are met with hostility and near-outright rebellion."
 flavor_azjakuma.2501.c:0 "To say that the efforts at integrating the Shuvüüsh are fruitless is simply false. Through continual lenience, repeated acts of token goodwill, their hostility has faded to a cautious acceptance. Though they will not easily pay taxes, and recruitment is all-but-impossible, it should speak for itself that an oni might live alongside the Shuvüüsh without being lynched."

Never again shall her walls be desecrated by the unworthy, her grounds disgraced by barbarians.
