 flavor_azjakuma.4.d:0 "It is time for the meeting of the Tagharoghi to decide upon a successor. The leaders of the great Shirgrii have all gathered in Shinukhorchi to present their candidate to the Rashenbir in hopes they'll be chosen as the Rashokudei, destined to become the next sovereign over all of Azjakuma. As is customary, they've also brought gifts in the form of knowledge or gold from their temple. All that is left now is for our Rashenbir to choose an apprentice."

 flavor_azjakuma.5.t:0 "Fall of Shinukhorchi"
 flavor_azjakuma.5.d:0 "The grandest of all the Shirgrii, Shinukhorchi has stood since time immemorial as the capital of our people. Now we must despair, for the ancient citadel has been wrested from us by our enemies, the wise sages of the temple have scattered to the countryside and the remaining Shirgrii. The future of Azjakuma appears bleak."
 flavor_azjakuma.5.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 flavor_azjakuma.6.t:0 "Fall of Chumijemoya"
 flavor_azjakuma.6.d:0 "The hidden temple of Chumijemoya has fallen, the inhabitants slaughtered as they tried to hide the secret documents and scrolls housed within. Already the survivors have joined the remaining Shirgrii, plotting the restoration of their bastion. The future of Azjakuma is uncertain."
 flavor_azjakuma.6.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 flavor_azjakuma.7.t:0 "Fall of Ajgriijarul"
 flavor_azjakuma.7.d:0 "Many armies have tried to destroy Ajgriijarul, and just as many have faltered and become just another bloodstain on its walls. Today though, the citadel has met its match. They fought with ferocity and bravery, not giving up an inch of their home without a fight. Though most of the warriors fell in battle, the few survivors have scattered throughout the countryside, angrily assaulting all that approach them. The future of Azjakuma hangs in the balance."
 flavor_azjakuma.7.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 flavor_azjakuma.8.t:0 "Fall of Kabiurgarko"
 flavor_azjakuma.8.d:0 "The shining walls of Kabiurgarko have been stained with blood as our enemies have rampages through its halls, looting its great vaults and desecrating its grounds. The few that managed to escape have flocked to their sister Shirgrii, zealously scheming the reclamation of their wealth. The future of Azjakuma is dark."
 flavor_azjakuma.8.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 flavor_azjakuma.9.t:0 "Fall of Khelorvalshi"
 flavor_azjakuma.9.d:0 "The restored Shirgrii of Khelorvalshi has fallen once again, invaders storming its blackened halls and attempting to breach into the forbidden vaults. The Oni within the temple seem to have vanished, disappearing without a trace as the gates were blown open. Wherever they went, their taboo wisdom is no longer at our disposal. The future of Azjakuma is unknown."
 flavor_azjakuma.9.a:0 "Josmuk!"
 flavor_azjakuma.10.t:0 "Shinukhorchi Restored"
 flavor_azjakuma.10.d:0 "In a grand battle that will surely be remembered for eternity, our fallen capital of Shinukhorchi has finally been reclaimed. Never again shall her walls be desecrated by the unworthy, her grounds disgraced by barbarians. Already the sages and monks that were forced to flee have returned to the citadel, and damned be us all should it fall again."
 flavor_azjakuma.10.a:0 "May her fires never be snuffed again!"
 flavor_azjakuma.11.t:0 "Chumijemoya Restored"
 flavor_azjakuma.11.d:0 "Thanks in no small part to the plotting and plans of her rightful inhabitants, the hidden temple of Chumijemoya has been pried from the hands of our enemies. The damage from the battle is already being repaired as the temple's inhabitants take stock of the scrolls housed within, destroying any that may have been read by the occupiers."
 flavor_azjakuma.11.a:0 "Hopefully it won't take too long."
 flavor_azjakuma.12.t:0 "Ajgriijarul Restored"
 flavor_azjakuma.12.d:0 "The moment the gates were opened, they appeared from the mists, the enraged warriors of Ajriijarul. Shoving past our armies they tore into their restored home, eager to seek revenge on those that stole it from them. They may be busy for quite some time, and the citadel will surely need cleaning, but at long last we have regained the Shirgrii."
 flavor_azjakuma.12.a:0 "They'll settle down eventually."
 flavor_azjakuma.13.t:0 "Kabiurgarko Restored"
 flavor_azjakuma.13.d:0 "Across Azjakuma are celebrations as the golden gates of Kabiurgarko lay within our hands once again. Assisted by human agents within the citadel, our armied took it with minimal damage to the structure, much to the delight of the inhabitants that have swiftly returned to their vast stashes of wealth."
 flavor_azjakuma.13.a:0 "Let the gold flow!"
 flavor_azjakuma.14.t:0 "Khelorvalshi Restored"
 flavor_azjakuma.14.d:0 "When we stormed back into Khelorvalshi we were expecting an occupying force. Instead we were met with the original Oni inhabitants, carrying on as if nothing had happened and claiming that they had always been there. Whatever the case, the secrets of Khelorvalshi are now ours once again."
 flavor_azjakuma.14.a:0 "I have many questions."
