 #Alchemy
 flavor_huljorkad.2.title:0 "Recovering what was lost"
 flavor_huljorkad.2.desc:0 "Hul-Jorkad used to have access to some of the purest metal known to dwarfkind, and even beyond in the lands of man. Through alchemical expertise the hold was able even to purify the notoriously toxic lead that the hold was known for. And today, we have replicated this feat. Our alchemists excitedly report that they have made a new form of lead completely free of impurities and toxins, additionally it is magically enhanced to even remove toxins already present in the water flowing through it! It may not be exactly what our Forefathers had, but it is a step in the right direction."
 flavor_huljorkad.2.a:0 "The first step will be the easiest"
 flavor_huljorkad.3.title:0 "Kronium, Dagrite, and Adamantite"
 flavor_huljorkad.3.desc:0 "Not only can we purify lead, but Iron, and Copper. Even alloys such as Steel, and stronger metals such as Mithril are not beyond the abilities of our alchemists. There can always be improvement however. Rarer metals such as Dagrite, Kronium, and Adamantite are all proving difficult to alchemically modify. We must endeavor to focus on these projects, and surpass the skills of all alchemists to come before."
 flavor_huljorkad.3.a:0 "Now, where to start?"
 
 #Kronium Research
 flavor_huljorkad.4.title:0 "Kronium Research"
 flavor_huljorkad.4.desc:0 "Stuff about Kronium"
 flavor_huljorkad.4.a:0 "Begin Kronium research"
 flavor_huljorkad.4.b:0 "Not now"
 flavor_huljorkad.5.title:0 "Hitting a snag"
 flavor_huljorkad.5.desc:0 "Research has been slow, but progress has been made. Unfortunately, it's been mostly theoretical, as we have no actual Kronium to work with. Kronium is an incredibly rare artificially made metal, and it's only known usage in the days of Aul-Dwarov was the Dwarovkron. Which we dare not use for research. Two options lay in front of us, attempt to synthesize our own without a test sample, or fund an expedition with the distinct purpose of finding Kronium relics."
 flavor_huljorkad.5.a:0 "Attempt to synthesize our own Kronium"
 flavor_huljorkad.5.b:0 "Fund the expedition"
 flavor_huljorkad.6.title:0 "Failure"
 flavor_huljorkad.6.desc:0 "Utter failure. That is all our alchemists have suffered. Not a hint of success in producing Kronium. Even following exact recipes left behind by Aul-Dwarov. There seems to be something we are missing, something that was not passed down in writing. The Dwarovkron remains the only piece of Kronium in the known world."
 flavor_huljorkad.6.a:0 "Dissapointing, but we must endure to discover something."
 flavor_huljorkad.7.title:0 "Nothing but dust"
 flavor_huljorkad.7.desc:0 "The expedition we sent has returned with nothing in hand but dust and worthless relics. Nothing matching the true weight and density of Kronium has been found in any of the ruins and hold depths they explored. Not even evidence of failed experiments to create the metal. Truly the weigh ot the Dwarovkron is unmatched by all, and it remains the only Kronium in the world."
 flavor_huljorkad.7.a:0 "We cannot be dissuaded. We must find something!"
 flavor_huljorkad.8.title:0 "Kronium Knowledge"
 flavor_huljorkad.8.desc:0 "Kronium is the densest metal known to civilization, and was uniquely made during the days of Aul-Dwarov to create the Dwarovkron. The Crown that would lay atop the head of the High King. Made so that 'whomever rules all dwarves knows the weight of their actions'. We have failed to replicate this metal, or find any trace of other Kronium artifacts. However, it is clear the process of creation is not purely metallurgical or alchemical. Something is missing, something that we can't access. Nonetheless, the insights granted by this research have increased our understanding of alchemy as a whole. We may have failed here, but this knowledge will benefit the nation as a whole."
 flavor_huljorkad.8.a:0 "Perhaps future Lead Dwarves will rediscover this secret"
 
 #Dagrite Research
 flavor_huljorkad.9.title:0 "Dagrite Research"
 flavor_huljorkad.9.desc:0 "Stuff about Dagrite"
 flavor_huljorkad.9.a:0 "Begin Dagrite research"
 flavor_huljorkad.9.b:0 "Not now"
 flavor_huljorkad.10.title:0 "Electric Developments"
 flavor_huljorkad.10.desc:0 "Research has been relatively easy, as even though Dagrite is naturally rare within the mines of the Serpentspine. The rails that span its entirety are made almost entirely of the rare metal! However, that does not mean progress is smooth. While we know that electricity causes Dagrite to naturally repair itself, our alchemists are struggling to find out why or how. Our head alchemist has approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] with two possible courses of action that may reveal to us this secret. Temporarily close our borders so our alchemists can perform a large scale experiment on all rails within our nation, or fund an expedition into the depths of the hold, where it is known a rather large railstation is present."
 flavor_huljorkad.10.a:0 "Cordon off our borders, alchemy waits for no one"
 flavor_huljorkad.10.b:0 "Get to the railworks, close it to the public. Our Alchemists will have their research"
 flavor_huljorkad.11.title:0 "Dagrite Knowledge"
 flavor_huljorkad.11.desc:0 "Our alchemists have yet to fully grasp the full extent of Dagrite, and knowledge on it's function will take time to grow and mature. Dagrite not only repairs itself as electricity is run through it, but also uniquely effects other ferro-magnetic metals around it while it is conducting. This discovery, while not exactly what we were looking for, is still progress. And our alchemists are redoubling efforts to truly understand the function behind it's unique mending property."
 flavor_huljorkad.11.a:0 "Our knowledge expands"
 
 #Adamantite Research
 flavor_huljorkad.12.title:0 "Adamantite Research"
 flavor_huljorkad.12.desc:0 "Stuff about Adamantite"
 flavor_huljorkad.12.a:0 "Begin Adamantite research"
 flavor_huljorkad.12.b:0 "Not now"
 flavor_huljorkad.13.title:0 "Sharpened dealings"
 flavor_huljorkad.13.desc:0 "Adamantite research has been coming along nicely. Our alchemists marvel at it's hardness, however this exact hardness makes it incredibly difficult to realistically forge weapons and armor out of it for entire armies compared to Mithril. Not to mention it's incredible rarity. Less common than Mithril and even Dagrite, mass extraction is nearly impossible. However, a more militaristically inclined alchemist has approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a proposal. Field testing Adamantite weapons and armor of his own design should grant our armies a temporary edge, while also allowing us to discover the true properties of this hard metal. However, our state alchemists stand against him, proclaiming that with time and effort they'll be able to produce the same results in half the time... and some extra funding of course"
 flavor_huljorkad.13.a:0 "Adamant armor? I like the ring of it"
 flavor_huljorkad.13.b:0 "Grant the funding, we seek knowledge not war"
 flavor_huljorkad.14.title:0 "Adamantite Knowledge"
 flavor_huljorkad.14.desc:0 "Adamantite is known as the hardest metal in the world, and for good reason. Our alchemists have been struggling to find a way to make adamantite more malleable for actual use. And their genius shines through, by processing adamantite through various alchemical processes that temporarily weaken the nigh-impenetrable metal it becomes forgeable. With this knowledge our armies will no doubt strike fear into any oncoming threat. Adamant armor, adamant knowledge, adamant Jorkad."
 flavor_huljorkad.14.a:0 "Our knowledge expands"
 
 #Golden History
 flavor_huljorkad.15.title:0 "A Tarnished History"
 flavor_huljorkad.15.desc:0 "Lead Dwarves have a very distinct history with gold. It is well known throughout the dwarovar, even before it's recovery, that Hul-Jorkad was the first hold to fall to the Orcs. And it's reasons have remained mysterious, until we delved into the forgotten and ruined libraries of Hul-Jorkad. Gold was the reason our hold fell. It is public knowledge, and has been since the day it was discovered. Since then, every Lead Dwarf has viewed gold with suspicion. When the Orcs first emerged from the Dwarovar, our hold was unprepared. Our king having been afflicted by the Hoardcurse after single-mindedly pursuing the alchemical recipe of lead to gold. Had he not spent so much on this pursuit, and drained finances from defense and military. The Orcs may have been stopped before they could even begin to march across the Dwarovar. We must endeavor to never let something such as this happen again. We are Lead Dwarves, not the corrupt Golden Dwarves that call Verkal Gulan home. We must endeavor to rectify the mistake of our past, and remove ourselves of the golden taint. We will not attempt to turn lead into gold as so many before us have, no, we will turn gold into lead."
 flavor_huljorkad.15.a:0 "Our honor relies on this"
 flavor_huljorkad.16.title:0 "Complainers, through and through"
 flavor_huljorkad.16.desc:0 "Already, less than a month after making the decision to pursue gold to lead transmutation, we have received delegations from dwarves across the Serpentspine and beyond urging us to reconsider. We will not, but perhaps we can assuage their concerns."
 flavor_huljorkad.16.a:0 "Show them the process so that they can understand we mean this for the benefit of the Serpentspine"
 flavor_huljorkad.16.b:0 "They are greedy fools, their concerns are unfounded."
 flavor_huljorkad.17.title:0 "Damnable Bureaucrats"
 flavor_huljorkad.17.desc:0 "It was a mistake to let other nations supervise our process of transmuting Gold to Lead. It started as innane questions that simply bothered our Alchemists. But today it turned into absolute sabotage. Multiple of our alchemists fell into greed and were paid off by other nations to lead our development astray. It will take a long time to get things back in order, and perhaps even longer to reach our goal."
 flavor_huljorkad.17.a:0 "Damnit all! Does the Hoardcurse already touch their minds?"
 flavor_huljorkad.18.title:0 "A corrupted mind"
 flavor_huljorkad.18.desc:0 "Something about Alchemist losing their mind to the Hoardcurse and defecting"
 flavor_huljorkad.18.a:0 "The Hoardcurse reaches deep. We must fight this!"
 flavor_huljorkad.19.title:0 "Success"
 flavor_huljorkad.19.desc:0 "Something about how we successfully permanently transmuted gold into lead. A more difficult undertaking than we imagined."
 flavor_huljorkad.19.a:0 "Yay"
 
 #Second Vale
 flavor_huljorkad.21.title:0 "Harpylen Vale Irrigation"
 flavor_huljorkad.21.desc:0 "Knowledge of the Serpents Vale is well known throughout the Dwarovar, it is also known that with the rise of the Orcs and the fall of Hul-Jorkad many holds were cut off from the food supplies of the Vale. The Harpylen valley has the unique geography that will allow us to replicate the Serpents Vale's irrigation systems here."

 flavor_huljorkad.22.a:0 "Food for our people!"
 flavor_huljorkad.23.title:0 "The Hul-Jorkad Granary"
 flavor_huljorkad.23.desc:0 "With this Second Vale completed, we can not only feed our people. But act as a second capital of the Serpentspine!"
 flavor_huljorkad.23.a:0 "He who controls the food, controls the Dwarovar"
 
 #Pressure Mining
 flavor_huljorkad.24.title:0 "Water Pressure Mining"
 flavor_huljorkad.24.desc:0 "Water is a powerful force. Over thousands of years it can erode away entire mountains. Truly a testament to the power and patience of nature. We dwarves are not so different, spending hundreds of years to create enourmous underground cities. With the creation of the Hapylen Dam, we've discovered that focused, water can cut through even metal and stone. We can rather easily set up pipes specialized to this function, and ensure our mines are of the highest efficiency."
 flavor_huljorkad.24.a:0 "Create Azmak Quarry Pressure Mines"
 flavor_huljorkad.24.b:0 "Create Travelers Refuge Pressure Mines"

 flavor_huljorkad.25.title:0 "Water Pressure Mine created"
 flavor_huljorkad.25.desc:0 "We have succesfully established the infrastructure to utilize pressurized water to mine here"
 flavor_huljorkad.25.a:0 "Precious metals and gems reveal themselves!"
 flavor_huljorkad.26.title:0 "Pressure on the Spine"
 flavor_huljorkad.26.desc:0 "Completion of this water pressure mining has enabled us to extract more metals than ever before. This will no doubt grant us the materials needed to pursue more projects!"
 flavor_huljorkad.26.a:0 "Rivers of metal flow out of the Serpentspine!"
 
 #Alchemy Workshop
 flavor_huljorkad.27.title:0 "Workshop Complete"
 flavor_huljorkad.27.desc:0 "Gold is now being transmuted on a massive scale in Verkal Gulan."
