 rediscover_ebonforging_desc:0 "Since Elkaesal blanketed Gerudia in the all-ending winter of the Era of Frost, the art of forging Ebonsteel has all been dormant. A dark metal with a slight sheen of the deepest of purples, Ebonsteel was admired by our ancestors for its wondrous property: a magical barrier that can repel fast-moving objects with ease! Once the great Ebonsteel Forge in Urviksten ran hot, but was extinguished by the betrayal of the last great Ebonfrost, Urvic, upon his return. In Blodfjell, the old Ebonsteel forges remain, yet have not seen neither or nor a smith who can operate it in centuries.\n\nUntil now. The Skalds have pondered over the origins of the Ebonsteel artifacts, and their magical properties, and have come to a conclusion: it was once crafted with the conjunction of the master smith and skald working together. The Skalds have prepared a list of songs and litanies to work the metal, however it is not only their input that is needed. Scholars have studied the treacherous mountains and steep valleys of Gerudia, looking for where Ebonsteel may be found. Should we but provide them the funds to the skalds and scholars, we may find a practical revival to the art of Ebonforging!"

 ehnance_ebonsteel_regiments_desc:0 "While the art of forging Ebonsteel is practiced throughout Gerudia since its restoration, until now the magic enchanted onto the metal has been only rudimentary compared to the marvels of the ancients. It is to be expected that the Ebonsteel forged for our armies would be of lower quality than that of mastercrafted weapons of legends. But what if we can unlock the greater repellant magical properties in far less time and effort than is required for a masterwork? By Skald, artificer, scholar, or even mad-witch, no expense should be spared to unlock Ebonsteels true potential!"
