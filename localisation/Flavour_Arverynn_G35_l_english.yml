 pomentere_estates_desc:0 "We have long employed various warriors, adventurers, and fortune seekers in our armies as Pomentere, to supplement our trueborn Ynnic sons. Now that the Veykodan Guard is the core of our army, we need to ensure that we can always have a good stock of Veykodan warriors to recruit. We will grant veterans of our wars estates in the new lands we reconquer, where they can prosper within Ynnic society."
 buycev_policy_title:0 "Buycev Policy"
 buycev_policy_desc:0 "Our policy of employing Veykodan Buycev, while largely successful in allowing us to rein in the petty lords who have claimed to rule our lands, has seen Veykodan power grow substantially, and should we not control and reward them adequately, we run the risk of losing all our gains. By ensuring constant victories in which we can hand out the spoils of wealth, we can make sure they don’t turn against us."
 veykodan_guard_title:0 "Veykodan Guard"
 veykodan_guard_desc:0 "So far, our recruits have been made up of strong, individual warriors seeking to make a name for themselves by fighting for the righteous Ynnic emperors. However, our recent successes have left us with vast lands no longer controlled by petty lords. We will hand these out to Veykodan veterans and families, encourage them to adopt our faith and create families to ensure that the next generations of emperor have a loyal and capable Veykodan Guard."

Knights have for centuries formed the solution to beastly  problems along the Ynn, but lest their power grow even more, let us turn instead to an even older tradition: rangers, patrolling the land for any signs of trouble, ready to hunt down even the scariest beasts.\n\nThe Tromseloc Way will receive a formal and organised force of rangers, based in nearby Thromshana. The Thromshana Rangers will make use of the finest steeds of the Thromshana ranch, a specialised smaller breed excellent for the roughlands the Tromseloc Way winds through."

Seizing it will not be easy, but we have the element of surprise on our side.\n\nOnce this vital crossing is secured, all of Dolindha will be within reach of reclamation, and not even the Bridge Wardens can stop us from doing so!"

Now, Vareynn stands as a testament to the tragedy of the dark ages.\n\nReduced to a mere town, it is not even the true capital of its own state: that honour goes to the castle of Vareynn Amac in its countryside, while the imperial capital with its wide streets and its arched pathways and its half-finished hippodrome is left to decay when not outright pillaged for stone. We did what Vareynn’s petty lords could not, and now it is time to incorporate the original capital of the empire back into our realm."

 veykodan_rune_warriors_title:0 "Veykodan Rune Warriors"
 veykodan_rune_warriors_desc:0 "Our recent defeat dealt by the petty lord Alaran has highlighted the flaws in our army, and there are many. Our forces, once strong enough to defend the entire empire, now are barely able to man the walls of Arverynn and are more of a militia than a true army. The loss of the keep of Arvezl leaves few Ynnic knights under our command, the Thromshana Ranch alone being not nearly enough to raise a strong core to rebuild our army with.\n\nCarodin II has instead proposed a radical alternative, an army based around the Veykodans of the east. Their rune magic makes them formidable adversaries, and their exotic sabretooth and woolly rhino mounts are almost able to compete with the mighty antler horses. While we have always employed small bands of Veykodans here and there, it is time to make them a true part of our army."

 seize_the_imperial_palace_desc:0 "In 674 emperor Darastarad I moved the imperial court to Stanyrhrada due to his love for the weather and countryside, where it stayed as the capital for two centuries. Its palace, once a beacon of our imperial might, has since been refitted into a castle which is the base of power of the yen Stantir, a cadet branch of the imperial dynasty.\n\nWhile we now rule from Arverynn and have no desire to move our court, they do not have the prestige of the Vyrekynn, and, should Stanyrhrada’s feudatories grow over-ambitious, their home would make a fantastic summer palace."

While the first evolved into a city and the second into a castle, both keep acting as primary fortifications from which the approaches into Sarda are guarded; we should ensure that they are well kept and manned by fine soldiers."

Some of the more far-out lordlings in Selocshana and Vels Fadhecai may yet see it differently, but it is only a matter of time before they too are brought back into the imperial fold.\n\nSo let us rule: two centuries of petty lords and betrayals have left Sarda without purpose or loyalty, yet they could not undo the legacy of the Ynnic Empire, which merely needs to be re-learned. To facilitate this process, grand councils will be hosted, with banquets so sumptuous and performances so dazzling that even the haughtiest nobles will not miss out on them. In a decade or two under our reign, all of Sarda will surely see the Greatness of House Vyrekynn."

If we are to reassert control over this region, the banners of the imperial house must fly over this entrypoint once more."

 vanquich_the_battlekings_desc:0 "It is one thing to be upstarts, to forsake the Empire that nurtured you and protected you in favour of a new system of governance known as feudalism. It is pure madness however, to do what Lord Galadorn yen Ceped did, and launch a rebellion to restore a kingdom that exhausted its purpose over a millennium ago.\n\nMalacnar's new battlekings seek to upend the social order of the Ynn and value nothing but brute force, which fits more an apocalyptic wasteland than it does a proper empire. While we have often employed the Malacnar Battleguards and they have proven to be loyal and competent when paid well, the battlekingdom must be brought down and reincorporated into our empire."

 knights_of_the_bush_desc:0 "The Knights of the Bush have been steadfast defenders of the Ynn: not only do they guard the northern border against Old Rzentur clan-warriors who covet Ynnic lands, they have also organized the coalition that repelled the Drozma Tur invasion of 1367, leading to Drozmagog’s death and the final avenging of the Great Fire of Arverynn.\n\nThe Hedge Gardens of Grebniesth and their nobles’ flowery language stand out like a vibrant rose in the rugged thorn-bush that is Dolindha. Their style and grace would be a great addition to our court in the Teal Keep, but will do them no good against our rightful might."

From Vysamsto the High City to Adbrabohvi by the edge of the world, the imperial banners of the Teal Crest and the Vermillion Steed fly in every city, if they can be truly called cities in the same vein as Arverynn.\n\nLike our beautiful Arverynn needed decades of love and care to flourish into the city it was before the Age of the Petty Lords, generations will pass before Vareynn and Vysamsto are to be truly called jewels. Greatness will have to wait for Order, as we continue the process of Strengthening our ties with our utmost loyal vassals, settling the matter of unitary policies for them all.\n\nBy the end of it, our power will be an insurmountable crashing wave, with the Strength to drown nations, but also birth new life and grow prosperity like never before. We will see an Empire reunited, a religion reformed, and a dynasty reinstated.\n\nIt is good to be Emperors."

While Calrodiy IV brought hope and our Great dynasty back to this realm, and with it a semblance of Order, he also achieved little in the ways of Strength, his biggest “achievement” saving our city by nearly bankrupting our country with bribes to Alaran of Trompolere. Carodin II however, has magnificent plans with which we will start our reconquest of the empire. A True Vyrekynn, for the True Empire."

Once we defeat Alaran, the petty lords that rule Horpanas and Filimir of Arvezl will swear fealty to us once more, and our resurgence can begin."

 rightful_rulers_of_sarda_desc:0 "We are the rightful rulers of all the Ynn! But perhaps ensuring that the lords of Sarda are loyal first is wise. Once we rein in some initial fiefdoms, the rest will surely follow. Adbrabohvi especially favours our rule, praising our incorporation of Veykodans, and should we prove our might and legitimate rule, surely they will bow for us."

 arverynnic_rennaisance_desc:0 "The Teal Keep stands as an impregnable fortress manned by imposing knights, steadfast soldiers, and devoted servants. Yet it used to be so much more: a resplendent house it was, where philosophers, artists and academics from all Ynn could gather for merriment as they honed their talent to let it improve the land.\n\nThe Emperor has already resolved to become one of the largest sponsors of patronage and several enterprising traders have followed this example. The court at the Teal Keep needs to experience a true rebirth if it is ever to become worthy of standing beside imperial Arverynn's pedestal, and not just in its shadow."

The region rose up in rebellion during the Third Ynnic Civil War, led by the traitorous Lord Trantan, who was in turn overthrown by the Dragon Cult’s rebellion, and the rest is history.\n\nNow it is time to rein them back in, and turn them into loyal subjects of the Empire once more."

Not only are they trained individuals, they are loyal to the crown, and not tied to the local lands. We should increase the number of functionaries and support them in their efforts to rein in local lords so that we can continue to administer more land directly."

To combat this, we will enact a monetary reform, and turn to Vels Domfan: its Green-Gold Mint is within our grasp, and the coins it produces, being made of a glass encasing and a thin strip of gold, would be the Empire's perfect currency, beautiful and cheap in materials."

He proposed that the new land east of Vareynn be distributed one third to Vareynn's lower classes, one sixth to Stantirshalan nobles and to Bostynn's archers each, and the final third to Vareynn's King and his riders.\n\nGeneral Varamit became furious, accusing Rolatan of being a Cursed One sympathizer for giving so little land to the true victors of the campaign. Rolatan retracted, increasing the Riders' land share to half. This was seen as a bribe attempt and the Assembly was now calling for Rolatan's trial. Only when King Ivranvit stood up and spoke, they were persuaded to end their line of accusation. This was the first and last time in Ynnic history where the topic of land reform didn't result in bloodshed."\n\n-Civil War, Telnik yen Mocvas, Ynnic Historian, 627"

Will these Krarhnorians willingly join our fold, letting the Emperor shepherd them and guard the borders of their pastures? Will they endure a hundred military campaigns, protecting their far-out towns and beautiful forest lodges with a rifle in every bush?\n\nYnn River watch us, for whether by Strength or Greatness, we are going to bring Order to Veykoda!"

The tenacity of Cannorian homesteaders and the fury of Veykodan magic could not withstand the tides of our imperial battalions, just like their hearts of rugged stone were moved to reason by the Teal Crest’s gentle sway.\n\nMore can still be done to ease the tensions, yet a trickle of trade, migration - and most importantly, tribute - has been established between our three peoples. This trickle can become a torrent once we clear out the waterways and build more markets and river-docks, our city sure to become the one true entrepot into the Pansvovych.\n\nAt the same time, Arverynn must remain a shield, a dam that can filter out the poisonous religions of barbarians and Cannorians lest this refreshing current of change turns into a crashing wave of mud."

How can we, when our troops' current pay leaves them shy of even the fish jumping out of the River? It appears we will need to call forth one more sacrifice, for the good of Arverynn and the realm.\n\nOnly, let us be wary: many were the sacrifices Lord Calrodiy IV asked of his populace and friends during his rulership, and should this be for nothing one more time, the consequences will be much graver than a simply disgruntled populace."

The market square will be renewed, and we will offer audience to the mayor to listen to what the town needs to prosper, whether it be a new road or a new militia.\n\nNaturally, this will lead to a closer cooperation, as imperial functionaries move to and from Thromshana to oversee the works, understating that our states are one and the same and ending any 'Free City' nonsense."

The banks of the Moon Field, northeast of Arverynn, offer one such swathe of fertile land waiting to be tilled by farmers, so long as we can offer them protection. The same can be said about the vineyards of Horpanas, which can be renewed and expanded through alliances with the right landholders.\n\nAll around the city of Arverynn, a vast fertile plain will be painted in the colours of grain and vegetables, and filled with the calls of animals and the amiable chatter of farmer's markets.

An unwritten collection of rules and customs dictated the interactions between farmers and hunters, helping settle their disputes over game, wild crops and land ownership since ancient times. These norms were then put to law by Ynnic emperors, who tweaked them from time to time as necessity demanded.\n\nNow that our agrarian economy is a source of pride among Ynnics, attracting the interest of traders and Buyovec alike, we can re-visit these laws and organize them into a single extensive code: Zalagon Pananek, or Farmer's Law.

Our ever-increasing army will enjoy the additional quarters, our brilliant courtiers will marvel at the new talents within the kitchen staff, our generals will stand atop the new walls confident in the artillery-resistant runic magic, visiting nobles will find immaculate bedrooms featuring swan feather pillows that put even our most powerful Iosahar to shame.\n\nAnd all around the people of the Lower City will relish the bulwark of our power, upwards they will gaze and be awed, an array of towers and suspended walkways leading their mind and attention to the Teal Keep up high on Vyrisar Hill."

Our most cautious advisors are even suggesting that Krarhnorians make no difference between Buycev and Ynnics, seeing both as "natives" who need to be exterminated for the glory of their nations, and that once they are done with Veykoda, we will be next.\n\nA laughable thought, for sure!

 radavezyr_desc:0 "Historically, the emperors at Arverynn projected influence over Veykoda with a light touch, keeping Cannorian homesteaders cooperative. Veykodan natives were supported at times, like when in 1724 Emperor Trandir II sent a unit of Teira Manhunters to put an end to the Ivory Wars between New Havoral and the Osindain tribes, however nativism never figured among the Teal Keep's public objectives.\n\nNo imperial army marched east to rescue their fellow Ruinborn, and the vassal kingdom of Veykoda was only established through an unlikely series of events that Corinsfield's invasion set in motion.\n\nHowever, if things had gone differently, if Arverynn's rise had been faster and its grip on Sarda tighter, surely an Emperor would have rewarded the services of the Veykodan Guard by riding east, carving out a faithful client kingdom and bestowing a crown to one of their own so that they too could be King of the Castle, right?"

How was he meant to recognize them, now that their vibrant tattoos were hidden by layers of plain cloth? But he recognized their voices, and the runic patterns on their faces and hands. “Szannem! Sronzar! At least they don't force you to wear knights' helmets, huh?" He joked, expecting a laugh from his old friends, even now that they were captains of the Veykodan Guard. And laugh they did, and the three spoke for hours.\n\n“…What do you mean you're not coming back?" Rapanach asked, suddenly taken off-guard. “Surely, you must have big plans. Retire and found a Veykodan kingdom of your own, finally get rid of the emperor and sack this city, grab a souvenir to bring back to your tribe, or anything else…"\n\nSzannem sternly replied: “Rapanach, the only thing we plan is a comfortable retirement, settling the lands the Emperor has promised us with our families and friends."\n\nRapanach froze for a moment, his old friend's voice was without a hint of sarcasm. “What about our people?!" Rapanach croaked. “Rapanach, I'm sorry…" Sronzar intervened, glancing at his fellow Veykodan mercenaries and the Sarda peasants traversing the road. “This is our people now, and if you continue committing sedition… you might be arrested."\n\nSedition?!?

While smaller, younger houses such as the yen Cestor and the Ralsork of Arvezl submitted relatively easily, the great houses of Stanyrhrada, Stenurynn, and most infamously Vels Bacar skillfully defended their fiefdoms from any notion of imperial encroachment. Emperors would sometime provoke them into open rebellion, counting on their own victory and the possibility to confiscate lands as a punishment; other times they incited lesser barons to revolt against powerful lords, helping them break free and placing them under Arverynn's direct vassalage.\n\nOn the public record, the monarchs of Arverynn championed the little aristocracy. Land was taken from the larger Ynnic lords and distributed into smaller holdings, which were then organized under lesser houses who were receptive to Arverynn's functionaries. By the time of Calrodiy V, this was the organization of all the land along the Arverynn river, and it provided a reliable trickle of foot soldiers, such as River Wardens and Colzeny Bow archers, to bolster imperial armies."

 string_start_Arverynn:0 "§g\"Take me back to the Northward River, as I sing a song; a floating rhyme rippling through time towards the City of Forever."\n-To the Garrisons' opening verse, Talvyr yen Arkilodo, Sarda Poet.§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\n§YArverynn§!, Jewel of the Ynn, City of Emperors, Mound-Fortress: these and many more titles echo across the art and memories of §YYnnic Ruinborn§!. Founded in 900 after Flood by the Soldier-Emperor §YCalrodiy the Great§!, first of his name, Arverynn shone as a brand-new beacon of civilization at a time when the majority of elvenkind was living at sea or surrounded by ruins.\n\nAs beautiful as it was impregnable, only the perverted actions of the dragon §YDrozmagog§! and his cultists could hope to strike at the imperial capital, and even that didn't last - the damage inflicted by the §YGreat Fire of Arverynn§! in 1028 was quickly undone through a mobilization of the §YYnnic Empire§!.\n\nThe §YThird Ynnic Civil War§! saw the dissolution of the Ynnic Empire and the ruin of its urban centers; despite this, Arverynn's ruin did not come from an outside conqueror, but from within, when in 1205 after Flood a famished mob lynched Emperor §YFineas Vyrekynn§!. A most foul event, which spelled the end of Calrodiy's line and of the Ynnic Empire. Or so people thought…\n\n§ORecent History§!\nArverynnics have a name for the 13th and 14th centuries: the §YAge of Petty Lords§!. A string of minor nobles ruled the great city, trying to manage its §Yshrinking populace§! while fighting off economic decline, the odd rabble-rousing preacher and the schemes of their own court. Some of these rulers appealed to Arverynn's prestige, but they struggled subduing §YStanyrhrada§! or keeping the §YVeykodan§! raiders at bay. Reuniting §YSarda§!, let alone the whole Empire, seemed a pipe dream, the Lordship of Arverynn was destined to become a backwater, eclipsed by the feudal §YDolindhan§! powers of §YAmaceped§! and §YAmacimst§! and by the nearby §YVels Bacar§!…\n\nThen in 1386, the Emperor returned. §YCalrodiy IV§! announced himself as the last scion of the §YVyrekynn§! dynasty, as he emerged from the horizon at the head of a company of shining knights and mercenaries. The petty lord who was occupying Arverynn did not dare resist him, disappearing into the night as his name was forgotten by history. The city celebrated Calrodiy as a liberator, and he returned this warmth with weeks of festivities. However, this victory would be Calrodiy's first and last.\n\nThe aspiring emperor overestimated his neighbours' willingness to submit to him and rejoin the glorious empire, losing the chance for peaceful reunification with his diplomatic blunders. His lavish festivities put a dent in the coffers, and he alienated even his closest supporters, first through unrealistic and insistent demands, like when he asked the captain of his knights to “tell his soldiers to bring better armour for tomorrow's battle", then by becoming cruel as his frustrations grew. In 1444, Calrodiy IV has one foot in the grave, his defeat against the young §YAlaran§! of §YTrompolere§! still bleeding him of his pride.\n\nDespite these circumstances, it is not our lot to despair. The lives of Ynnic elves are short, and their wisdom fallible. But there is no doubt in the mind of the citizens that we are primed for greatness, that §Tno matter how deep we sink§! or how violently the earth trembles, §Twe will emerge§! and thrive. Arverynn is 500 years old: an impressive age, if this were a Veykodan hamlet. For the capital of the §YYnn§! ten thousand years would not suffice, so let us move on, for there is much to live for and much to be done, as long as the Ynn wills it."

 rebuild_tromseloc_way_desc:0 "During the fall of the Ynnic Empire in the 12th and 13th centuries, more and more troops were recalled to fight in the civil wars, including those that guarded the Tromseloc Way, the eastern land route connecting Thromshana to Bosancovac. All villages along this way were eventually abandoned due to a resurgence in Wendigos and Veykodan raids.\n\nNow that we prepare to restore order and emerge from the Dark Ages, rebuilding the Tromseloc Way will open up a vital connection between Dolindha and Sarda. We will send parties to clear out ruined waystations before our engineers can repair them or build new ones from scratch, paths will need to be beaten again, and communities will need plenty encouragement to move in; we will no doubt face stiff resistance from Veykodan tribes, or worse still, ambushes by wendigos hiding among the trees and ruins, which is why our efforts must be carried out with the maximum alert."

Acting as the Emperor’s hands, eyes, and ears outside the city, they have a keen sense for opportunities to help our realm, and opportunities to make projects grander and fancier than they need to be, so that great funding flows into them and part of it can be inconspicuously skimmed off."
