 g27_brelari_endurance_desc:0 "In the peaks and the valleys, the air is thin, and the breath grows strong. By clambering up steep ridge and down mossy gully the legs and back grow thick. For these traits which the Argan mountains grant us, for unwavering stamina and broad-backed, grey-haired, gruff-toned soldiers Brelar is known in Dolindha…"

 g27_iron_elves_desc:0 "...by these plainsfolks we are sometimes nicknamed "Zelenairod" the Ironfolk, and ere since the misty days of the Ride of Lukaus their proud Antler Lords here have been felled by swift step with sturdy spear, and repelled by hardy backs in cold chainmail guarded. Thus it has been, and thus by bright forge and by harsh training, we will ensure it remains."

 g27_argan_ironhouses_desc:0 "The Border Mountains are the only true peaks in the Ynn River Valley, here the forests of the north are cloven in twain, separating the fey lands of western Rzenta from the eerie Cursed East. Here is also the largest iron deposit in the river valley, that since ancient times has granted us might to win fearsome battle and inspiration for wondrous craft. For a thousand years, there have been Ironhouses at work, forging ever diligent in the dales of Brelar, yet since the fall of the Empire their numbers wane, and the number of iron mines also. This must not be allowed to continue, though the cost for us will be great in these days of decay we must pool the efforts of the republic into reinvigoration, that the Ironhouses may last a thousand years more."

 g27_restart_mills_desc:0 "It is well and good that our mines are in use, and our Ironhouses ringing, yet to further their continued prosperity the iron must be sold in greater quantities. We know, however, that few shall brave to journey here in this dark age so we shall strike out from here with our own caravans instead, and we shall build palisades and watchtowers to secure the roads that in time others shall follow. For this we need carts, soldiers and boats, for this the Brelynn shall again churn a hundred watermills in Brelar, that the saws of marble and wood, and the bilges of iron, shall grant us the resources we need."

 g27_marbelous_infrastructure_desc:0 "Brelar now prospers as few places have since the fall of the Yrisars. Since idleness does not become those with less weight to carry, it is now the time to construct works. Not so great as of old perhaps, but firm and functional reinforced in grey Brelari marble, for things built by the Ironfolk with such materials do not wither easily. Roads, aqueducts, dikes, walls and gatehouses the marbleworks of Brelar shall give to the republic and to Dolindha."

 g27_steel_city_desc:0 "The City of Warriors is a place of roosters, each Battleking asked to crow louder than the last, using their iron to forge frills and bright courting feathers only to be pierced by arrows that plain chainmail would render a joke. To this city we will ship iron, for there is talent here, ancient as none in the Ynn but us Brelari, but most importantly to this city, we shall ship ur practicality, for the people of Malacnar lived by vain and fleeting self-aggrandizing, now let them know lasting greatness. To the City of Warriors bring the knowledge of the Ironfolk, bring them an unwavering legacy instead of blazes of glory, bring them calm perseverance instead of frantic struggle against futility, by deed and word make the Hot Fire of the Warrior into the Cold Steel of a true Soldier."

Confusing for so remote a place as Brelar to be home to such courtly schemes, fitting for the Imperial city of Arverynn or the fair castles of Amacimst or fallen Amaceped. Perhaps if the Mayor were a talented enough schemer we could find out from where these rumours come, we might even have a lead already…"

Based out of the towns of Brelar, staunch allies to the Dynasty of yen Dolin, and home to the yen Brelar who succeeded them, this is the Order of the Mountain Eye. Mere candles remain of the fiery gaze of red hot iron which served ruthlessly the Yrisar in Vareynn and Arverynn in their passing, but we possess the power to change this. Grant the Order funds, grant them people, spread their gaze across Dolindha as it was over the entire Ynn of old, reignite this elusive force as we did our forges, and we shall surely see vast benefits."

In this place of whispered deals, fair words and yet fairer sights and smells let us plant a seed of darkness. Better to infiltrate courts and castles than our commoners are our nobles, to Grebniesth we shall bring them, where in beautiful pavilions they shall be taught the ugliest arts.

But there is pride in this people yet, and should we bring out their pride they will not defend their arrogant purple-cloaked overlords were we to attack. For no doubt the Amethyst Lord will never stoop so low as to ask for help from his oathkeeper, aid shall be demanded as a baron ordering a peasant, and the descendants of Komerjon shan't bow to demands"

 g27_strike_amacimst_desc:0 "Strong is the will of the Eastern Castle, bold are its people, yet the fear of the unknown plagues them to such a degree that they sooner let their people fall to Cursed-One raids than adopt new tactics or weapons. And sooner will they see their castle razed than see a peasant wielding a sword. This is a detriment to Dolindha, and as such it is the will of the Republic to eliminate these reactionary elements that the borders of the cursed forest remain protected. We shall oust the fearful cowards in charge of the Amethyst order and invite their banished knights home, the new Amethyst order will defend Dolindha from real enemies, not ones made up by old and paranoid Lords."

Once it was grand, with tall domed towers, stout bridges and gold-stained windows. It's people clad in garments in all colours of the rainbow, for such were the days of the Yrisars. No more is it so, the streets of Vareynn are home to ghosts, the people have long moved into farms and castles and left the old palaces to rot by rain and wind in the mournful moonlight once bright across the tall walls... \n\nSo come Brelari, bring to Vareynn new life in stone and marble, it is time for towers to be restored, bridges renewed and windows refitted, it is time for us to bring the renewal birthed in Brelar to our allies in the Eternal Castle."

The Boats, as the Patrician faction was called, are now tasked with funding projects for the Rivers, the clerical faction, even ones so humiliating as the celebration of their own fall. To support the return of Bosancovac into a republic is only natural, especially since the Rivers certainly haven't dealt with any of the social issues the Boats were accused of causing, corruption festers in their upper classes and threatens to spread beyond their borders, it must be rectified and fast."

Upon this reservoir lies the somewhat dilapidated floating city, neglect from corruption wears at its foundations and slums on rafts tread water around its edges. The new Bosancovaco republic is aided by Brelar, and the Order of the Mountain Eye will show no tolerance for swindling or negligence in its rule, resources from our rich mountains will be used to reinforce the Dam and the City, and the Reservoir shall see prosperity as never before."

 g27_argan_bulwark_title:0 "Vers Argan Bulwark"
 g27_argan_bulwark_desc:0 ""A summary of collected reports over a decade strengthened in Mayor Kravendil Saskjaro's head the idea that the raids of Cursed Ones and those committed by Rzentur tribes were a matter requiring more effort than the Patricians currently gave it. In the Brelari method, a commission was set to ponder this issue, leading to the proposal of new fortifications along the borders of Vers Argan, as well as mandated oversight and funding on the part of the Nobility. This reform proved initially unpopular due to its expensive nature and Patricians and Commoners alike frowning upon such responsibility being entrusted to the Nobility, who were little trusted to uphold the ideals of the republic. However, in time a reduction in raids was clearly felt among the people of Brelar and thus the Argan Bulwark is counted among the many solid policies adopted under Saskjaro's period as Mayor." \n\n- Excerpt from "The people of Hrilar" by Erendej yod Hrilynn, 1841"

 g27_second_bulwark_desc:0 "Just as the people of Brelar are beset by Cursed One raids, so are the people of Amacimst to our east. Moreso than us even, for their lords favour jousts and plays to patrols and brick laying, leading to regular major incursions across their border despite the supposed vigilance of the Amethyst Order. To aid the farmers is a task laid before us, and having protected the Argan mountains no doubt we can fortify the plains, the building of forts shall at least prove easier than hauling marble up the mountainsides, and perhaps it may even sow some loyalty in our eastern kin."

These are remnants of forts by which the Republic held at bay both the knights of Amacimst to their east and the hosts of the Gospodh to their west, the sheer quantity would surprise anyone who did not understand the spirit of Hrilar, but even more would people be surprised by the dating of these forts. The oldest may be counted as hillforts built in the days of Stantirvare, and ancient Malacnar, yet the newest be counted but decades before their fall to the Gospodh, the architecture clearly evolves yet is based on the same original principle, thus many argue the nation pursued a continuous fortification program over the course of almost two thousand years. Their full number is not known as of yet, but the documents of the Council in the year 1792, during the height of Havoral, state that a survey on defence concluded the fortification complex was such that each citizen of the Republic may easily be fitted into a well-resourced and sturdy fort should bombardment or assault on Brelar commence" \n\n- Excerpt from "The people of Hrilar" by Erendej yod Hrilynn, 1841"

For this reason, it would be folly to do the same as we did in Dolindha and aim to subjugate the rzentan lords. There exists however, a place in which kinship and understanding between the Ynn and the followers of the Dragon has been fostered, thus to the people of Lisicalrevo we shall give our trust, and task this gifted people with the efforts of spreading representative rule to the west."

It is not well, they say, that Rzenta be ruled by a Dolindhan council in a Dolindhan province. No matter the devotion of our Rzentan sister republic to their god Varlengeilt resentment among their people still festers. Thus they wish to form a majority-rzentur parliament, based in the holy city of Svemel, Fisvare in our tongue.

Vast tracks of fertile and verdant forest lie north of the fortresses in Gozhar Urthid and Gomosengha, populated by the Old Rzentur, the people who remained in the woods instead of settling in what at the time was Upper Dolindha, and swearing fealty to the Yrisar. It is now time to settle these lands, to bring to them security from the fey and wendigo who prowl the forest, once more we turn to the Rzentan Parliament, for another task we are to place ahead of them."

Let not the word of Rzentur be weighted less than the word of Brelari settler or Dolindhan towns-elf, for the enlightenment and the efficient administration of Breluslad the votes of the western people, and all other present and future members of the North Ynnic Confluence shall be merged with the main Parliament, let all have their voices heard in the Halls of the Hills’ Confluence!"

In its declaration of the full pursuit of republicanism, Brelar has lost much of its legitimacy, and few would oppose the conquest of Dolindha by foreign powers to replace our rule, however fair we try to make it. Whispers are brought to the Mayor by the Order of the Mountain Eye, ambitions and plots to cross the Ynn, worrying threats of invasion. Already at the crossings are the Brelari Dam Architects, let us to the dams bring also our fortification experts.

From the North descends the history of the Brefineis, weary yet tough, triumphant over the forces of tyranny that sought to end the fires of republicanism at the roots of the mountain.

Especially in Brelar and Vers Argan the sentiment that the settlers had more representation in their governance was cause for upheaval. Systems similar to those in the colonies were implemented, though more integrated into the Republic’s administration. The partaking in the elections was not so great as among the settlers, as few Dolindhans outside Brelar cared much for such things. This culture of elections became seen as a final sign among the people that Brelar had drifted from Dolindhan culture, and in their new ambitions, combined with old tradition, forged something entirely new."

These administrations go by the name of Colonial Governments and serve to keep their people under the thumbs of overlords an ocean away, whilst at the same time refusing to acknowledge the legitimate sovereignty of Ruinborn governments. A ridiculous sentiment, these settlers deserve their right to rule themselves, to not answer to some king across the sea. Let the armies march East, new rivers shall flow into the Confluence ere these tyrants learn whose ire they summoned."

 g27_watermills_marbleworks_title:0 "Watermills and Marbleworks"
 g27_watermills_marbleworks_desc:0 "“Oh the Yrisars of old laid stone in the Ynn \nto carry elves across its breadth. \nAnd gates in the stone did they carve in turn \nthat ship still may pass down its length. \nSuch gates of stone no arm could budge, nor chained beast e’en wield, \nBut to the force of the waters flowing ever down even mountains’ child must yield” \n\n- Verse from “The Founding of the Great Dams” depicting the religious significance of the use of waterwheels to peoples of the Ynnic faith. An ambition of Brelar has long been to renovate the ancient Brefineis watermill around which the town once was birthed. With safety restored to Dolindha and the Great Dams well studied now is the time to commence this long-awaited project, but let us not restrict our efforts to Brelar alone, to prove our ambition to unite the Ynn we shall reinvigorate waterwheels across all Dolindha, and soon all the River Valley."

 g27_ynnside_canals_title:0 "Ynnside Canals"
 g27_ynnside_canals_desc:0 "Willful is the Holy Ynn, wild its deep waters and irritable its deadly floods. Yet around the river and its tributaries still lies all ynnic civilisation, the dams serving to prevent the larger floods which once ravaged the settlement of old. To further safeguard the people of the Ynn we will use the expertise of the Brelari Dam Architects to reinforce the Great Dams, as well as construct dikes and dams on a smaller scale, on tributaries rather than the main river. By this method, the whims of the river will be less wrothful upon our subjects and the trade routes of the main river more accessible to the outer tributaries."

 g27_dambuilder_knowledge_title:0 "Dam-Builders' Knowledge"
 g27_dambuilder_knowledge_desc:0 "The Great Dams are wonders of engineering, used for transport and for the regulation of the cyclical floods of the Stuir Balia. They are also a symbol of the faith, of the empire, and of the ingenuity and might of the Ynnic people. Thus we have an excellent opportunity ahead of us, the restoration of the great symbols of Ynnic unity shall be our first step toward proving our right to the Empire."

 g27_renovate_bacar_title:0 "Renovate Vels Bacar"
 g27_renovate_bacar_desc:0 "One of the more physically present legacies of the Brelari Emperors of old is the Dam of Vels Bacar. Preceded by a wooden bridge, the dam was a project initiated and completed by Yrisar Demirad yen Brelar, the first of the Brelari dynasty. Fitting it is then that the duty of bringing the dam back to proper order and magnificence falls to his successors."

 g27_edge_world_title:0 "The Edge of the World"
 g27_edge_world_desc:0 "To Adbrabohvi all the world’s water arrives, along with all the souls of elves to pass into the netherworld. Here lies the edge of Ynnic civilisation, a place of temples and solemnity. Here too, even in the home of the greatest temple of the Ynnic Faith, the Great Dam has fallen into disrepair. Thus once more we summon the Dam Architects, once more they must do their all, for the restoration of the Holy City no resources may be spared."

 g27_knights_dome_title:0 "Knights of the Dome"
 g27_knights_dome_desc:0 "To here, to Stanyrhrada, under the protection of the Golden Dome, the capital of the Yrisars was moved in 674, an outrage to many in Dolindha at the time. Thus it is well remembered in Stanyrhrada that they once were the greatest seat of power, and well remembered it is also that the reign of the yen Brelar dynasty was held from the Golden Dome throughout its succession. The loyalty of the Order of the Dome, golden knights of worthy skill, is an asset we are uniquely able to secure, as in our reinvestment in the city and its castles we shall prove that the memory of the greatness of Stanyrhrada lives well-mortared in the minds of Brelari rulers."

 g27_teal_keep_title:0 "The Teal Keep"
 g27_teal_keep_desc:0 "Successors to the yen Brelar were House Vyrekynn, under their reign was the court of the Yrisar moved to Arverynn, where in the lavish Teal Keep it remained until its tragic fall. Not so lavish stands the keep in its current state, and even less maintained is the city. For where once there was the centre of Ynnic might there is now poverty and disease, spells are used by the locals to show illusions of the city’s former grandeur to its residents and visitors. A horrid lie, the legacy of the Empire cannot be allowed to fester like an untended wound, swiftly the Teal Keep and the city of Arverynn must be cured!"

 g27_treehouse_rangers_title:0 "Treehouse Rangers"
 g27_treehouse_rangers_desc:0 "As the Cursed Ones and Old Rzentur raid the borders of the North, so do the Epednar and Veykodans raid the South. To defend and alert of such raids the Sardan employ Treehouse rangers, elves who live far from civilisation in treetop homes, and prowl the edges of the Ynnic lands to prevent loathsome buycev aggression. These rangers shall have our support, for we have weapons of great quantity and quality. With their aid, we shall use the stone of the crumbling old Sardan castles to fortify the border, that the work of a ranger may become safer and easier."

 g27_wild_west_title:0 "The Wild West"
 g27_wild_west_desc:0 "Where Brelar is bleak and cold, with damp gullies and snow-tipped peaks, Sarda is warm and fair, its fields vast and verdant and its weather mild. It is no wonder the Yrisars moved their capital south to live in this warmth and ease, to govern away from harsh forests and icy winds. Sarda is now once more under the rule of Brelar, and in this landscape, there is a place most important that deserves our attention."

 g27_restore_functionaries_title:0 "Imperial Functionaries"
 g27_restore_functionaries_desc:0 "The key actions of the Brelari Emperors were in their implementations of administrative reforms, including several censuses to the size of provinces to account for the seasonal shifts the Stuir Balia causes in fertility. Often unspoken is the yen Brelar dynasty’s abhorrence toward corruption, where favouritism and backdoor deals were a staple of both the yen Dolin and Vyrekynn regimes, the Brelari Yrisars enforced strict regulations on Lords, and instituted a system of functionaries to ensure the wheels of their reign turned as smoothly as the waterwheels back home. Over the Dark Ages corruption has seeped into every corner of the former empire, thus it is time to restore the functionaries that we may uproot this decadence once and for all."

 g27_return_yenbrelar_title:0 "Return of the Yen Brelar"
 g27_return_yenbrelar_desc:0 "Bright did the bells ring in Adbrabohvi in the spring of 761 when Demirad yen Brelar was crowned Emperor of the Ynnics, bells rang in celebration, in welcome, for the new Yrisar. The yen Brelar proved themselves worthy rulers through embodying the most central ynnic ideal, constancy and change. For their constancy was in justice, and strong decrees, fearing no opposition the throne was mighty in their day and rebellion was quelled in swift force. Change was in their aim for prosperity, to redraw the provinces and review their produce, to ensure no land was left wanting due to poor harvest in the wane of the river or flooding in its wax. Thus in giving prosperity and justice to the ynn, we may hope to have made our ancestors proud."

 g27_fallen_emperors_title:0 "Fallen Emperors"
 g27_fallen_emperors_desc:0 "With the Teal Keep in magnanimous shape, as once it was in the days of Vyrekynn glory, we have given to the last imperial dynasty a seat worthy of their name. Joyous do their banners fly across walls, walkways and towers, in celebration of the return of Arverynn’s legendary beauty. Proud and set in their ways though the Vyrekynns may be, no longer can they deny the greatness of the Republic and its claim to the Empire."

 g27_legacy_amstenur_title:0 "Legacy of Amstenur"
 g27_legacy_amstenur_desc:0 "Amstenur, the ancient Walled City of the Sarda lies in ruin since the unification of the Ynn. Little remains of its colossal walls, for their stone was used in great quantity for the construction of the Great Dams. A short ride west leads one to the city’s heirs; the yen Stenur dynasty is the fruit of the union sung of as “The Riverwall Marriage” for it was between the Dolindhan lord Calasanqir and the princess of Amstenur and first it came among unions between Sarda and Dolindhan as no such wedding occurred before. By this legitimacy, the yen Stenur have ever watched over Sarda in the desire to keep its prosperity flowing. And for maintaining this legacy we shall gain their support."

 g27_strangers_west_title:0 "Strangers in the West"
 g27_strangers_west_desc:0 "Where once the Epednar roamed free and unchallenged now new settlements and peoples traverse. Not a repeat of the folly that was the attempts of the Empire to settle the plains, for these people are come from below the falls; Krahnorians we name them. To defeat the Epednar hordes they use loud weapons of flame and steel, which may be fired at long ranges as a bow. Many among the Ynnic nobility claim such warfare is for cowards, but then again they said the same of Republics once…"

 g27_northern_heathens_title:0 "Western Heathens"
 g27_northern_heathens_desc:0 "The Rzentur's push west has long been a concern to Dolindha, and it is now time for the warriors of the republic to end this looming threat. Well-versed are the dragon’s warriors in facing knights and bold charges, let us see how they fare against the swift manoeuvres and withering endurance wars of the Brefineis tradition."

 g27_dragon_lords_title:0 "Dragon Lords"
 g27_dragon_lords_desc:0 "The Rzentur once served the Yrisar as loyally as any other ynnic people and paid homage to the Great River instead of a false Dragon God. Now that both Drozmagog and his son, Varlengeilt, are slain they can no longer deny their rightful god is none but the Ynn, and their rightful lord is the lord of Brelar."

 g27_strangers_east_title:0 "Strangers in the East"
 g27_strangers_east_desc:0 "In the East the chiefs and petty kings of Veykoda are rapidly being displaced by new nations. With foreign names and traditions more foreign, a people has emerged out of the netherworld. They hold gods such as Corin, the red-haired sky-goddess of war and Nerat, a red skeleton who judges the dead on a scale, and they hold ambition for new lives in our valley. The question is whether we let them spread their thoughts and traditions in the land of the Ynnics, or whether we must combat these dangerous ideas that they do not harm our way of life."

 g27_our_monopoly_title:0 "Our Monopoly"
 g27_our_monopoly_desc:0 "Iron and its products have long been the pride of Brelar, and long have we held the monopoly on its trade along the Great River. Yet now a people of the East, the dwarves, have proven to be equal if not greater in their skill in forging than our masters. These dwarves may prove a threat to our craft, but on the other hand, bringing their expertise to Brelar is also likely to prove a bountiful prospect."

#old tales in the ironhouses
 flavour_brelar.1.t:0 "Old Tales in the Ironhouses"
 flavour_brelar.1.d:0 "Cold mountain air seeped in through the wooden walls and made the crew huddle together around the rough grey smelting kilns, taking care not to get in the way of any elves still carrying around iron in glowing urns with thickly-gloved hands or cooling bars in huge tongs. On evenings like this, the older elves would share stories, tales of climbing mountains in their youth or of hunts or the wars of the Yrisars, sometimes even sharing tales of old brefineis like the Battle of the Wooden Bridge or the arrival of the Ride of Lukaus at the foot of the Argan range in days when Dolindha was yet empty. Tonight an old elf talks of a strange bridgebuilder he once worked for, he laughingly explains how the elf used to measure every plank and rock and then spend hours pondering over writings and drawings before letting people actually get to work, and inexplicably stop their work to measure more and place some strange stick with water against the woodwork. What in the name of the River was going on with that engineer the old elf could not say, but the bridges he had them build have never fallen through their long years, not even in the roughest of the Great Ynn’s floods."

 flavour_brelar.2.d:0 "“I doth write briefly unto this paper whilst I most uncomfortably hide behind barrels and ropes. Goodman Boric of Brelar hath granted me a place in his cart that I may pass from the ruinous lands of Vysamsto unmolested, or so I hope. Beside me is a pile of woollens with which I am to cover myself once called, thus keeping from being seen by the guards. I pray to the Great River that my family doth remain safe at Mocbarja, though I think it foolish to believe the lords retain any honour to not slay the family of their declared foe when I hath witnessed their abandonment of Imperial rule so swiftly when moment appeared. Fearful am I of what should become of Dolindha doth the rightful emperor not soon march north, yet more fearful am I of my beloved Mocbarja. How am I to live knowing its gears shall rust shut and its floodgates crumble in mine and my fellows’ absence, how am I to go on knowing Ynnic lords did heinously spill the blood of the faithful on her pavement? Brelar remaineth undeclared, may the Ynn smile upon me and the Mayor allow me refuge, the only hope left to me is that I may live to return to the Dam when Vyrekynn banners once more fly in the North, my sole bid to life is that they will not be allowed to deca- that is Goodman Boric telling me we hath arrived at the gate, again I beseech the River: let not this be the last I write.”"
