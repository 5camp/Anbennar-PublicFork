While this was initially disruptive and led to a decrease in discipline and organization, it also had as an immediate effect that it greatly increased the manpower pool the state could draw from. This allowed the Jadd Empire to pull on greater amounts of men than their neighbours."

So the Jadd Empire followed a practise of leaving local administrations in tact to cause minimal disruption. Where feudal systems existed, the local lords needed to report to the imperial governor, but the rest was left in tact. The same occured with more modern administrations. Only in very tribal systems with no clear power structure order was brought by restructuring the local systems, but local chiefs still stayed in power. Of course all of this if they did not revolt. This system allowed large areas to be swiftly integrated and reduced the need for forming new local administrations."

 F51_restructure_the_legions_desc:0 "The old Phoenix Legions underwent great changes since the Sun Elves first landed on shores of Bulwar. The experience they gained while campaigning through Sarhal and Haless made them strong. The adaptation to the eastern Salahad made them crafty. The next reform would leave them changed to an even greater degree. The mixing of different races into the army would have made them unrecognisable to Jaher's army. However the experience and drill of their veterans forged these different groups into one force, now also driven by a common purpose: To defend and to spread the Light of the Jadd."

Until the Jadd Empire stepped in and reconnected the ancient Bulwari lands with its core lands around the Mountain of Clear Sight. A new highway was constructed in the place of the old one, recreating the connection between Haless and Bulwar. Its control gave the Jadd greater power over its trade and also allowed swift movement of troops from one end of the empire to another."

 F51_increase_lightbringer_jurisdiction_desc:0 "The order of Lightbringers was a class of warriors, scribes, rhetoricians and clerics that had as a task to safeguard the light within the state. Their tasks mainly revolved around seeking out heathens and heretics and either making them see the light, or bringing them to trial. In the days of the Jadd Empire their powers were extended to bypass the courts and to instantly deal with anyone who did not comply with the tenants of the faith. This would lead to occassional riots and more than one instance of the burning of innocents, but it did quicken the spread of the faith within the Empire."

The Sun Cult proclaimed Jaher to be the god's reincarnation, and when he died the Sun Elves were appointed as the successors. Jaddar claimed that all people who follow the truth would be Sura'el's successors. In turn those who follow the Jadd see their leader as the Divine Herald and the voice of the Sun God."

And in turn, the vast quantities of the metal that the dwarves retrieved from the depths of the mountains threatened the stability of the nation's treasury. To create some relative stability, the council of clans had a massive vault constructed, where all the gold that was mined would be stored. Then they created a new institution, that of the Vault Magistrates. It was their job to carefully measure the quantities of gold in the vault and to always track the stores. They had to determine when it would be wise or unwise to tap into the Citadel's gold supply, and by their skill they stabilized Verkal Gulan's economy."

The King's Gate faces the Dwarovar. It was opened rarely during the time when the mountains were overrun by goblins and orcs, but as the dwarovar was reclaimed by dwarves they were open more often than not. The gate is decorated with depictions of dwarven craftsmanship and great feats of engineering. The Miner's Gate faces the underneath.

The great halls and public works that sprang up in that time hearkened back to the glorydays of the Dwarovar.
