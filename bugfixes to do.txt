+the event allclan.21 has allclan_longer_terms on options 2 and 3, where 3 should probably have allclan_shorter_terms
+g_serpentspine_diplomacy checks for orcish tolerance for the dwarf ally in the trigger
+allclan.9 is all provinces you own anywhere which might be too much

+g_building_a_rocket_test_site has no fallback if you don't own one of the three requirements (but can still be clicked)

finishing industrialisation is very messy:
+ there's wool in the dwarovar in 1444, which isn't currently a farm or artifice good (so you can never have the required all roads industrialised)
+ there are caverns that don't border a road or hold, which means they can't have quarrying (so you can never have the required all caverns industrialised)
+ the allclan_hold_mega_industry decision only checks artifice_mining_check but can build in every hold - which means you can get the industry on farming holds
+ glass is a has_valid_artifice_mining_good = yes good, but the industry building doesn't apply the glass modifier to it unless it's from swapping gems (which leads to mega industry being permanently clickable if you have orghlehovar)
+ random_lists in buildings have fixed RNG so you'll either never have goods swap or have one good always swap on completion - also either zero or one goblin wonder per run
