g_creating_farms_for_the_orcs mission has no effect (looks unfinished in files)

allclan_rocket_prep decision is clickable until the actual rocket launch (which is a lot of rockets)

allclan_orc_farming triggered modifier requires all vale provinces, including the roads

g_consolidating_the_councils_rule mission can be difficult due to hold modifiers to min autonomy (if an AI devs a lot) - you have no parliament seats to offset hold autonomy

g_they_called_us_mad mission requires 800 mil but doesn't take it away

coffee trading bonus is difficult, as most coffee is in Aelantir by the time you get to it

g_industrial_cavern_quarrying mission was impossible this run because there were only 27 valid road farming provinces - add a bypass for all valid provinces?

allclan_industry_rng doesn't remove the building or add province mods, but does remove itself

effects that kill my ruler don't seem to work

MonthsSinceKinstrife doesn't increment properly

Industrialisation using artificer privileges makes the flow annoying as you have to wait for a loyalty event to revoke and move on

the effect of the tiny industrialisation mods for non-'wonder' trade goods is mostly to flood parts of the UI with +0.2% modifiers, for example the manpower listing

ruined rail can't be rebuilt if it borders rocket rail, if you just forgot to state something for ages(edited)

I'd check industry more but it's borked

early industrialisation is almost impossible if you aren't doing something cursed like Regent Court Allclan:
- first step is food on roads, 500 months base
- next step is food in caverns, 800 months for quarrying
- next step is caverns and roads done, 800 months
- last step is holds, 2000 months

you realistically have 45 or less years for it to matter at all since you need to wait for englightenment and coal
which means you have about 540 months
which means you need -90% build time to finish - in every step

take the last step, holds: you'll semi-reliably have -10% from ghetto, -50% from minorities, -20% from mages, -25% from the faction and -5% from your ideas, maybe another -5% from railskulker
that's 115 which is great except higher hold levels have construction speed penalties - a level 8 hold, which you probably have by 1700, turns that into 85% which means the step still takes 300 months
a single level 9 hold that lost one level of a minority and you're locked out of it completely

roads and caverns have much less reliable access to dwarves and goblins and kobolds, and lack the ghetto, so they could be -75%, which if on food means the first step takes 125 months and the second probably the same - also locking you out of it completely if you have a level 8 hold
