####Mounts
##To add a new mount type, you MUST prefix it with: "mythical_riders_"
#your modifier MUST include "is_hussars_modifier = yes"
#to enable the mount you use "enable_mythical_riders = { mount = x }" where x is the name of the mount you put in your modifier name. 
#Example: if your modifier is "mythical_riders_drakon" you would use "enable_mythical_riders = { mount = drakon }"

#this is an example and not currently available ingame
mythical_riders_drakon = {
	is_hussars_modifier = yes
	cavalry_shock = 0.5
	morale_damage = 0.75
	reinforce_speed = -0.25
	reinforce_cost_modifier = 0.25
